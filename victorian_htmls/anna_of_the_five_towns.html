<p/>ANNA OF THE FIVE TOWNS




<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>THE KINDLING OF LOVE

<p/>The yard was all silent and empty under the burning afternoon heat,
which had made its asphalt springy like turf, when suddenly the
children threw themselves out of the great doors at either end of the
Sunday-school--boys from the right, girls from the left--in two
howling, impetuous streams, that widened, eddied, intermingled and
formed backwaters until the whole quadrangle was full of clamour and
movement. Many of the scholars carried prize-books bound in vivid
tints, and proudly exhibited these volumes to their companions and to
the teachers, who, tall, languid, and condescending, soon began to
appear amid the restless throng. Near the left-hand door a little girl
of twelve years, dressed in a cream coloured frock, with a wide and
heavy straw hat, stood quietly kicking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) foal-like legs against the
wall. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was one of those who had won a prize, and once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
took the treasure from under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm to glance at its frontispiece with
a vague smile of satisfaction. For a time her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright eyes were fixed
expectantly on the doorway; then they would wander, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) started to
count the windows of the various Connexional buildings which on three
sides enclosed the yard--chapel, school, lecture-hall, and
chapel-keeper's house. Most of the children had already squeezed
through the narrow iron gate into the street beyond, where a steam-car
was rumbling and clattering up Duck Bank, attended by its immense
shadow. The teachers remained a little behind. Gradually dropping the
pedagogic pose, and happy in the virtuous sensation of duty
accomplished, they forgot the frets and fatigues of the day, and grew
amiably vivacious among themselves. With an instinctive mutual
complacency the two sexes mixed again after separation. Greetings and
pleasantries were exchanged, and intimate conversations begun; and
then, dividing into small familiar groups, the young men and women
slowly followed their pupils out of the gate. The chapel-keeper, who
always had an injured expression, left the white step of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) residence,
and, walking with official dignity across the yard, drew down the
side-windows of the chapel one after another. As he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) approached the
little solitary girl in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) course he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a reluctant acid
recognition; then he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hearth. Agnes was alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, young lady?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>ARTIST</b></font>) looked round with a jump, and blushed, smiling and screwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>ARTIST</b></font>)
little shoulders, when she (<font color='blue'><b>ARTIST</b></font>) recognised the two men who were coming
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>ARTIST</b></font>) from the door of the lecture-hall. The one who had called
out was Henry Mynors, morning superintendent of the Sunday-school and
conductor of the men's Bible-class held in the lecture-hall on Sunday
afternoons. The other was William Price, usually styled Willie Price,
secretary of the same Bible-class, and son of Titus Price, the
afternoon superintendent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you don't deserve that prize. Let me see if it isn't too
good for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors smiled playfully down upon Agnes Tellwright as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) idly turned the leaves of the book which she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now,
do you deserve it? Tell me honestly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) scrutinised those sparkling and vehement black eyes with the
fearless calm of infancy. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) answered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) high, thin
voice, having at length decided within herself that Mr. Mynors was
joking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I suppose you must have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) admitted, with a fine air of
giving way.

<p/>As Agnes took the volume from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thought how perfect a man Mr.
Mynors was. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) eyes, so kind and sincere, and that mysterious,
delicious, inexpressible something which dwelt behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) eyes: these
constituted an ideal for her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).

<p/>Willie Price stood somewhat apart, grinning, and pulling a thin
honey-coloured moustache. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was at the uncouth, disjointed age,
twenty-one, and nine years younger than Henry Mynors. Despite a
continual effort after ease of manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was often sheepish and
self-conscious, even, as now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) could discover no reason for such
a condition of mind. But Agnes liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) simple, pale blue
eyes had a wistfulness which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) feel towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) felt
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) doll when she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) happened to find it lying neglected on the
floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your big sister isn't out of school yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors remarked.

<p/>Agnes shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I've been waiting ever so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) said
plaintively.

<p/>At that moment a grey-haired woman with a benevolent but rather pinched
face emerged with much briskness from the girls' door. This was Mrs.
Sutton, a distant relative of Mynors'--his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) mother had been her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) second
cousin. The men raised their hats.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been down to make sure of some of you slippery folks for the
sewing-meeting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, shaking hands with Mynors, and including
both him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) and Willie Price in an embracing maternal smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
short-sighted and did not perceive Agnes, who had fallen back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had a good class this afternoon, Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton's breathing was
short and quick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said, `very good indeed.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're doing a grand work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We had over seventy present,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I make nothing of numbers. Henry. I meant a _good_
class. Doesn't it say--Where _two or three_ are gathered together...?
But I must be getting on. The horse will be restless. I've to go up
to Hillport before tea. Mrs. Clayton Vernon is ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Scarcely having stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) active course, Mrs. Sutton drew the men
along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) down the yard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) and Mynors in rapid talk: Willie
Price fell a little to the rear, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) big hands half-way into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) eyes diffidently roving. It appeared as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
could not find courage to take a share in the conversation, yet was
anxious to convince himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) right to do so.

<p/>Mynors helped Mrs. Sutton into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) carriage, which had been drawn up
outside the gate of the school yard. Only two families of the Bursley
Wesleyan Methodists kept a carriage, the Suttons and the Clayton
Vernons. The latter, boasting lineage and a large house in the
aristocratic suburb of Hillport, gave to the society monetary aid and a
gracious condescension. But though indubitably above the operation of
any unwritten sumptuary law, even the Clayton Vernons ventured only in
wet weather to bring their carriage to chapel. Yet Mrs. Sutton, who
was a plain woman, might with impunity use her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) equipage on Sundays.
This license granted by Connexional opinion was due to the fact that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) so obviously regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) carriage, not as a carriage, but as a
contrivance on four wheels for enabling an infirm creature to move
rapidly from place to place. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) got into it she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had exactly the
air of a doctor on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rounds. Mrs. Sutton's bodily frame had long ago
proved inadequate to the ceaseless demands of a spirit indefatigably
altruistic, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) continuance in activity was a notable illustration
of the dominion of mind over matter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) husband, a potter's valuer
and commission agent, made money with facility in that lucrative
vocation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) wife's charities were famous, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
attempts to hide them. Neither husband nor wife had allowed riches to
put a factitious gloss upon their primal simplicity. They were as they
were, save that Mr. Sutton had joined the Five Towns Field Club and
acquired some of the habits of an archaeologist. The influence of
wealth on manners was to be observed only in their daughter Beatrice,
who, while favouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother, dressed at considerable expense, and
at intervals gave much time to the arts of music and painting. Agnes
watched the carriage drive away, and then turned to look up the stairs
within the school doorway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sighed, scowled, and sighed again,
murmured something to herself, and finally began to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not come out yet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) side once more, alone this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, wearied. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) is. Anna, what
ages you've been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna Tellwright</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna Tellwright stood motionless for a second in the shadow of the
doorway. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was tall, but not unusually so, and sturdily built up.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) figure, though the bust was a little flat, had the lenient curves
of absolute maturity. Anna had been a woman since seventeen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was now on the eve of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) twenty-first birthday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wore a plain,
home-made light frock checked with brown and edged with brown velvet,
thin cotton gloves of cream colour, and a broad straw hat like her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
sister's. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) grave face, owing to the prominence of the cheekbones
and the width of the jaw, had a slight angularity; the lips were thin,
the brown eyes rather large, the eyebrows level, the nose fine and
delicate; the ears could scarcely be seen for the dark brown hair which
was brushed diagonally across the temples, leaving of the forehead only
a pale triangle. It seemed a face for the cloister, austere in
contour, fervent in expression, the severity of it mollified by that
resigned and spiritual melancholy peculiar to women who through the
error of destiny have been born into a wrong environment.

<p/>As if charmed forward by Mynors' compelling eyes, Anna stepped into the
sunlight, at the same time putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parasol. <div class="bookquote">``How calm and
stately she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cool hand and murmured
a reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) salutation. But even his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) aquiline gaze could not
surprise the secrets of that concealing breast: this was one of the
three great tumultuous moments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) realised for the first
time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was loved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are late this afternoon, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>Mynors began, with the
easy inflections of a man well accustomed to prominence in the society
of women. Little Agnes seized Anna's left arm, silently holding up the
prize, and Anna nodded appreciation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said as they walked across the yard, `one of my girls has
been doing wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stole a Bible from another girl, so of course I
had to mention it to the superintendent. Mr. Price gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a long
lecture, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is waiting upstairs till he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) is ready to go with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) home and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parents. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) must be
dismissed.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dismissed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna's look flashed a grateful response to him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>). By the least possible
emphasis he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had expressed a complete disagreement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) senior
colleague which etiquette forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) to utter in words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's a very great pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``I rather like the
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ventured in haste; `you might speak to Mr. Price about it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) mentions it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, I meant that. Mr. Price said--if it had been anything else but a
_Bible_--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Um!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) murmured very low, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) caught the significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
intonation. They did not glance at each other: it was unnecessary.
Anna felt that comfortable easement of the spirit which springs from
the recognition of another spirit capable of understanding without
explanations and of sympathising without a phrase. Under that calm
mask a strange and sweet satisfaction thrilled through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
precious instinct of common sense--rarest of good qualities, and pining
always for fellowship--found a companion in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had dreaded
the overtures which for a fortnight past she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had foreseen were
inevitably to come from Mynors: he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was a stranger, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) merely
respected. Now in a sudden disclosure she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) and liked him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). The
dire apprehension of those formal `advances' which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had watched
other men make to other women faded away. It was at once a release and
a reassurance.

<p/>They were passing through the gate, Agnes skipping round her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sister's
skirts, when Willie Price reappeared front the direction of the chapel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgotten something?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors inquired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) blandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye-es,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) stammered, clumsily raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) hat to Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exactly as Agnes had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) hesitated for a fraction of time,
and then went up the yard towards the lecture-hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes has been showing me her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) prize,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, as the three stood
together outside the gate. <div class="bookquote">``I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) really
deserves it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) does. What do you think, Miss Big
Sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna gave the little girl an affectionate smile of comprehension.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it called, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Janey's Sacrifice or the Spool of Cotton, and other stories for
children,'' (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>' Agnes read out in a monotone: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) clutched Anna's
elbow and aimed a whisper at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered aloud, `but we must be back by a
quarter-past four.'' And turning to Mynors: <div class="bookquote">``Agnes wants to go up to
the Park to hear the band play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going up there, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come along, Agnes, take my arm
and show me the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Shyly Agnes left her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sister's side and put a
pink finger into Mynors' hand.

<p/>Moor Road, which climbs over the ridge to the mining village of
Moorthorne and passes the new Park on its way, was crowded with people
going up to criticise and enjoy this latest outcome of municipal
enterprise in Bursley: sedate elders of the borough who smiled grimly
to see one another on Sunday afternoon in that undignified, idly
curious throng; white-skinned potters, and miners with the swarthy
pallor of subterranean toil; untidy Sabbath loafers whom neither church
nor chapel could entice, and the primly-clad respectable who had not
only clothes but a separate deportment for the seventh day; house-wives
whose pale faces, as of prisoners free only for a while, showed a naïve
and timorous pleasure in the unusual diversion; young women made
glorious by richly-coloured stuffs and carrying themselves with the
defiant independence of good wages earned in warehouse or
painting-shop; youths oppressed by stiff new clothes bought at
Whitsuntide, in which the bright necktie and the nosegay revealed a
thousand secret aspirations; young children running and yelling with
the marvellous energy of their years; here and there a small
well-dressed group whose studious repudiation of the crowd betrayed a
conscious eminence of rank; louts, drunkards, idiots, beggars, waifs,
outcasts, and every oddity of the town: all were more or less under the
influence of a new excitement, and all with the same face of pleased
expectancy looked towards the spot where, half-way up the hill, a
denser mass of sightseers indicated the grand entrance to the Park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What stacks of folks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``It's like going to a
football match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you go to football matches, Agnes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors asked. The child gave a
giggle.

<p/>Anna was relieved when these two began to chatter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had at once, by
a firm natural impulse, subdued the agitation which seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
found Mynors waiting with such an obvious intention at the school door;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had conversed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in tones of quiet ease; his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attitude had
even enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in a few moments to establish a pleasant familiarity
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Nevertheless, as they joined the stream of people in Moor
Road, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to be at home, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kitchen, in order to examine
herself and the new situation thus created by Mynors. And yet also she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) must remain at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) side, but it was a fluttered joy
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) presence gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), too strange for immediate appreciation. As
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eye, without directly looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), embraced the suave and
admirable male creature within its field of vision, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) became aware
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was quite inscrutable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). What were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) inmost thoughts,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) ideals, the histories of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) heart? Surely it was impossible that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should ever know these secrets! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>): they were utterly
foreign to each other. So the primary dissonances of sex vibrated
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own feelings puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Still, there was an
instant pleasure, delightful, if disturbing and inexplicable. And also
there was a sensation of triumph, which, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to scorn it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not banish. That a man and a woman should saunter together
on that road was nothing; but the circumstance acquired tremendous
importance when the man happened to be Henry Mynors and the woman Anna
Tellwright. Mynors--handsome, dark, accomplished, exemplary and
prosperous--had walked for ten years circumspect and unscathed amid the
glances of a whole legion of maids. As for Anna, the peculiarity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position had always marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for special attention: ever since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father settled in Bursley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt herself to be the object of
an interest in which awe and pity were equally mingled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) guessed
that the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) going to the Park with Mynors that afternoon would
pass swiftly from mouth to mouth like the rumour of a decisive event.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no friends; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) innate reserve had been misinterpreted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was not popular among the Wesleyan community. Many people would say,
and more would think, that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) money which was drawing Mynors
from the narrow path of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) celibate discretion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could imagine all
the innuendoes, the expressive nods, the pursing of lips, the lifting
of shoulders and of eyebrows. ``Money 'll do owt': that was the
proverb. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) cared not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had the just and unshakable
self-esteem which is fundamental in all strong and righteous natures;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) knew beyond the possibility of doubt that, though Mynors might
have no incurable aversion to a fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) herself, the spirit and
body of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), had been the sole awakener of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) desire.

<p/>By a common instinct, Mynors and Anna made little Agnes the centre of
attraction. Mynors continued to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and Agnes growing
courageous, began to retort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was now walking between them, and the
other two smiled to each other at the child's sayings over her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) head,
interchanging thus messages too subtle and delicate for the coarse
medium of words.

<p/>As they approached the Park the bandstand came into sight over the
railway cutting, and they could hear the music of <div class="bookquote">``The Emperor's Hymn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The crude, brazen sounds were tempered in their passage through the
warm, still air, and fell gently on the ear in soft waves, quickening
every heart to unaccustomed emotions. Children leaped forward, and old
people unconsciously assumed a lightsome vigour.

<p/>The Park rose in
terraces from the railway station to a street of small villas almost on
the ridge of the hill. From its gilded gates to its smallest
geranium-slips it was brand-new, and most of it was red. The keeper's
house, the bandstand, the kiosks, the balustrades, the shelters--all
these assailed the eye with a uniform redness of brick and tile which
nullified the pallid greens of the turf and the frail trees. The
immense crowd, in order to circulate, moved along in tight processions,
inspecting one after another the various features of which they had
read full descriptions in the ``Staffordshire Signal'--waterfall,
grotto, lake, swans, boat, seats, faïence, statues--and scanning with
interest the names of the donors so clearly inscribed on such objects
of art and craft as from divers motives had been presented to the town
by its citizens. Mynors, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) manoeuvred a way for the two girls
through the main avenue up to the topmost terrace, gravely judged each
thing upon its merits, approving this, condemning that. In deciding
that under all the circumstances the Park made a very creditable
appearance he (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) only reflected the best local opinion. The town was
proud of its achievement, and it had the right to be; for, though this
narrow pleasaunce was in itself unlovely, it symbolised the first faint
renascence of the longing for beauty in a district long given up to
unredeemed ugliness.

<p/>At length, Mynors having encountered many acquaintances, they got past
the bandstand and stood on the highest terrace, which was almost
deserted. Beneath them, in front, stretched a maze of roofs, dominated
by the gold angel of the Town Hall spire. Bursley, the ancient home of
the potter, has an antiquity of a thousand years. It lies towards the
north end of an extensive valley, which must have been one of the
fairest spots in Alfred's England, but which is now defaced by the
activities of a quarter of a million of people. Five contiguous
towns--Turnhill, Bursley, Hanbridge, Knype, and Longshaw--united by a
single winding thoroughfare some eight miles in length, have inundated
the valley like a succession of great lakes. Of these five Bursley is
the mother, but Hanbridge is the largest. They are mean and forbidding
of aspect--sombre, hard-featured, uncouth; and the vaporous poison of
their ovens and chimneys has soiled and shrivelled the surrounding
country till there is no village lane within a league but what offers a
gaunt and ludicrous travesty of rural charms. Nothing could be more
prosaic than the huddled, red-brown streets; nothing more seemingly
remote from romance. Yet be it said that romance is even here--the
romance which, for those who have an eye to perceive it, ever dwells
amid the seats of industrial manufacture, softening the coarseness,
transfiguring the squalor, of these mighty alchemic operations. Look
down into the valley from this terrace-height where love is kindling,
embrace the whole smoke-girt amphitheatre in a glance, and it may be
that you will suddenly comprehend the secret and superb significance of
the vast Doing which goes forward below. Because they seldom think,
the townsmen take shame when indicted for having disfigured half a
county in order to live. They have not understood that this
disfigurement is merely an episode in the unending warfare of man and
nature, and calls for no contrition. Here, indeed, is nature repaid
for some of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) notorious cruelties. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imperiously bids man sustain
and reproduce himself, and this is one of the places where in the very
act of obedience he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wounds and maltreats her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Out beyond the municipal
confines, where the subsidiary industries of coal and iron prosper amid
a wreck of verdure, the struggle is grim, appalling, heroic--so
ruthless is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) havoc of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so indomitable her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceaseless
recuperation. On the one side is a wresting from nature's own bowels
of the means to waste her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); on the other, an undismayed, enduring
fortitude. The grass grows; though it is not green, it grows. In the
very heart of the valley, hedged about with furnaces, a farm still
stands, and at harvest-time the sooty sheaves are gathered in.

<p/>The band stopped playing. A whole population was idle in the Park, and
it seemed, in the fierce calm of the sunlight, that of all the
strenuous weekday vitality of the district only a murmurous hush
remained. But everywhere on the horizon, and nearer, furnaces cast
their heavy smoke across the borders of the sky: the Doing was never
suspended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, still holding his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand, when they had been
silent a moment, `when do those furnaces go out?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't go out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) answered, `unless there is a strike. It costs
hundreds and hundreds of pounds to light them again.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) said vaguely. <div class="bookquote">``Father says it's the smoke that stops my
gilliflowers from growing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors turned to Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Your father seems the picture of health. I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out this morning at a quarter to seven, as brisk as a boy.
What a constitution!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied, `he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) is always up at six.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you aren't, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes interjected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how does Bursley compare with Hanbridge?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors continued. Anna
paused before replying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. ``At first--last year--I thought I
shouldn<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>``By the way, your father used to preach in Hanbridge circuit-----'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was years ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preach here? I dare say you know that we are rather
short of local preachers--good ones, that is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I can't say why father doesn't preach now:' Anna flushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``You had better ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I am coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soon--perhaps
one night next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna looked at Henry Mynors as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) uttered the astonishing words. The
Tellwrights had been in Bursley a year, but no visitor had crossed
their doorsteps except the minister, once, and such poor defaulters as
came, full of excuse and obsequious conciliation, to pay rent overdue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Business, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) might not be
intending to make a mere call of ceremony.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) answered lightly. <div class="bookquote">``But you will be in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered what the business could be,
and felt relieved to know that his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) visit would have at least some
assigned pretext; but already her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart beat with apprehensive
perturbation at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) presence in their household.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, whose eyes were everywhere, <div class="bookquote">``There's Miss Sutton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>Both Mynors and Anna looked sharply round. Beatrice Sutton was coming
towards them along the terrace. Stylishly clad in a dress of pink
muslin, with harmonious hat, gloves, and sunshade, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) made an
agreeable and rather effective picture, despite her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) plain, round face
and stoutish figure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had the air of being a leader. Grafted on to
the original simple honesty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) eyes there was the
unconsciously-acquired arrogance of one who had always been accustomed
to deference. Socially, Beatrice had no peer among the young women who
were active in the Wesleyan Sunday-school. Beatrice had been used to
teach in the afternoon school, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had recently advanced her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
labours from the afternoon to the morning in response to a hint that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) did so the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) influence and example might lessen the
chronic dearth of morning teachers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) came up. <div class="bookquote">``So
you have come to look at the Park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, and then stopped awkwardly. In the tone of each
there was an obscure constraint, and something in Mynors' smile of
salute to Beatrice showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>teachers</b></font>) too shared it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seen you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said to him (<font color='blue'><b>teachers</b></font>) familiarly, without taking his (<font color='blue'><b>teachers</b></font>)
hand; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) bent down and kissed Agnes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing here, mademoiselle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father's just down below, near the lake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) caught sight of you, and
sent me up to say that you were to be sure to come in to supper
to-night. You will, won't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, thanks. I had meant to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna knew that they were related, and also that Mynors was constantly
at the Suttons' house, but the close intimacy between these two came
nevertheless like a shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not conquer a certain
resentment of it, however absurd such a feeling might seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
intelligence. And this attitude extended not only to the intimacy, but
to Beatrice's handsome clothes and facile urbanity, which by contrast
emphasised her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) own poor little frock and tongue-tied manner. The mere
existence of Beatrice so near to Mynors was like an affront to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).
Yet at heart, and even while admiring this shining daughter of success,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was conscious within herself of a fundamental superiority. The
soul of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) condescended to the soul of the other one.

<p/>They began to discuss the Park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa says it will send up the value of that land over there
enormously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) ribboned sunshade to some
building plots which lay to the north, high up the hill. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Tellwright owns most of that, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) added to Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. It was torture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to refer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's possessions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it will be covered with streets in a few months. Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
build himself, or will he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) sell it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered, with an effort after gaiety
of tone, and then turned aside to look at the crowd. There, close
against the bandstand, stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, a short, stout, ruddy,
middle-aged man in a shabby brown suit. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), stared
fixedly, and nodded with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grotesque and ambiguous grin. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sidled off towards the entrance of the Park. None of the others had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Agnes dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said abruptly, `we must go now, or we
shall be late for tea.''

<p/>As the two women said good-bye their eyes met, and in the brief second
of that encounter each tried to wring from the other the true answer to
a question which lay unuttered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart. Then, having bidden adieu
to Mynors, whose parting glance sang its own song to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), Anna took
Agnes by the hand and left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Beatrice together.




<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>THE MISER``S DAUGHTER

<p/>Anna sat in the bay-window of the front parlour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) accustomed place
on Sunday evenings in summer, and watched Mr. Tellwright and Agnes
disappear down the slope of Trafalgar Road on their way to chapel.
Trafalgar Road is the long thoroughfare which, under many aliases, runs
through the Five Towns from end to end, uniting them as a river might
unite them. Ephraim Tellwright could remember the time when this part
of it was a country lane, flanked by meadows and market gardens. Now
it was a street of houses up to and beyond Bleakridge, where the
Tellwrights lived; on the other side of the hill the houses came only
in patches until the far-stretching borders of Hanbridge were reached.
Within the municipal limits Bleakridge was the pleasantest quarter of
Bursley--Hillport, abode of the highest fashion, had its own government
and authority--and to reside `at the top of Trafalgar Road' was still
the final ambition of many citizens, though the natural growth of the
town had robbed Bleakridge of some of that exclusive distinction which
it once possessed. Trafalgar Road, in its journey to Bleakridge from
the centre of the town, underwent certain changes of character. First
came a succession of manufactories and small shops; then, at the
beginning of the rise, a quarter of a mile of superior cottages; and
lastly, on the brow, occurred the houses of the comfortable-detached,
semi-detached, and in terraces, with rentals from 25_l._ to 60_l._ a
year. The Tellwrights lived in Manor Terrace -LRB-the name being a last
reminder of the great farmstead which formerly occupied the western
hill side-RRB-: their house, of light yellow brick, was two-storied, with a
long narrow garden behind, and the rent 30_l_. Exactly opposite was an
antique red mansion, standing back in its own ground--home of the
Mynors family for two generations, but now a school, the Mynors family
being extinct in the district save for one member. Somewhat higher up,
still on the opposite side to Manor Terrace, came an imposing row of
four new houses, said to be the best planned and best built in the
town, each erected separately and occupied by its owner. The nearest
of these four was Councillor Sutton's, valued at 60_l._ a year. Lower
down, below Manor Terrace and on the same side, lived the Wesleyan
superintendent minister, the vicar of St. Luke's Church, an alderman,
and a doctor.

<p/>It was nearly six o'clock. The sun shone, but gentlier; and the earth
lay cooling in the mild, pensive effulgence of a summer evening. Even
the onrush of the steam-car, as it swept with a gay load of passengers
to Hanbridge, seemed to be chastened; the bell of the Roman Catholic
chapel sounded like the bell of some village church heard in the
distance; the quick but sober tramp of the chapel-goers fell peacefully
on the ear. The sense of calm increased, and, steeped in this
meditative calm, Anna from the open window gazed idly down the
perspective of the road, which ended a mile away in the dim concave
forms of ovens suffused in a pale mist. A book from the Free Library
lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lap; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not read it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was conscious of nothing
save the quiet enchantment of reverie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind, stimulated by the
emotions of the afternoon, broke the fetters of habitual
self-discipline, and ranged voluptuously free over the whole field of
recollection and anticipation. To remember, to hope: that was
sufficient joy.

<p/>In the dissolving views of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own past, from which the rigour and pain
seemed to have mysteriously departed, the chief figure was always her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father--that sinister and formidable individuality, whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind hated
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart disobediently loved. Ephraim Tellwright-LSB-1-RSB- was one of
the most extraordinary and most mysterious men in the Five Towns. The
outer facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) career were known to all, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) riches made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
notorious; but of the secret and intimate man none knew anything except
Anna, and what little Anna knew had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) by divination rather
than discernment. A native of Hanbridge, he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) had inherited a small
fortune from his (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) father, who was a prominent Wesleyan Methodist. At
thirty, owing mainly to investments in property which his (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) calling of
potter's valuer had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) to choose with advantage, he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) was worth
twenty thousand pounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) lived in lodgings on a total expenditure
of about a hundred a year. When he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) was thirty-five he (<font color='blue'><b>native</b></font>) suddenly
married, without any perceptible public wooing, the daughter of a wood
merchant at Oldcastle, and shortly after the marriage his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) wife
inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father a sum of eighteen thousand pounds. The pair
lived narrowly in a small house up at Pireford, between Hanbridge and
Oldcastle. They visited no one, and were never seen together except on
Sundays. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a rosy-cheeked, very unassuming and simple woman, who
smiled easily and talked with difficulty, and for the rest lived
apparently a servile life of satisfaction and content. After five
years Anna was born, and in another five years Mrs. Tellwright died of
erysipelas. The widower engaged a housekeeper: otherwise his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) existence
proceeded without change. No stranger visited the house, the
housekeeper never gossiped; but tales will spread, and people fell into
the habit of regarding Tellwright's child and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) housekeeper with
commiseration.

<p/>During all this period he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was what is termed 'a good Wesleyan,''
preaching and teaching, and spending himself in the various activities
of Hanbridge chapel. For many years he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been circuit treasurer.
Among Anna's earliest memories was a picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father arriving
late for supper one Sunday night in autumn after an anniversary
service, and pouring out on the white tablecloth the contents of
numerous chamois-leather money-bags. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled the surprising
dexterity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) counted the coins, the peculiar smell of the
bags, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mother's bland exclamation, ``Eh, Ephraim!<div class="bookquote">'' Tellwright
belonged by birth to the Old Guard of Methodism; there was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
family a tradition of holy valour for the pure doctrine: his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) father, a
Bursley man, had fought in the fight which preceded the famous
Primitive Methodist Secession of 1808 at Bursley, and had also borne a
notable part in the Warren affrays of '28, and the disastrous trouble
of the Fly-Sheets in '49, when Methodism lost a hundred thousand
members. As for Ephraim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) expounded the mystery of the Atonement in
village conventicles and grew garrulous with God at prayer-meetings in
the big Bethesda chapel; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did these things as routine, without
skill and without enthusiasm, because they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) an unassailable
position within the central group of the society. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not, in fact,
much smitten with either the doctrinal or the spiritual side of
Methodism. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chief interest lay in those fiscal schemes of
organisation without whose aid no religious propaganda can possibly
succeed. It was in the finance of salvation that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose supreme--the
interminable alternation of debt-raising and new liability which
provides a lasting excitement for Nonconformists. In the negotiation
of mortgages, the artful arrangement of appeals, the planning of
anniversaries and of mighty revivals, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was an undisputed leader. To
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the circuit was a `going concern,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kept it in motion,
serving the Lord in committee and over statements of account. The
minister by his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) pleading might bring sinners to the penitent form, but
it was Ephraim Tellwright who reduced the cost per head of souls saved,
and so widened the frontiers of the Kingdom of Heaven.

<p/>Three years after the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) first wife it was rumoured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
would marry again, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) choice had fallen on a young orphan
girl, thirty years his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) junior, who `assisted' at the stationer's shop
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) daily newspaper. The rumour was well-founded.
Anna, then eight years of age, vividly remembered the home-coming of
the pale wife, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own sturdy attempts to explain, excuse, or
assuage to this wistful and fragile creature the implacable harshness
of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's temper. Agnes was born within a year, and the pale
girl died of puerperal fever. In that year lay a whole tragedy, which
could not have been more poignant in its perfection if the year had
been a thousand years. Ephraim promptly re-engaged the old
housekeeper, a course which filled Anna with secret childish revolt,
for Anna was now nine, and accomplished in all domesticity. In another
seven years the housekeeper died, a gaunt grey ruin, and Anna at
sixteen became mistress of the household, with a small sister to
cherish and control. About this time Anna began to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father was generally regarded as a man of great wealth, having few
rivals in the entire region of the Five Towns, Definite knowledge,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had none: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affairs; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew only
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) possessed houses and other property in various places, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
always turned first to the money article in the newspaper, and that
long envelopes arrived for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by post almost daily. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had once
heard the surmise that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was worth sixty thousand of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, apart
from the fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first wife, Anna's mother. Nevertheless, it
did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, in plain terms, as a
miser, until one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) happened to read in the ``Staffordshire Signal'
some particulars of the last will and testament of William Wilbraham,
J.P., who had just died. Mr. Wilbraham had been a famous magnate and
benefactor of the Five Towns; his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) revered name was in every mouth; he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>)
had a fine seat, Hillport House, at Hillport; and his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) superb horses
were constantly seen, winged and nervous, in the streets of Bursley and
Hanbridge. The ``Signal' said that the net value of his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) estate was
sworn at fifty-nine thousand pounds. This single fact added a definite
and startling significance to figures which had previously conveyed
nothing to Anna except an idea of vastness. The crude contrast between
the things of Hillport House and the things of the six-roomed abode in
Manor Terrace gave food for reflection, silent but profound.

<p/>Tellwright had long ago retired from business, and three years after
the housekeeper died he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) retired, practically, from religious work, to
the grave detriment of the Hanbridge circuit. In reply to sorrowful
questioners, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said merely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was getting old and needed rest,
and that there ought to be plenty of younger men to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
gave up everything except his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) pew in the chapel. The circuit was
astounded by this sudden defection of a class-leader, a local preacher,
and an officer. It was an inexplicable fall from grace. Yet the
solution of the problem was quite simple. Ephraim had lost interest in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) religious avocations; they had ceased to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>), the old ardour
had cooled. The phenomenon is a common enough experience with men who
have passed their fiftieth year--men, too, who began with the true and
sacred zeal, which Tellwright never felt. The difference in
Tellwright's case was that, characteristically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) at once yielded to
the new instinct, caring naught for public opinion. Soon afterwards,
having purchased a lot of cottage property in Bursley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) decided to
migrate to the town of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) fathers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had more than one reason for
doing so, but perhaps the chief was that he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) found the atmosphere of
Hanbridge Wesleyan chapel rather uncongenial. The exodus from it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) silent and malicious retort to a silent rebuke.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) appeared now to grow younger, discarding in some measure a certain
morose taciturnity which had hitherto marked his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) demeanour. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) went
amiably about in the manner of a veteran determined to enjoy the brief
existence of life's winter. His (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) stout, stiff, deliberate yet alert
figure became a familiar object to Bursley: that ruddy face, with its
small blue eyes, smooth upper lip, and short grey beard under the
smooth chin, seemed to pervade the streets, offering everywhere the
conundrum of its vague smile. Though no friend ever crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
doorstep, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had dozens of acquaintances of the footpath. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not,
however, a facile talker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seldom gave an opinion; nor were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
remarks often noticeably shrewd. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) existed within himself,
unrevealed. To the crowd, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a marvellous legend, and
moving always in the glory of that legend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) received their wondering
awe--an awe tinged with contempt for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lack of ostentation and public
splendour. Commercial men with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had transacted business liked
to discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) abilities, thus disseminating that solid respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
which had sprung from a personal experience of those abilities, and
which not even the shabbiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) clothes could weaken.

<p/>Anna was disturbed by the arrival at the front door of the milk-girl.
Alternately with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stayed at home on Sunday evenings,
partly to receive the evening milk and partly to guard the house. The
Persian cat with one ear preceded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to the door as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard
the clatter of the can. The stout little milk-girl dispensed one pint
of milk into Anna's jug, and spilt an eleemosynary supply on the step
for the cat. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does like it fresh, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div>said the milk-girl,
smiling at the greedy cat, and then, with a <div class="bookquote">``Lovely evenin'' (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div>,'' departed
down the street, one fat red arm stretched horizontally out to balance
the weight of the can in the other. Anna leaned idly against the
doorpost, waiting while the cat finished, until at length the swaying
figure of the milk-girl disappeared in the dip of the road. Suddenly
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) darted within, shutting the door, and stood on the hall-mat in a
startled attitude of dismay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had caught sight of Henry Mynors in
the distance, approaching the house. At that moment the kitchen clock
struck seven, and Mynors, according to the rule of a lifetime, should
have been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) place in the `orchestra' -LRB-or, as some term it, the
`singing-seat'-RRB- of the chapel, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was an admired baritone. Anna
dared not conjecture what impulse had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) into this extraordinary,
incredible deviation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared not conjecture, but despite herself
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, and the knowledge shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sensitive and peremptory
conscience. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart began to beat rapidly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in distress.
Aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father and sister had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone, did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mean to
call? It was absolutely impossible, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feared it, and blushed,
all solitary there in the passage, for shame. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sharp,
decided footsteps, and through the glazed panels of the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could
see the outline of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) form. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand was on the gate, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ceased to breathe. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pushed the gate open, and then, at the
whisper of some blessed angel, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) closed it again and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) way
up the street. After a few moments Anna carried the milk into the
kitchen, and stood by the dresser, moveless, each muscle braced in the
intensity of profound contemplation. Gradually the tears rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
eyes and fell; they were the tincture of a strange and mystic joy, too
poignant to be endured. As it were under compulsion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran outside,
and down the garden path to the low wall which looked over the grey
fields of the valley up to Hillport. Exactly opposite, a mile and a
half away, on the ridge, was Hillport Church, dark and clear against
the orange sky. To the right, and nearer, lay the central masses of
the town, tier on tier of richly-coloured ovens and chimneys. Along
the field-paths couples moved slowly. All was quiescent, languorous,
beautiful in the glow of the sun's stately declension. Anna put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
arms on the wall. Far more impressively than in the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
realised that this was the end of one epoch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) career and the
beginning of another. Enthralled by austere traditions and that stern
conscience of hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never permitted herself to dream of the
possibility of an escape from the parental servitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never
looked beyond the horizons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) present world, but had sought
spiritual satisfaction in the ideas of duty and sacrifice. The worst
tyrannies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father never dulled the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and,
without perhaps being aware of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had rather despised love and the
dalliance of the sexes. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attitude towards such things there had
been not only a little contempt but also some disapproval, as though
man were destined for higher ends. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw, in a quick revelation,
that it was the lovers, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), who had the right to scorn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
saw how miserably narrow, tepid, and trickling the stream of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life
had been, and had threatened to be. Now it gushed forth warm,
impetuous, and full, opening out new and delicious vistas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lived;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was finding the sight to see, the courage to enjoy. Now, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) leaned over the wall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would not have cared if Henry Mynors
indeed had called that night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived something splendid and
free in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) abandonment of habit and discretion at the bidding of a
desire. To be the magnet which could draw that pattern and exemplar of
seemliness from the strict orbit of virtuous custom! It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), the
miser's shabby daughter, who had caused this amazing phenomenon. The
thought intoxicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Without the support of the wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might
have fallen. In a sort of trance she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) murmured these words: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna Tellwright</b></font>)</div><p/>This was Anna Tellwright, the ascetic, the prosaic, the impassive.

<p/>After an interval which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was as much like a minute as a century,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) went back into the house. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) entered by the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) heard
an impatient knocking at the front door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At last,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) father grimly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) opened the door. In two
words he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) terrible sway over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>). Agnes looked timidly
from one to the other and slipped past them into the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in the garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna explained. <div class="bookquote">``Have you been here long?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
tried to smile apologetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only about a quarter of an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, with a grimness still
more portentous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't speak again to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought fearfully. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
mistaken. After he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had carefully hung his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best hat on the hat-rack, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and said, with a queer smile:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye've been day-dreaming, eh, Sis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>queer</b></font>)</div><p/>``Sis' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pet name, used often by Agnes, but by her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father only at
the very rarest intervals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was staggered at this change of front,
so unaccountable in this man, who, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had unwittingly annoyed
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was capable of keeping an awful silence for days together. What
did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know? What had those old eyes seen?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stammered, gathering herself together happily, <div class="bookquote">``I
forgot the time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that after all there was a bond between
them which nothing could break--the tie of blood. They were father and
daughter, united by sympathies obscure but fundamental. Kissing was
not in the Tellwright blood, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had a fleeting wish to hug the
tyrant.



<p/>-LSB-1-RSB- Tellwright: tile-wright, a name specially characteristic of, and
possibly originating in, this clay-manufacturing district.




<p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>THE BIRTHDAY

<p/>The next morning there was no outward sign that anything unusual had
occurred. As the clock in the kitchen struck eight Anna carried to the
back parlour a tray on which were a dish of bacon and a coffee-pot.
Breakfast was already laid for three. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) threw a housekeeper's glance
over the table, and called: <div class="bookquote">``Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>a housekeeper</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tellwright was re-setting
some encaustic tiles in the lobby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) came in, coatless, and, dropping
a trowel on the hearth, sat down at the end of the table nearest the
fireplace. Anna sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>), and poured out the coffee.

<p/>On the dish were six pieces of bacon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) put one piece on a plate, and
set it carefully in front of Agnes's vacant chair, two he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) passed to
Anna, three he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) kept for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Agnes?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Coming--she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)'s finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) arithmetic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In the middle of the table was an unaccustomed small jug containing
gilly-flowers. Mr. Tellwright noticed it instantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an we gotten here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said, indicating the jug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes gave me them first thing when she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) got up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)'s grown them
herself, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said, and then added: <div class="bookquote">``It's my birthday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) exclaimed, with a trace of satire in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Thou`rt a
woman now, lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No further remark on that matter was made during the meal.

<p/>Agnes ran in, all pinafore and legs. With a toss backwards of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
light golden hair she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) slipped silently into her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) seat, cautiously
glancing at the master of the house. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) began to stir her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) coffee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, young woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright said curtly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) looked a startled interrogative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We're waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, confused. ``I thought you'd said it. <div class="bookquote">``God sanctify
this food to our use and us to His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) service for Christ's sake, Amen.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>The breakfast proceeded in silence. Breakfast at eight, dinner at
noon, tea at four, supper at eight: all the meals in this house
occurred with absolute precision and sameness. Mr. Tellwright seldom
spoke, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) example imposed silence on the girls, who felt as nuns
feel when assisting at some grave but monotonous and perfunctory rite.
The room was not a cheerful one in the morning, since the window was
small and the aspect westerly. Besides the table and three horse-hair
chairs, the furniture consisted of an arm-chair, a bent-wood rocking
chair, and a sewing-machine. A fatigued Brussels carpet covered the
floor. Over the mantelpiece was an engraving of <div class="bookquote">``The Light of the
World,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a frame of polished brown wood. On the other walls were
some family photographs in black frames. A two-light chandelier hung
from the ceiling, weighed down on one side by a patent gas-saving
mantle and a glass shade; over this the ceiling was deeply discoloured.
On either side of the chimney-breast were cupboards about three feet
high; some cardboard boxes, a work-basket, and Agnes's school books lay
on the tops of these cupboards. On the window-sill was a pot of
mignonette in a saucer. The window was wide open, and flies buzzed to
and fro, constantly rebounding from the window panes with terrible
thuds. In the blue-paved yard beyond the cat was licking himself in
the sunlight with an air of being wholly absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) task.

<p/>Mr. Tellwright demanded a second and last cup of coffee, and having
drunk it pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) plate as a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had finished. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
took from the mantelpiece at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) right hand a bundle of letters and
opened them methodically. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had arranged the correspondence in a
flattened pile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) steel-rimmed spectacles and began to read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can I return thanks, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes asked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) nodded, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) fixedly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) spectacles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God for our good breakfast, Amen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div><p/>In two minutes the table was cleared, and Mr. Tellwright was alone. As
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) read laboriously through communications from solicitors, secretaries
of companies, and tenants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) daughters talking together
in the kitchen. Anna was washing the breakfast things while Agnes
wiped. Then there were flying steps across the yard: Agnes had gone to
school.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) correspondence, Mr. Tellwright took up the
trowel again and finished the tile-setting in the lobby. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) coat, and, gathering together the letters from the table in
the back parlour, went into the front parlour and shut the door. This
room was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) office. The principal things in it were an old oak bureau
and an old oak desk-chair which had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) first wife's
father; on the walls were some sombre landscapes in oil, received from
the same source; there was no carpet on the floor, and only one other
chair. A safe stood in the corner opposite the door. On the
mantelpiece were some books--Woodfall's <div class="bookquote">``Landlord and Tenant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)</div>Jordan's
<div class="bookquote">``Guide to Company Law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)</div>Whitaker's Almanack, and a Gazetteer of the
Five Towns. Several wire files, loaded with papers, hung from the
mantelpiece. With the exception of a mahogany what-not with a Bible on
it, which stood in front of the window, there was nothing else whatever
in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) sat down to the bureau and opened it, and took from
one of the pigeon-holes a packet of various documents: these he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)
examined one by one, from time to time referring to a list. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)
unlocked the safe and extracted from it another bundle of documents
which had evidently been placed ready. With these in his (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)
opened the door, and called out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Yes, father;' her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) voice came from the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a minute. I'm peeling potatoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) seated at the bureau as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) did
not look round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood there in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) print dress and white apron, full in the eye of
the sun, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not guess what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been
summoned for. As a rule, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father between breakfast
and dinner. At length he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) harsh, abrupt tones, and then stopped for a
moment before continuing. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thick, short fingers held the list which
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had previously been consulting. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waited in bewilderment. <div class="bookquote">``It's
your birthday, ye told me. I hadna' forgotten. Ye're of age to-day,
and there's summat for ye. Your mother had a fortune of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, and
under your grandfeyther's will it comes to you when you're twenty-one.
I'm the trustee. Your mother had eighteen thousand pounds i'
Government stock.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid a slight sneering emphasis on the last two
words. <div class="bookquote">``That was near twenty-five year ago. I've nigh on trebled it
for ye, what wi' good investments and interest accumulating. Thou`rt
worth'--here he (<font color='blue'><b>trustee</b></font>) changed to the second personal singular, a habit with
him (<font color='blue'><b>trustee</b></font>)--`thou`rt worth this day as near fifty thousand as makes no matter,
Anna. And that's a tidy bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fifty thousand--_pounds_!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) exclaimed aghast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tried to speak calmly. <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean it's mine, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's thine, under thy grandfeyther's will--haven't I told thee? I'm
bound by law for to give it to thee this day, and thou mun give me a
receipt in due form for the securities. Here they are, and here's the
list. Tak' the list, Anna, and read it to me while I check off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mechanically took the blue paper and read: <div class="bookquote">``Toft End Colliery and
Brickworks Limited, five hundred shares of ten pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They paid ten per cent. last year,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, `and with coal up as it
is they'll pay fiftane this. Let's see what thy arithmetic is worth,
lass. How much is fiftane per cent. on five thousand pun?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Seven hundred and fifty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) said, getting the correct answer
by a superhuman effort worthy of that occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Right,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father, pleased. <div class="bookquote">``Recollect that's more till two pun
a day. Go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``North Staffordshire Railway Company ordinary stock, ten thousand and
two hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Right. Th' owd North Stafford's getting up i' th' world. It'll be a
five per cent. line yet. Then thou mun sell out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had only a vague idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meaning, and continued: <div class="bookquote">``Five Towns
Waterworks Company Limited consolidated stock, eight thousand five
hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a tit-bit, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) interjected, looking absently over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
spectacles at something outside in the road. <div class="bookquote">``You canna' pick that up
on shardrucks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Norris's Brewery Limited, six hundred ordinary shares of ten pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty per cent.,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Twenty per cent. regular.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
made no attempt to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pride in these investments. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
the right to be proud of them. They were the finest in the market, the
aristocracy of investments, based on commercial enterprises of which
every business man in the Five Towns knew the entire soundness. They
conferred distinction on the possessor, like a great picture or a rare
volume. They stifled all questions and insinuations. Put before any
jury of the Five Towns as evidence of character, they would almost have
exculpated a murderer.

<p/>Anna continued reading the list, which seemed endless: long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had reached the last item her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brain was a menagerie of monstrous
figures. The list included, besides all sorts of shares English and
American, sundry properties in the Five Towns, and among these was the
earthenware manufactory in Edward Street occupied by Titus Price, the
Sunday-school superintendent. Anna was a little alarmed to find
herself the owner of this works; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father had had some
difficult moments with Titus Price, and that the property was not
without grave disadvantages.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright asked, at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Total face value,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) went on, `as I value it, forty-eight thousand
and fifty pounds, producing a net annual income of three thousand two
hundred and ninety pounds or thereabouts. There's not many in this
district as `as gotten that to their names, Anna--no, nor half
that--let 'em be who they will.''

<p/>Anna had sensations such as a child might have who has received a
traction-engine to play with in a back yard. <div class="bookquote">``What am I to do with
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked plaintively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do wi' it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) repeated, and stood up and faced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) lips
together: <div class="bookquote">``Do wi' it, did ye say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tak' care on it, my girl. Tak' care on it. And remember it's thine.
Thou mun sign this list, and all these transfers and fal-lals, and then
thou mun go to th' Bank, and tell Mester Lovatt I've sent thee.
There's four hundred pound there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tak</b></font>)'ll give thee a cheque-book. I've
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tak</b></font>) all about it. Thou'll have thy own account, and be sure thou
keeps it straight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't know a bit what to do, father, and so it's no use talking,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said quietly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll learn ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Here, tak' th' pen, and let's have thy
signature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) signed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) name many times and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) finger on many seals. Then
Tellwright gathered up everything into a bundle, and gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to
hold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the lot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said. ``Have ye gotten <div class="bookquote">``em?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/>They both smiled, self-consciously. As for Tellwright, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was
evidently impressed by the grandeur of this superb renunciation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
part. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I keep 'em for ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then give 'em me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) took back all the documents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When shall I call at the Bank, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better call this afternoon--afore three, mind ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. But I shan't know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've gotten a tongue in that noddle of yours, haven't ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Now go and get along wi' them potatoes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna returned to the kitchen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt no elation or ferment of any
kind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not begun to realise the significance of what had
occurred. Like the soldier whom a bullet has struck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) only knew
vaguely that something had occurred. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) peeled the potatoes with more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) usual thrifty care; the peel was so thin as to be almost
transparent. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not arrange or examine
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) emotions until after she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had met Henry Mynors again. More than
anything else she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>): it was as if out of the mere sight
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) something definite might emerge, as if when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes had rested
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), and not before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might perceive some simple solution of the
problems which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had obscurely discerned ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/>During dinner a boy brought a note for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read it,
snorted, and threw it across the table to Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, `that's your affair.''

<p/>The letter was from Titus Price: it said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) was sorry to be
compelled to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) promise, but it was quite impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) to
pay twenty pounds on account of rent that day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) would endeavour to
pay at least twenty pounds in a week's time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better call there, after you've been to th' Bank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said
Tellwright, `and get summat out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>), if it's only ten pun.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Must I go to Edward Street?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to say? I've never been there before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's high time as ye began to look after your own property. You
mun see owd Price, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) ye canna accept any excuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much does he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) owe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>) owes ye a hundred and twenty-five pun altogether--he (<font color='blue'><b>Street</b></font>)'s five
quarters in arrear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred and--! Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna was aghast. The sum
appeared larger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) than all the thousands and tens of thousands
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had received in the morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reflected that the weekly
bills of the household amounted to about a sovereign, and that the
total of this debt of Price's would therefore keep them in food for two
years. The idea of being in debt was abhorrent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not
conceive how a man who was in debt could sleep at nights. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Price
ought to be ashamed of himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said warmly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)'s quite
able to pay.''  (<font color='red'><b>the superintendent</b></font>)</div>The image of the sleek and stout superintendent of the
Sunday-school, arrayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) rich, almost voluptuous, broadcloth,
offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) profoundly. That he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), debtor and promise-breaker, should
have the effrontery to pray for the souls of children, to chastise
their petty furtive crimes, was nearly incredible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Price is all _right_,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father remarked, with an apparent
benignity which surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)'ll pay when he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it's a shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated emphatically.

<p/>Agnes looked with a mystified air from one to the other, instinctively
divining that something very extraordinary had happened during her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
absence at school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye mun`na be too hard, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright. <div class="bookquote">``Supposing ye sold owd
Titus up? What then? D'ye reckon ye'd get a tenant for them
ramshackle works? A thousand pound spent wouldn't `tice a tenant.
That Edward Street property was one o' ye grandfeyther's specs; `twere
none o' mine. You'd best tak' what ye can get.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna felt a little ashamed of herself, not because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bad policy,
but because she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that Mr. Price might have been handicapped by the
faults of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) property.

<p/>That afternoon it was a shy and timid Anna who swung back the heavy
polished and glazed portals of the Bursley branch of the Birmingham,
Sheffield and district Bank, the opulent and spacious erection which
stands commandingly at the top of St. Luke's Square. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), across broad counters, enormous ledgers, and rows of bent heads,
and wondered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should address. Then a bearded gentleman, who
was weighing gold in a balance, caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) slid the gold
into a drawer, and whisked round the end of the counter with a celerity
which was, at any rate, not born of practice, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), the cashier, had
not done such a thing for years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon, Miss Tellwright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Good afternoon. I--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I trouble you to step into the manager's room?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>cashier</b></font>)
forward, while every clerk's eye watched. Anna tried not to blush, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could feel the red mounting even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) temples.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Delightful weather we're having. But of course we've the right to
expect it at this time of year.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opened a door on the glass of
which was painted <div class="bookquote">``Manager,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and bowed. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lovatt--Miss Tellwright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lovatt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lovatt greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) new customer with a formal and rather fatigued
politeness, and invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to sit in a large leather armchair in front
of a large table; on this table lay a large open book. Anna had once
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life been to the dentist's; this interview reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of that
experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father told me I might expect you to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lovatt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lovatt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>)
high-pitched, perfunctory tones. Richard Lovatt was probably the most
influential man in Bursley. Every Saturday morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) irrigated the
whole town with fertilising gold. By a single negative he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) could have
ruined scores of upright merchants and manufacturers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) had only to
stop a man in the street and murmur, <div class="bookquote">``By the way, your overdraft--,''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>in order to spread discord and desolation through a refined and pious
home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) estimate of human nature was falsified by no common
illusions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) had the impassive and frosty gaze of a criminal judge.
Many men deemed they had cause to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>), but no one did hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>):
all recognised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) was set far above hatred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kindly sign your full name here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) said, pointing to a spot on the
large open page of the book, `and your ordinary signature, which you
will attach to cheques, here.''

<p/>Anna wrote, but in doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) became aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no ordinary
signature; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was obliged to invent one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to draw anything out now? There is already a credit of
four hundred and twenty pounds in your favour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lovatt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lovatt, after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) had handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a cheque-book, a deposit-book, and a pass-book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered quickly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) keenly desired some
money, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) well knew that courage would fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to demand it
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's consent; moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was in a whirl of
uncertainty as to the uses of the three books, though Mr. Lovatt had
expounded them severally to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in simple language.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-day, Miss Tellwright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My compliments to your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lovatt</b></font>) final glance said half cynically, half in pity: <div class="bookquote">``You are naïve and
unspoilt now, but these eyes will see yours harden like the rest.
Wretched victim of gold, you are only one in a procession, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Outside, Anna thought that everyone had been very agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) complacency increased at a bound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) no longer felt ashamed of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shabby cotton dress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) surmised that people would find it
convenient to ignore any difference which might exist between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
costume and that of other girls.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on to Edward Street, a short steep thoroughfare at the eastern
extremity of the town, leading into a rough road across unoccupied land
dotted with the mouths of abandoned pits: this road climbed up to Toft
End, a mean annexe of the town about half a mile east of Bleakridge.
From Toft End, lying on the highest hill in the district, one had a
panoramic view of Hanbridge and Bursley, with Hillport to the west, and
all the moorland and mining villages to the north and north-east.
Titus Price and his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) son lived in what had once been a farm-house at
Toft End; every morning and evening they traversed the desolate and
featureless grey road between their dwelling and the works.

<p/>Anna had never been in Edward Street before. It was a miserable
quarter--two rows of blackened infinitesimal cottages, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
manufactory at the end--a frontier post of the town. Price's works was
small, old-fashioned, and out of repair--one of those properties which
are forlorn from the beginning, which bring despair into the hearts of
a succession of owners, and which, being ultimately deserted, seem to
stand for ever in pitiable ruin. The arched entrance for carts into
the yard was at the top of the steepest rise of the street, when it
might as well have been at the bottom; and this was but one example of
the architect's fine disregard for the principle of economy in
working--that principle to which in the scheming of manufactories
everything else is now so strictly subordinated. Ephraim Tellwright
used to say -LRB-but not to Titus Price-RRB- that the situation of that archway
cost five pounds a year in horseflesh, and that five pounds was the
interest on a hundred. The place was badly located, badly planned and
badly constructed. Its faults defied improvement. Titus Price
remained in it only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) was chained there by arrears of rent;
Tellwright hesitated to sell it only because the rent was a hundred a
year, and the whole freehold would not have fetched eight hundred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
promised repairs in exchange for payment of arrears which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) knew would
never be paid, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) policy was to squeeze the last penny out of
Price without forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) into bankruptcy. Such was the predicament
when Anna assumed ownership. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) surveyed the irregular and huddled
frontage from the opposite side of the street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first feeling was
one of depression at the broken and dirty panes of the windows. A man
in shirt-sleeves was standing on the weighing platform under the
archway; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could see the smoke issuing
in puffs from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) crossed the road. Hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) footfalls,
the man turned round: it was Titus Price himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) was wearing an
apron, but no cap; the sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) shirt were rolled up, exposing
forearms covered with auburn hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) puffed, heavy face, and general
bigness and untidiness, gave the idea of a vast and torpid male
slattern. Anna was astounded by the contrast between the Titus of
Sunday and the Titus of Monday: a single glance compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to
readjust all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) notions of the man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stammered a greeting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
replied, and then they were both silent for a moment: in the pause Mr.
Price thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) pipe between apron and waistcoat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come inside, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said, with a sickly, conciliatory
smile. <div class="bookquote">``Come into the office, will ye?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) without a word through the archway. To the right was
an open door into the packing-house, where a man surrounded by straw
was packing basins in a crate: with swift, precise movements, twisting
straw between basin and basin, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forced piles of ware into a space
inconceivably small. Mr. Price lingered to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) for a few
seconds, and passed on. They were in the yard, a small quadrangle
paved with black, greasy mud. In one corner a load of coal had been
cast; in another lay a heap of broken saggars. Decrepit doorways led
to the various `shops' on the ground floor; those on the upper floor
were reached by narrow wooden stairs, which seemed to cling insecurely
to the exterior walls. Up one of these stairways Mr. Price climbed
with heavy, elephantine movements: Anna prudently waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had
reached the top before beginning to ascend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) pushed open a flimsy
door, and with a nod bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) enter. The office was a long narrow
room, the dirtiest that Anna had ever seen. If such was the condition
of the master's quarters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, what must the workshops be like?
The ceiling, which bulged downwards, was as black as the floor, which
sank away in the middle till it was hollow like a saucer. The
revolution of an engine somewhere below shook everything with a
periodic muffled thud. A greyish light came through one small window.
By the window was a large double desk, with chairs facing each other.
One of these chairs was occupied by Willie Price. The youth did not
observe at first that another person had come in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
was casting up figures in an account book, and murmuring numbers to
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) wore an office coat, short at the wrists and torn at the
elbows, and a battered felt hat was thrust far back over his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) head so
that the brim rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) dirty collar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) turned round at length,
and, on seeing Anna, blushed brilliant crimson, and rose, scraping the
legs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) chair horribly across the floor. Tall, thin, and ungainly
in every motion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had the look of a ninny: it was the fact that at
school all the boys by a common instinct had combined to tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), and
that on the works the young paintresses continually made private sport
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>). Anna, however, had not the least impulse to mock him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
thoughts. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) there was nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) blue eyes but simplicity
and good intentions. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt old, sagacious, crafty: it
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that some one ought to shield that transparent and
confiding soul from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father and the intriguing world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hat, holding it afterwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) great
bony hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get down to th' entry, Will,''  (<font color='red'><b>father Willie</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father, and Willie, with an
apologetic sort of cough, slipped silently away through the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Price</b></font>)</div>said old Price, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took the Windsor
chair that had been occupied by Willie. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tenant fell into the seat
opposite--a leathern chair from which the stuffing had exuded, and with
one of its arms broken. <div class="bookquote">``I hear as ye father is going into partnership
with young Mynors--Henry Mynors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna started at this surprising item of news, which was entirely fresh
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Father has said nothing to me about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) replied, coldly.

<p/>``Oh! Happen I've said too much. If so, you'll excuse me, Miss.. A
smart fellow, Mynors. Now you should see _his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)_ little works: not very
much bigger than this, but there's everything you can think of
there--all the latest machinery and dodges, and not over-rented, I'm
told. The biggest fool i' Bursley couldn't help but make money there.
This `ere works `ere, Miss Tellwright, wants mendin' with a new <div class="bookquote">``un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks very dirty, I must say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dirty!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) laughed--a short, acrid laugh--<div class="bookquote">``I suppose you've called
about the rent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father asked me to call.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see, this place belongs to you i' your own right, doesn't it,
Miss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``It's mine--from my grandfather, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Well, I'm sorry for to tell ye as I can't pay anything now--no,
not a cent. But I'll pay twenty pounds in a week. Tell ye father I'll
pay twenty pound in a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what you said last week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna remarked, with more brusqueness
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had intended. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was fearful at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own temerity in
thus addressing a superintendent of the Sunday-school; then, as nothing
happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt reassured, and strong in the justice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) position.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) admitted obsequiously. <div class="bookquote">``But I've been disappointed. One of
our best customers put us off, to tell ye the truth. Money's tight,
very tight. It's got to be give and take in these days, as ye father
knows. And I may as well speak plain to ye, Miss Tellwright. We
canna' stay here; we shall be compelled to give ye notice. What's
amiss with this bank-LSB-1-RSB- is that it wants pullin' down.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) went off
into a rapid enumeration of ninety-and-nine alterations and repairs
that must be done without the loss of a moment, and concluded: <div class="bookquote">``You
tell ye father what I've told ye, and say as I'll send up twenty pounds
next week. I can't pay anything now; I've nothing by me at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father said particularly I was to be sure and get something on
account.''  (<font color='red'><b>Titus</b></font>)</div>There was a flinty hardness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tone which astonished
herself perhaps more than Titus Price. A long pause followed, and then
Mr. Price drew a breath, seeming to nerve himself to a tremendous
sacrificial deed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell ye what I'll do. I'll give ye ten pounds now, and I'll do what
I can next week. I'll do what I can. There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) success.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) unlocked the desk, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) head disappeared under the lifted lid.
Anna gazed through the window. Like many women, and not a few men, in
the Five Towns, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was wholly ignorant of the staple manufacture. The
interior of a works was almost as strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as it would have been
to a farm-hand from Sussex. A girl came out of a door on the opposite
side of the quadrangle: the creature was clothed in clayey rags, and
carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) right shoulder a board laden with biscuit-LSB-2-RSB- cups. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
began to mount one of the wooden stairways, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so the
board, six feet in length, swayed alarmingly to and fro. Anna expected
to see it fall with a destructive crash, but the girl went up in
safety, and with a nonchalant jerk of the shoulder aimed the end of the
board through another door and vanished from sight. To Anna it was a
thrilling feat, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) noticed that a man who stood in the yard did
not even turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to watch it. Mr. Price recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to the
business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) errand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's two fives,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said, shutting down the desk with the sigh of a
crocodile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Liar! You said you had nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) unspoken thought ran, and at the
same instant the Sunday-school and everything connected with it
grievously sank in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) estimation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) contrasted this scene with that
on the previous day with the peccant schoolgirl: it was an hour of
disillusion. Taking the notes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave a receipt and rose to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell ye father'--it seemed to Anna that this phrase was always on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
lips--`tell ye father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must come down and look at the state this
place is in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Price, enheartened by the heroic payment of ten
pounds. Anna said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought a fire would do more good than
anything else to the foul, squalid buildings: the passing fancy
coincided with Mr. Price's secret and most intense desire.

<p/>Outside she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw Willie Price superintending the lifting of a crate on
to a railway lorry. After twirling in the air, the crate sank safely
into the waggon. Young Price was perspiring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Warm afternoon, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) pleasant bashful smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gave an affirmative. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) came to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), still smiling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) face full of an intention to say something,
however insignificant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you'll be at the Special Teachers' Meeting to-morrow night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. That was all: William had achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
small-talk: they parted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So father and Mr. Mynors are going into partnership,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kept saying
to herself on the way home.

<p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>A VISIT

<p/>The Special Teachers' Meeting to which Willie Price had referred was
one of the final preliminaries to a Revival--that is, a revival of
godliness and Christian grace--about to be undertaken by the Wesleyan
Methodist Society in Bursley. Its object was to arrange for a personal
visitation of the parents of Sunday-school scholars in their homes.
Hitherto Anna had felt but little interest in the Revival: it had
several times been brought indirectly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) notice, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
regarded it as a phenomenon which recurred at intervals in the cycle of
religious activity, and as not in any way affecting herself. The
gradual centring of public interest, however--that mysterious movement
which, defying analysis, gathers force as it proceeds, and ends by
coercing the most indifferent--had already modified her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attitude
towards this forthcoming event. It got about that the preacher who had
been engaged, a specialist in revivals, was a man of miraculous powers:
the number of souls which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had snatched from eternal torment was
precisely stated, and it amounted to tens of thousands. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) played the
cornet to the glory of God, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cornet was of silver: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) more
distant past had been ineffably wicked, and the faint rumour of that
dead wickedness clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) name like a piquant odour. As Anna walked
up Trafalgar Road from Price's she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) observed that the hoardings had been
billed with great posters announcing the Revival and the revivalist,
who was to commence his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) work on Friday night.

<p/>During tea Mr. Tellwright interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) perusal of the evening
``Signal' to give utterance to a rather remarkable speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless us!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Th' old trumpeter 'll turn the town upside down!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean the revivalist, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s a beautiful man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes exclaimed with enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``Our teacher
showed us his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) portrait after school this afternoon. I never saw such a
beautiful man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father gazed hard at the child for an instant, cup in hand, and
then turned to Anna with a slightly sardonic air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing i' this Revival, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Only there's a teachers' meeting about it
to-morrow night, and I have to go to that. Young Mr. Price mentioned
it to me specially to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A pause followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didst get anything out o' Price?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) gave me ten pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) wants you to go and look over the
works--says they're falling to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cheque, I reckon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) corrected the surmise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better give me them notes, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said after tea. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to
th' Bank i' th' morning, and I'll pay 'em in to your account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should not have suggested the propriety of
keeping at least one of the notes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) private use. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared
not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never any money of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own, not a penny; and the
effective possession of five pounds seemed far too audacious a dream.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hesitated to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's reply to such a request, even to
frame the request to herself. The thing, viewed close, was utterly
impossible. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relinquished the notes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) also, without
being asked, gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheque-book, deposit-book, and pass-book. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
did this while ardently desiring to refrain from doing it, as it were
under the compulsion of an invincible instinct. Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt
more at ease, as though some disturbing question had been settled once
and for all.

<p/>During the whole of that evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) timorously expected Mynors, saying
to herself however that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) certainly would not call before Thursday.
On Tuesday evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) started early for the teachers' meeting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
intention was to arrive among the first and to choose a seat in
obscurity, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew well that every eye would be upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was divided between the desire to see Mynors and the desire to avoid
the ordeal of being seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) colleagues in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) presence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
trembled lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should be incapable of commanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mien so as to
appear unconscious of this inspection by curious eyes.

<p/>The meeting was held in a large class-room, furnished with wooden
seats, a chair and a small table. On the grey distempered walls hung a
few Biblical cartoons depicting scenes in the life of Joseph and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
brethren--but without reference to Potiphar's wife. From the
whitewashed ceiling depended a T-shaped gas-fitting, one burner of
which showed a glimmer, though the sun had not yet set. The evening
was oppressively warm, and through the wide-open window came the faint
effluvium of populous cottages and the distant but raucous cries of
children at play. When Anna entered a group of young men were talking
eagerly round the table; among these was Willie Price, who greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).
No others had come: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down in a corner by the door, invisible
except from within the room. Gradually the place began to fill. Then
at last Mynors entered: Anna recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) authoritative step before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) walked quickly to the chair in front of the table,
and, including all in a friendly and generous smile, said that in the
absence of Mr. Titus Price it fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) to take the chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was
glad that so many had made a point of being present. Everyone sat
down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) gave out a hymn, and led the singing himself, attacking the
first note with an assurance born of practice. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) prayed, and as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) prayed Anna gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) intently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was standing up, the ends of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) fingers pressed against the top of the table. Very carefully
dressed as usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) wore a brilliant new red necktie, and a gardenia
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) button-hole. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) seemed happy, wholesome, earnest, and
unaffected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had the elasticity of youth with the firm wisdom of
age. And it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had never been younger and would never grow
older, remaining always at just thirty and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) prime. Incomparable
to the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was clearly born to lead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) functions
with tact, grace, and dignity. In such an affair as this present he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
disclosed the attributes of the skilled workman, whose easy and exact
movements are a joy and wonder to the beholder. And behind all was the
man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellent and strong nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kindliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sincerity.
Yes, to Anna, Mynors was perfect that night; the reality of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dreamy meditations. Fearful on the brink of an ecstatic
bliss, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could scarcely believe that from the enticements of a
thousand women this paragon had been preserved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Like most of
us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lacked the high courage to grasp happiness boldly and without
apprehension; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not learnt that nothing is too good to be true.

<p/>Mynors' prayer was a cogent appeal for the success of the Revival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) wanted, and confidently asked for it, approaching God with
humility but with self-respect. The prayer was punctuated by Amens
from various parts of the room. The atmosphere became suddenly
fervent, emotional and devout. Here was lofty endeavour, idealism, a
burning spirituality; and not all the pettinesses unavoidable in such
an organisation as a Sunday-school could hide the difference between
this impassioned altruism and the ignoble selfishness of the worldly.
Anna felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had often felt before, but more acutely now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
existed only on the fringe of the Methodist society. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not been
converted; technically she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was a lost creature: the converted knew it,
and in some subtle way their bearing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and others in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
case, always showed that they knew it. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) teach? Not from
the impulse of religious zeal. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) allowed to have charge of a
class of immortal souls? The blind could not lead the blind, nor the
lost save the lost. These considerations troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Conscience
pricked, accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of a continual pretence. The _rôle_ of
professing Christian, through false shame, had seemed distasteful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could never stand up and say, <div class="bookquote">``I am for
Christ,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>without being uncomfortable. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
inability to profess Christ. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could conceive herself proud and
happy in the very part which formerly she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had despised. It was these
believers, workers, exhorters, wrestlers with Satan, who had the right
to disdain; not she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). At that moment, as if divining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts,
Mynors prayed for those among them who were not converted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
blushed, and when the prayer was finished she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feared lest every eye
might seek hers in inquiry; but no one seemed to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/>Mynors sat down, and, seated, began to explain the arrangements for the
Revival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) made it plain that prayers without industry would not
achieve success. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) remarks revealed the fact that underneath the
broad religious structure of the enterprise, and supporting it, there
was a basis of individual diplomacy and solicitation. The town had
been mapped out into districts, and each of these was being importuned,
as at an election: by the thoroughness and instancy of this canvass,
quite as much as by the intensity of prayerful desire, would Christ
conquer. The affair was a campaign before it was a prostration at the
Throne of Grace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) spoke of the children, saying that in connection
with these they, the teachers, had at once the highest privilege and
the most sacred responsibility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) told of a special service for the
children, and the need of visiting them in their homes and inviting the
parents also to this feast of God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wished every teacher during
to-morrow and the next day and the next day to go through the list of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) scholars' names, and call if possible at every house. There
must be no shirking. <div class="bookquote">``Will you ladies do that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) exclaimed with an
appealing, serious smile. ``Will you, Miss Dickinson? Will you, Miss
Machin? Will you, Mrs. Salt? Will you, Miss Sutton? Will you--'
Until at last it came: ``Will you, Miss Tellwright?'' ``I will,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>)
answered, with averted eyes. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Thank you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Some others</b></font>)</div><p/>Some others spoke, hopefully, enthusiastically, and one or two prayed.
Then Mynors rose: <div class="bookquote">``May the blessing of God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost rest upon us now and for ever.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone ejaculated.
The meeting was over.

<p/>Anna passed rapidly out of he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) door, down the Quadrangle, and into
Trafalgar Road. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was the first to leave, daring not to stay in the
room a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not altered since Sunday;
there was no disillusion, but a deepening of the original impression.
Caught up by the soaring of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spirit, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spirit lifted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
conscious of vague but intense longing skyward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not reason
or think in that dizzying hour, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) made resolutions which had no
verbal form, yielding eagerly to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) influence and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) appeal. Not
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had reached the bottom of Duck Bank and was breasting the
first rise towards Bleakridge did her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pace slacken. Then a voice
called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recognised it, and turned sharply
beneath the shock. Mynors raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) hat and greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming to see your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a very satisfactory meeting to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) began, and in a
moment they were talking seriously of the Revival. With the most
oblique delicacy, the most perfect assumption of equality between them,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to perceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) genuine and profound anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
spiritual welfare. The atmosphere of the meeting was still round about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), the divine fire still uncooled. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you will come to the
first service on Friday night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. I shall come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I particularly wanted your promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They were at the door of the house. Agnes, obviously expectant and
excited, answered the bell. With an effort Anna and Mynors passed into
a lighter mood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father said you were coming, Mr. Mynors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, and, turning to
Anna, <div class="bookquote">``I've set supper all myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Capital! You must let me give you a
kiss for that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) bent down and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) with no reluctance. Anna looked on, smiling.

<p/>Mr. Tellwright sat near the window of the back parlour, reading the
paper. Twilight was at hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) head as Mynors entered
with Agnes in train, so as to see over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) spectacles, which were
half-way down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, Mr. Mynors? I was just going to begin my supper. I
don't wait, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) glanced at the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, `so long as you wouldn't eat it all. Would
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) have eaten it all, Agnes, do you think?'' Agnes pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) head
against Mynors' arm and laughed shyly. The old man sardonically
chuckled.

<p/>Anna, who was still in the passage, wondered what could be on the
table. If it was only the usual morsel of cheese she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
should expire of mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) peeped: the cheese was at one end,
and at the other a joint of beef, scarcely touched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had been engaged some seconds
upon the joke, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have saved ye the bone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna went upstairs to take off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat, and immediately Agnes flew
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>). The child was breathless with news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anna! As soon as you'd gone out father told me that Mr. Mynors
was coming for supper. Did you know before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till Mr. Mynors told me, dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>It was characteristic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
father to say nothing until the last moment.

<p/>``Yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) told me to put an extra plate, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) if I had
better put the beef on the table, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said ``No,<div class="bookquote">'' cross--you
know--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said I could please myself, so I put it on. Why has
Mr. Mynors come, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I know? Some business between him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) and father, I expect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very _queer_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes positively, with the child's aptitude
for looking a fact squarely in the face.

<p/>``Why <div class="bookquote">``queer'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know it is, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) frowned, and then breaking into a joyous
anile: <div class="bookquote">``But isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) nice? I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s lovely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna assented coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes persisted.

<p/>Anna brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair and determined not to put on the apron which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
usually wore in the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I tidy, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Run downstairs now. I am coming directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to wait for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes pouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>They entered the parlour together, and Henry Mynors jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
chair, and would not sit at table until they were seated. Then Mr.
Tellwright carved the beef, giving each of them a very small piece, and
taking only cheese for himself. Agnes handed the water-jug and the
bread. Mynors talked about nothing in especial, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) talked and
laughed the whole time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) even made the old man laugh, by a comical
phrase aimed at Agnes's mad passion for gilly-flowers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) seemed not
to have detected any shortcomings in the table appointments--the coarse
cloth and plates, the chipped tumblers, the pewter cruet, and the
stumpy knives--which caused anguish in the heart of the housewife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
might have sat at such a table every night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I trouble you for a little more beef?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) asked presently, and
Anna fancied a shade of mischief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) thus forced the old
man into a tardy hospitality. <div class="bookquote">``Thanks. _And_ a morsel of fat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was worth fifty thousand
pounds, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father worth perhaps more.

<p/>But on the whole Anna enjoyed the meal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sorry when they had
finished and Agnes had thanked God for the beef. It was not without
considerable reluctance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) rose and left the side of the man
whose arm she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) could have touched at any time during the previous twenty
minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had felt happy and perturbed in being so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so
intimate and free; already she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face by heart. The two girls
carried the plates and dishes into the kitchen, Agnes making the last
journey with the tablecloth, which Mynors had assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) to fold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut the door, Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, getting up to light the gas.
It was an order of dismissal to both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughters. <div class="bookquote">``Let me light
that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors exclaimed, and the gas was lighted before Mr. Tellwright
had struck a match. Mynors turned on the full force of gas. Then Mr.
Tellwright carefully lowered it. The summer quarter's gas-bill at that
house did not exceed five shillings.

<p/>Through the open windows of the kitchen and parlour, Anna could hear
the voices of the two men in conversation, Mynors' vivacious and
changeful, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's monotonous, curt, and heavy. Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) caught
the old man's hard dry chuckle. The washing-up was done, Agnes had
accomplished her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) home-lessons; the grandfather's clock chimed the
half-hour after nine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go to bed, Agnes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mustn't I say good-night to him (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I will say good-night for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't forget to. I shall ask you in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The regular sound of talk still came from the parlour. A full moon
passed along the cloudless sky. By its light and that of a glimmer of
gas, Anna sat cleaning silver, or rather nickel, at the kitchen table.
The spoons and forks were already clean, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt compelled to busy
herself with something. At length the talk stopped and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard the
scraping of chair-legs. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) return to the parlour? Or should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)--? Even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hesitated, the kitchen door opened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me coming in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to say good-night
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sprang up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) feel the agitation of
that hand?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Agnes wished me to say good-night to you for her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) smiled; till then his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) face had been serious. <div class="bookquote">``You won't
forget Friday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) murmured after he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had gone.




<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>THE REVIVAL

<p/>Anna spent the two following afternoons in visiting the houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
school-children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no talent for such work, which demands the
vocal rather than the meditative temperament, and the apparent futility
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) labours would have disgusted and disheartened her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) not
been sustained and urged forward by the still active influence of
Mynors and the teachers' meeting. There were fifteen names in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
class-book, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to each house, except four whose tenants were
impeccable Wesleyan families and would have considered themselves
insulted by a quasi-didactic visit from an upstart like Anna. Of the
eleven, some parents were rude to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); others begged, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
nothing to give; others made perfunctory promises; only two seemed to
regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as anything but a somewhat tiresome impertinence. The fault
was doubtless her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found joy in the uncongenial
and ill-performed task--the cold, fierce joy of the nun in her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) penance.
When it was done she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I have done it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as one who has sworn to do
it come what might, yet without quite expecting to succeed.

<p/>On the Friday afternoon, during tea, a boy brought up a large foolscap
packet addressed to Mr. Tellwright. <div class="bookquote">``From Mr. Mynors,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy said.
Tellwright opened it leisurely after the boy had gone, and took out
some sheets covered with figures which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) carefully examined. <div class="bookquote">``Anna,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was clearing away the tea things, <div class="bookquote">``I understand thou`rt
going to the Revival meeting to-night. I shall have a message as thou
mun give to Mr. Mynors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) went upstairs to dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) saw the Suttons' landau standing
outside their house on the opposite side of the road. Mrs. Sutton came
down the front steps and got into the carriage, and was followed by a
little restless, nervous, alert man who carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand a black
case of peculiar form. <div class="bookquote">``The Revivalist!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna exclaimed, remembering
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to stay with the Suttons during the Revival week. Then
this was the renowned crusader, and the case held his (<font color='blue'><b>crusader</b></font>) renowned cornet!
The carriage drove off down Trafalgar Road, and Anna could see that the
little man was talking vehemently and incessantly to Mrs. Sutton, who
listened with evident interest; at the same time the man's eyes were
everywhere, absorbing all details of the street and houses with
unquenchable curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the message for Mr. Mynors, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) asked in the parlour,
putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) cotton gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, and then paused. <div class="bookquote">``Shut th' door, lass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) shut it, not knowing what this cautiousness foreshadowed. Agnes
was in the kitchen.

<p/>``It's o' this``n,'' Tellwright began. <div class="bookquote">``Young Mynors wants a partner wi'
a couple o' thousand pounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) come to me. Ye understand; `tis
what they call a sleeping partner he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s after. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'ll give a third share
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) concern for two thousand pound now. I've looked into it and
there's money in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s no fool and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s gotten hold of a good
thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) sent me up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) stock-taking and balance sheet to-day, and
I've been o'er the place mysen. I'm telling thee this, lass, because I
have na' two thousand o' my own idle just now, and I thought as thou
might happen like th' investment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But father--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen. I know as there's only four hundred o' thine in th' Bank now,
but next week 'll see the beginning o' July and dividends coming in.
I've reckoned as ye'll have nigh on fourteen hundred i' dividends and
interests, and I can lend ye a couple o' hundred in case o' necessity.
It's a rare chance; thou's best tak' it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if you think it's all right, father, that's enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
said without animation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am' na I telling thee I think it's all right?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remarked sharply.
<div class="bookquote">``You mun tell Mynors as I say it's satisfactory. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) that, see?
I say it's satisfactory. I shall want for to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) later on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) couldna' come up any night next week, so ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to make it
the week after. There's no hurry. Dunna' forget.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>What surprised Anna most in the affair was that Henry Mynors should
have been able to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father into a speculation. Ephraim
Tellwright the investor was usually as shy as a well-fed trout, and
this capture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) by a youngster only two years established in
business might fairly be regarded as a prodigious feat. It was indeed
the highest distinction of Mynors' commercial career. Henry was so
prominently active in the Wesleyan Society that the members of that
society, especially the women, were apt to ignore the other side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
individuality. They knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) supreme as a religious worker; they did
not realise the likelihood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) becoming supreme in the staple
manufacture. Left an orphan at seventeen, Mynors belonged to a family
now otherwise extinct in the Five Towns--one of those families which by
virtue of numbers, variety, and personal force seem to permeate a whole
district, to be a calculable item of it, an essential part of its
identity. The elders of the Mynors blood had once occupied the red
house opposite Tellwright's, now used as a school, and had there reared
many children: the school building was still known as ``Mynors's' by
old-fashioned people. Then the parents died in middle age: one
daughter married in the North, another in the South; a third went to
China as a missionary and died of fever; the eldest son died; the
second had vanished into Canada and was reported a scapegrace; the
third was a sea-captain. Henry -LRB-the youngest-RRB- alone was left, and of
all the family Henry was the only one to be connected with the
earthenware trade. There was no inherited money, and during ten years
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had worked for a large firm in Turnhill, as clerk, as traveller, and
last as manager, living always quietly in lodgings. In the fullness of
time he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) gave notice to leave, was offered a partnership, and refused
it. Taking a newly erected manufactory in Bursley near the canal, he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)
started in business for himself, and it became known that, at the age
of twenty-eight, he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) had saved fifteen hundred pounds. Equally expert
in the labyrinths of manufacture and in the niceties of the markets -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)
was reckoned a peerless traveller-RRB-, Mynors inevitably flourished. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
order-books were filled and flowing over at remunerative prices, and
insufficiency of capital was the sole peril to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was exposed.
By the raising of a finger he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) could have had a dozen working and
moneyed partners, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had no desire for a working partner. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
wanted was a capitalist who had confidence in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), Mynors. In Ephraim
Tellwright he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) found the man. Whether it was by instinct, good luck, or
skilful diplomacy that Mynors secured this invaluable prize no one
could positively say, and perhaps even he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) himself could not have
catalogued all the obscure motives that had guided him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to the shrewd
miser of Manor Terrace.

<p/>Anna had meant to reach chapel before the commencement of the meeting,
but the interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) late. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entered the
porch an officer told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that the body of the chapel was quite full
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should go into the gallery, where a few seats were left
near the choir. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) obeyed: pew-holders had no rights at that service.
The scene in the auditorium astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), effectually putting an end
to the worldly preoccupation caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's news. The historic
chapel was crowded almost in every part, and the
congregation--impressed, excited, eager--sang the opening hymn with
unprecedented vigour and sincerity; above the rest could be heard the
trained voices of a large choir, and even the choir, usually
perfunctory, seemed to share the general fervour. In the vast mahogany
pulpit the Reverend Reginald Banks, the superintendent minister, a
stout pale-faced man with pendent cheeks and cold grey eyes, stood
impassively regarding the assemblage, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side was the
revivalist, a manikin in comparison with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colleague; on the broad
balustrade of the pulpit lay the cornet. The fiery and inquisitive
eyes of the revivalist probed into the furthest corners of the chapel;
apparently no detail of any single face or of the florid decoration
escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and as Anna crept into a small empty pew next to the east
wall she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too had been separately observed. Mr. Banks
gave out the last verse of the hymn, and simultaneously with the
leading chord from the organ the revivalist seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) cornet and
joined the melody. Massive yet exultant, the tones rose clear over the
mighty volume of vocal sound, an incitement to victorious effort. The
effect was instant: an ecstatic tremor seemed to pass through the
congregation, like wind through ripe corn, and at the close of the hymn
it was not until the revivalist had put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) cornet that the people
resumed their seats. Amid the _frou-frou_ of dresses and subdued
clearing of throats, Mr. Banks retired softly to the back of the
pulpit, and the revivalist, mounting a stool, suddenly dominated the
congregation. His (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) glance swept masterfully across the chapel and round
the gallery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) raised one hand with the stilling action of a
mesmerist, and the people, either kneeling or inclined against the
front of the pews, hid their faces from those eyes. It was as though
the man had in a moment measured their iniquities, and had courageously
resolved to intercede for them with God, but was not very sanguine as
to the result. Everyone except the organist, who was searching his (<font color='blue'><b>organist</b></font>)
tune-book for the next tune, seemed to feel humbled, bitterly ashamed,
as it were caught in the act of sin. There was a solemn and terrible
pause.

<p/>Then the revivalist began:

<p/>``Behold us, O dread God, suppliants for Thy mercy--'

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice was rich and full, but at the same time sharp and decisive.
The burning eyes were shut tight, and Anna, who had a profile view of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face, saw that every muscle of it was drawn tense. The man
possessed an extraordinary histrionic gift, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used it with
imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had two audiences, God and the congregation. God was
not more distant from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than the congregation, or less real to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),
or less a heart to be influenced. Declamatory and full of effects
carefully calculated--a work of art, in fact--his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) appeal showed no
error of discretion in its approach to the Eternal. There was no
minimising of committed sin, nor yet an insincere and grovelling
self-accusation. A tyrant could not have taken offence at its tone,
which seemed to pacify God while rendering the human audience still
more contrite. The conclusion of the catalogue of wickedness and swift
confident turn to Christ's Cross was marvellously impressive. The
congregation burst out into sighs, groans, blessings, and Amens; and
the pillars of distant rural conventicles who had travelled from the
confines of the circuit to its centre in order to partake of this
spiritual excitation began to feel that they would not be disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the Holy Ghost descend upon us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the revivalist pleaded with
restrained passion; and then, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) eyes and looking at the clock
in front of the gallery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Now, now, at twenty-one minutes
past seven.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) eyes, without shifting, seemed to ignore the
clock, to gaze through it into some unworldly dimension, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
murmured in a soft dramatic whisper: ``I see the Divine Dove!--'

<p/>The doors, closed during prayer, were opened, and more people entered.
A youth came into Anna's pew.

<p/>The superintendent minister gave out another hymn, and when this was
finished the revivalist, who had been resting in a chair, came forward
again. <div class="bookquote">``Friends and fellow-sinners,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said, 'a lot of you, fools
that you are, have come here to-night to hear me play my cornet. Well,
you have heard me. I have played the cornet, and I will play it again.
I would play it on my head if by so doing I could bring sinners to
Christ. I have been called a mountebank. I am one. I glory in it. I
am God's mountebank, doing God's precious business in my own way. But
God's precious business cannot be carried on, even by a mountebank,
without money, and there will be a collection towards the expenses of
the Revival. During the collection we will sing <div class="bookquote">``Rock of Ages,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and
you shall hear my cornet again. If you feel willing to give us your
sixpences, give; but if you resent a collection,<div class="bookquote">'' here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) adopted a
tone of ferocious sarcasm, `keep your miserable sixpences and get
sixpenny-worth of miserable enjoyment out of them elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>As the meeting proceeded, submitting itself more and more to the
imperious hypnotism of the revivalist, Anna gradually became oppressed
by a vague sensation which was partly sorrow and partly an inexplicable
dull anger--anger at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own penitence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt as if everything was
wrong and could never by any possibility be righted. After two
exhortations, from the minister and the revivalist, and another hymn,
the revivalist once more prayed, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) did so Anna looked
stealthily about in a sick, preoccupied way. The youth at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side
stared glumly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>). In the orchestra Henry Mynors was
whispering to the organist. Down in the body of the chapel the
atmosphere was electric, perilous, overcharged with spiritual emotion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not down there. The voice of the revivalist
ceased, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) kept the attitude of supplication. Sobs were heard in
various quarters, and here and there an elder of the chapel could be
seen talking quietly to some convicted sinner. The revivalist began
softly to sing <div class="bookquote">``Jesu, lover of my soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>the congregation</b></font>)</div>and most of the congregation,
standing up, joined him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>); but the sinners stricken of the Spirit
remained abjectly bent, tortured by conscience, pulled this way by
Christ and that by Satan. A few rose and went to the Communion rails,
there to kneel in the sight of all. Mr. Banks descended from the
pulpit and opening the wicket which led to the Communion table spoke to
these over the rails, reassuringly, as a nurse to a child. Other
sinners, desirous of fuller and more intimate guidance, passed down the
aisles and so into the preacher's vestry at the eastern end of the
chapel, and were followed thither by class-leaders and other proved
servants of God: among these last were Titus Price and Mr. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The blood of Christ atones,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the revivalist solemnly at the end
of the hymn. <div class="bookquote">``The spirit of Christ is working among us. Let us engage
in private prayer. Let us drive the devil out of this chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>More sighs and groans followed. Then someone cried out in sharp,
shrill tones, ``Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>);' and another cried, ``Praise Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>);' and an old
woman's quavering voice sang the words, <div class="bookquote">``I know that my Redeemer
liveth.''  (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div>Anna was in despair at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own predicament, and the sense of
sin was not more strong than the sense of being confused and publicly
shamed. A man opened the pew-door, and sitting down by the youth's
side began to talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was Henry Mynors. Anna looked
steadily away, at the wall, fearful lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) should address her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) too.
Presently the youth got up with a frenzied gesture and walked out of
the gallery, followed by Mynors. In a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw the youth
stepping awkwardly along the aisle beneath, towards the inquiry room,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) head forward, and the lower lip hanging as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) were sulky.

<p/>Anna was now in the profoundest misery. The weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sins, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
ingratitude to God, lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) like a physical and intolerable load,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lost all feeling of shame, as a sea-sick voyager loses shame
after an hour of nausea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew then that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could no longer go on
living as aforetime. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shuddered at the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tremendous
responsibility to Agnes--Agnes who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for perfection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
recollected all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sins individually--lies, sloth, envy, vanity, even
theft in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) infancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heaped up all the wickedness of a lifetime,
hysterically augmented it, and found a horrid pleasure in the
exaggeration. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) virtuous acts shrank into nothingness.

<p/>A man, and then another, emerged from the vestry door with beaming,
happy face. These were saved; they had yielded to Christ's persuasive
invitation. Anna tried to imagine herself converted, or in the process
of being converted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could only sit moveless, dull,
and abject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not stir, even when the congregation rose for
another hymn. In what did conversion consist? Was it to say the
words, ``I believe'? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) repeated to herself softly, <div class="bookquote">``I believe; I
believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But nothing happened. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) believed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
never doubted, or dreamed of doubting, that Jesus died on the Cross to
save her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul--_her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)_ soul--from eternal damnation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was probably
unaware that any person in Christendom had doubted that fact so
fundamental to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). What, then, was lacking? What was belief? What
was faith?

<p/>A venerable class-leader came from the vestry, and, slowly climbing the
pulpit stairs, whispered in the ear of the revivalist. The latter
faced the congregation with a cry of joy. <div class="bookquote">``Lord,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) exclaimed, `we
bless Thee that seventeen souls have found Thee! Lord, let the full
crop be gathered, for the fields are white unto harvest.'' There was an
exuberant chorus of praise to God.

<p/>The door of the pew was opened gently, and Anna started to see Mrs.
Sutton at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) at once guessed that Mynors had sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
this angel of consolation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you near the light, dear Anna?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton began.

<p/>Anna searched for an answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now sat huddled up in the corner of
the pew, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face partially turned towards Mrs. Sutton, who looked
mildly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna stammered, feeling like a
naughty school-girl. A doubt whether the whole affair was not after
all absurd flashed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is quite simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you
anything that you do not know. Cast out pride. Cast out pride--that
is it. Nothing but earthly pride prevents you from realising the
saving power of Christ. You are afraid, Anna, afraid to be humble. Be
brave. It is so simple, so easy. If one will but submit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna said nothing, had nothing to say, was conscious of nothing save
excessive discomfort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you feel your difficulty to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) answered wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The happiness that awaits you is unspeakable. I have followed Christ
for nearly fifty years, and my happiness increases daily. Sometimes I
do not know how to contain it all. It surges above all the trials and
disappointments of this world. Oh, Anna, if you will but believe!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The ageing woman's thin, distinguished face, crowned with abundant grey
hair, glistened with love and compassion, and as Anna's eyes rested
upon it Anna felt that here was something tangible, something to lay
hold on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I do believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said weakly.

<p/>``You ``think<div class="bookquote">''? Are you sure? Are you not deceiving yourself? Belief
is not with the lips: it is with the heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause. Mr. Banks could be heard praying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna whispered at length, `and think it out for
myself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do, my dear girl, and God will help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sutton bent and kissed Anna affectionately, and then hurried away
to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ministrations elsewhere. As Anna left the chapel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
encountered the chapel-keeper pacing regularly to and fro across the
length of the broad steps. In the porch was a notice that cabinet
photographs of the revivalist could be purchased on application, at one
shilling each.




<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>WILLIE

<p/>Anna closed the bedroom door softly; through the open window came the
tones of Cauldon Church clock, famous for their sonority, and richness,
announcing eleven. Agnes lay asleep under the blue-and-white
counterpane, on the side of the bed next the wall, the bed-clothes
pushed down and disclosing the upper half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) night-gowned figure.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) slept in absolute repose, with flushed cheek and every muscle lax,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hair by some chance drawn in a perfect straight line diagonally
across the pillow. Anna glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister, the image of physical
innocence and childish security, and then, depositing the candle, went
to the window and looked out.

<p/>The bedroom was over the kitchen and faced south. The moon was hidden
by clouds, but clear stretches of sky showed thick-studded clusters of
stars brightly winking. To the far right across the fields the
silhouette of Hillport Church could just be discerned on the ridge. In
front, several miles away, the blast-furnaces of Cauldon Bar Ironworks
shot up vast wreaths of yellow flame with canopies of tinted smoke.
Still more distant were a thousand other lights crowning chimney and
kiln, and nearer, on the waste lands west of Bleakridge, long fields of
burning ironstone glowed with all the strange colours of decadence.
The entire landscape was illuminated and transformed by these unique
pyrotechnics of labour atoning for its grime, and dull, weird sounds,
as of the breathings and sighings of gigantic nocturnal creatures,
filled the enchanted air. It was a romantic scene, a romantic summer
night, balmy, delicate, and wrapped in meditation. But Anna saw
nothing there save the repulsive evidences of manufacture, had never
seen anything else.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was still horribly, acutely miserable, exhausted by the fruitless
search for some solution of the enigma of sin--her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sin in
particular--and of redemption. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had cogitated in a vain circle
until she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was no longer capable of reasoned ideas. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gazed at the
stars and into the illimitable spaces beyond them, and thought of life
and its inconceivable littleness, as millions had done before in the
presence of that same firmament. Then, after a time, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brain resumed
its nightmare-like task. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began to probe herself anew. Would it
have availed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had walked publicly to the penitential form at the
Communion rail, and, ranging herself with the working men and women,
proved by that overt deed the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) contrition? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished
ardently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done so, yet knew well that such an act would
always be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), even though the evasion of it meant
eternal torture. Undoubtedly, as Mrs. Sutton had implied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) was
proud, stiff-necked, obstinate in iniquity.

<p/>Agnes stirred slightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sleep, and Anna, aroused, dropped the
blind, turned towards the room and began to undress, slowly, with
reflective pauses. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) melancholy became grim, sardonic; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
doomed to destruction, so let it be. Suddenly, half-glad, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knelt
down and prayed, prayed that pride might be cast out, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face
in the coverlet and caging the passionate effusion in a whisper lest
Agnes should be disturbed. Having prayed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) still knelt quiescent;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) eyes were dry and burning. The last car thundered up the road,
shaking the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) rose, finished undressing, blew out the
candle, and slipped into bed by Agnes's side.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) could not sleep, did not attempt to sleep, but abandoned herself
meekly to despair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thoughts covered again the interminable round,
and again, and yet again. In the twilight of the brief summer night
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) accustomed eyes could distinguish every object in the room, all the
bits of furniture which had been bought from Hanbridge and with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had been familiar since her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) memory began: everything appeared mean,
despicable, cheerless; there was nothing to inspire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) dreamed
impossibly of a high spirituality which should metamorphose all, change
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) life, lend glamour to the most pitiful surroundings, ennoble the
most ignominious burdens--a spirituality never to be hers.

<p/>At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father in the morning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was
convicted of sin, and, however hopelessly, seeking salvation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) would
tell both her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father and Agnes at breakfast. The task would be
difficult, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) swore to do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) resolved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) endeavoured to
sleep, and did sleep uneasily for a short period. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) woke the
great business of the dawn had begun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) left the bed, and drawing up
the blind looked forth. The furnace fires were paling; a few milky
clouds sailed in the vast pallid blue. It was cool just then, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
shivered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) went to the glass, and examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) face carefully, but
it gave no signs whatever of the inward warfare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) plain and
mended night-gown. Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) were married to Mynors! Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) lay
asleep in the bed where Agnes lay asleep! Involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) glanced at
Agnes to certify that the child and none else was indeed there, and got
into bed hurriedly and hid herself because she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was ashamed to have had
such a fancy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) continued to think of Mynors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) cheerfulness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) joy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) goodness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) dignity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) tact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) envied every man. Even in the sphere of religion, men were
not fettered like women. No man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thought, would acquiesce in the
futility to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was already half resigned; a man would either
wring salvation from the heavenly powers or race gloriously to hell.
Mynors--Mynors was a god!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) resolution to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father and Agnes at
breakfast, and shudderingly confirmed it, but less stoutly than before.
Then an announcement made by Mr. Banks in chapel on the previous
evening presented itself, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was listening to it for the
first time. It was the announcement of a prayer-meeting for workers in
the Revival, to be held that -LRB-Saturday-RRB- morning at seven o'clock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
instantly decided to go to the meeting, and the decision seemed to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) new hope. Perhaps there she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) might find peace. On that faint
expectancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) fell asleep again and did not wake till half-past six,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) usual hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) heard noises in the yard; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father
going towards the garden with a wheelbarrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) dressed quickly, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had pinned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) woke Agnes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going out, Sis?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child asked sleepily, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) attire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear. I am going to the seven o'clock prayer-meeting. And you
must get breakfast. You can--can't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child assented, glad of the chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what are you going to the prayer-meeting for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna hesitated. Why not confess? No. <div class="bookquote">``I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said quietly
at length. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be back before eight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does father know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes enquired apprehensively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna shut the door quickly, went softly downstairs and along the
passage, and crept into the street like a thief.

<p/>Men and women and boys and girls were on their way to work, with
hurried clattering steps, some munching thick pieces of bread as they
went, all self-centred, apparently morose and not quite awake. The
dust lay thick in the arid gutters, and in drifts across the pavement;
as the night-wind had blown it. Vehicular traffic had not begun, and
blinds were still drawn; and though the footpaths were busy the street
had a deserted and forlorn aspect. Anna walked hastily down the road,
avoiding the glances of such as looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), but peering furtively at
the faces of those who ignored her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). All seemed callous--hoggishly
careless of the everlasting verities. At first it appeared strange to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that the potent revival in the Wesleyan chapel had produced no
effect on these preoccupied people. Bursley, then, continued its dull
and even course. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered whether any of them guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
going to the prayer-meeting and secretly sneered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) therefore.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had climbed Duck Bank she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) surprise that the doors
of the chapel were fast closed, though it was ten minutes past seven.
Was there to be no prayer-meeting? A momentary sensation of relief
flashed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that the gate of the school-yard
was open. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should have known that early morning prayers were never
offered up in the chapel, but in the lecture-hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) crossed the
quadrangle with beating heart, feeling now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had embarked on a
frightful enterprise. The door of the lecture-hall was ajar; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
pushed it and went in. At the other end of the hall a meagre handful
of worshippers were collected, and on the raised platform stood Mr.
Banks, vapid, perfunctory and fatigued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) gave out a verse, and
pitched the tune--too high, but the singers with a heroic effect
accomplished the verse without breaking down. The singing was thin and
feeble, and the eagerness of one or two voices seemed strained, as
though with a determination to make the best of things. Mynors was not
present, and Anna did not know whether to be sorry or glad at this.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recognised that save herself all present were old believers, tried
warriors of the Lord. There was only one other woman, Miss Sarah
Vodrey, an aged spinster who kept house for Titus Price and his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) son,
and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) sole diversion in the variety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) religious
experiences. Before the hymn was finished a young man joined the
assembly; it was the youth who had sat near Anna on the previous night,
an ecstatic and naïve bliss shone from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prayer the
minister drew the attention of the Deity to the fact that although a
score or more of souls had been ingathered at the first service, the
Methodists of Bursley were by no means satisfied. They wanted more;
they wanted the whole of Bursley; and they would be content with no
less. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begged that their earnest work might not be shamed before the
world by a partial success. In conclusion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought the blessing of
God on the revivalist and asked that this tireless enthusiast might be
led to husband his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) strength: at which there was a fervent Amen.

<p/>Several men prayed, and a pause ensued, all still kneeling.

<p/>Then the minister said in a tone of oily politeness:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will a sister pray?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div><p/>Another pause followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sister Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna would have welcomed death and damnation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands
tightly, and longed for the endless moment to pass. At last Sarah
Vodrey gave a preliminary cough. Miss Vodrey was always happy to pray
aloud, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) invocations usually began with the same phrase: <div class="bookquote">``Lord,
we thank Thee that this day finds us with our bodies out of the grave
and our souls out of hell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Vodrey</b></font>)</div><p/>Afterwards the minister gave out another hymn, and as soon as the
singing commenced Anna slipped away. Once in the yard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breathed a
sigh of relief. Peace at the prayer-meeting? It was like coming out
of prison. Peace was farther off than ever. Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had actually
forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul in the sensations of shame and discomfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
contrived only to make herself ridiculous, and perhaps the pious at
their breakfast-tables would discuss her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, and their
money, and the queer life they led.

<p/>If Mynors had but been present!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked out into the street. It was twenty minutes to eight by the
town-hall clock. The last workmen's car of the morning was just
leaving Bursley: it was packed inside and outside, and the conductor
hung insecurely on the step. At the gates of the manufactory opposite
the chapel, a man in a white smock stood placidly smoking a pipe. A
prayer-meeting was a little thing, a trifle in the immense and regular
activity of the town: this thought necessarily occurred to Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
hurried homewards, wondering what her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father would say about that
morning's unusual excursion. A couple of hundred yards distant from
home she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) astonishment, Agnes emerging from the front-door
of the house. The child ran rapidly down the street, not observing
Anna till they were close upon each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Anna! You forgot to buy the bacon yesterday. There isn't a
_scrap_, and father's fearfully angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave me sixpence, and I'm
going down to Leal's to get some as quick as ever I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a thunderbolt to Anna, this seemingly petty misadventure. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entered the house she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt a tear on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was ashamed to
weep, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wept. This, after the fiasco of the prayer-meeting, was
a climax of woe; it overtopped and extinguished all the rest; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul
was nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) quickly took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat and ran to the
kitchen. Agnes had put the breakfast-things on the tray ready for
setting; the bread was cut, the coffee portioned into the jug; the fire
burned bright, and the kettle sang. Anna took the cloth from the
drawer in the oak dresser, and went to the parlour to lay the table.
Mr. Tellwright was at the end of the garden, pointing the wall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
back to the house. The table set, Anna observed that the room was only
partly dusted: there was a duster on the mantelpiece; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seized it to
finish, and at that moment the kitchen clock struck eight.
Simultaneously Mr. Tellwright dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) trowel, and came towards the
house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) doggedly dusted one chair, and then, turning coward, flew
away upstairs; the kitchen was barred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father would
enter by the kitchen door.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had forgotten to buy bacon, and breakfast would be late: it was a
calamity unique in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) experience! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
bedroom, and waited, vehemently, for Agnes's return. At last the child
raced breathlessly in; Anna flew to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). With incredible speed
the bacon was whipped out of its wrapper, and Anna picked up the knife.
At the first stroke she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cut herself, and Agnes was obliged to bind the
finger with rag. The clock struck the half-hour like a knell. It was
twenty minutes to nine, forty minutes behind time, when the two girls
hurried into the parlour, Anna bearing the bacon and hot plates, Agnes
the bread and coffee. Mr. Tellwright sat upright and ferocious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
chair, the image of offence and wrath. Instead of reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) letters
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had fed full of this ineffable grievance. The meal began in a
desolating silence. The male creature's terrible displeasure permeated
the whole room like an ether, invisible but carrying vibrations to the
heart. Then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had eaten one piece of bacon, and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
envelopes, the miser began to empty himself of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) anger in
stormy tones that might have uprooted trees. Anna ought to feel
thoroughly ashamed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) could not imagine what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been thinking
of. Why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was going to the prayer-meeting? Why
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) go to the prayer-meeting, disarranging the whole household?
How came she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to forget the bacon? It was gross carelessness. A pretty
example to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) little sister! The fact was that _since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) birthday_
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had gotten above hersen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was careless and extravagant. Look
how thick the bacon was cut. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) should not stand it much longer. And
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) finger all red, and the blood dropping on the cloth: a nice sight
at a meal! Go and tie it up again.

<p/>Without a word she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) left the room to obey. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no
defence. Agnes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) tears falling, pecked her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) food timidly like a
bird, not daring to stir from her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) chair, even to assist at the finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Mr. Mynors say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright inquired fiercely when Anna had
come back into the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) murmured, at a loss, but vaguely apprehending further
trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ye see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ye give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) my message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgot it.''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>God in heaven! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had forgotten the message!

<p/>With a devastating grunt Mr. Tellwright walked speechless out of the
room. The girls cleared the table, exchanging sympathy with a single
mute glance. Anna's one satisfaction was that, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
remembered the message, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not possibly have delivered it.

<p/>Ephraim Tellwright stayed in the front parlour till half-past ten
o'clock, unseen but felt, like an angry god behind a cloud. The
consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was there, unappeased and dangerous, remained
uppermost in the minds of the two girls during the morning. At
half-past ten he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) commanded, and Agnes ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) from the kitchen with the
speed of propitiation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this note down to Price's, and don't wait for an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was back in twenty minutes. Anna was sweeping the lobby.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Mynors calls while I'm out, you mun tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Tellwright said to Agnes, pointedly ignoring Anna's presence. Then,
having brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) greenish hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) sleeve he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) went off towards town
to buy meat and vegetables. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) always did Saturday's marketing
himself. At the butcher's and in the St. Luke's covered market he (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) was
a familiar and redoubtable figure. Among the salespeople who stood the
market was a wrinkled, hardy old potato-woman from the other side of
Moorthorne: every Saturday the miser bested her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in their
higgling-match, and nearly every Saturday she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) scornfully threw at him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)
the same joke: ``Get thee along to th' post-office, Master Terrick:-LSB-1-RSB-
happen they'll give thee sixpenn`orth o' stamps for fivepence
ha<div class="bookquote">``penny.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) seldom failed to laugh heartily at this.

<p/>At dinner the girls could perceive that the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) displeasure
had slightly lifted, though he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) kept a frowning silence. Expert in all
the symptoms of his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) moods, they knew that in a few hours he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) would begin
to talk again, at first in monosyllables, and then in short detached
sentences. An intimation of relief diffused itself through the house
like a hint of spring in February.

<p/>These domestic upheavals followed always the same course, and Anna had
learnt to suffer the later stages of them with calmness and even with
impassivity. Henry Mynors had not called. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) supposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father had expected him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to call for the answer which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had forgotten
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would come in the afternoon:
once again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had the idea that something definite and satisfactory
might result if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could only see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might, as it were,
gather inspiration from the mere sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. After dinner,
while the girls were washing the dinner things in the scullery, Agnes's
quick ear caught the sound of voices in the parlour. They listened.
Mynors had come. Mr. Tellwright must have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) from the front
window and opened the door to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) could ring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked, self-consciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child sharply, making it quite plain
that this affectation could not impose on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for a single instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>It was Mr. Tellwright's summons, through the parlour window.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands, doffed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) apron, and went to the parlour,
animated by a thousand fears and expectations. Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to be
included in the colloquy?

<p/>Mynors rose at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) entrance and greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with conspicuous deference,
a deference which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feel ashamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man growled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obviously content. <div class="bookquote">``I gave Anna
a message for ye yesterday, Mr. Mynors, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot to deliver it,
wench-like. Ye might ha' been saved th' trouble o' calling. Now as
ye're here, I've summat for tell ye. It 'll be Anna's money as 'll go
into that concern o' yours. I've none by me; in fact, I'm a`most fast
for brass, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) 'll have as near two thousand as makes no matter in
a month's time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) says her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) 'll go in wi' you on th' strength o'
my recommendation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech was evidently a perfect surprise for Henry Mynors. For a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) seemed to be at a loss; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) face gave candid expression
to a feeling of intense pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know all about this business then, Miss Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blushed. <div class="bookquote">``Father has told me something about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you willing to be my partner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I did na' say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tellwright interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``It 'll be Anna's
money, but i' my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mynors gravely. <div class="bookquote">``But if it is Miss Anna's money, why
should not she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) be the partner?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) offered one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) courtly
diplomatic smiles.

<p/>``Oh--but--' Anna began in deprecation.

<p/>Tellwright laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, `why not? It 'll be experience for
th' lass.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/>Anna stood silent, like a child who is being talked about. There was a
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you care for that arrangement, Miss Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/>``I shall try to justify your confidence. I needn't say that I think
you and your father will have no reason to be disappointed. Two
thousand pounds is of course only a trifle to you, but it is a great
deal to me, and--and--' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hesitated. Anna did not surmise that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was too much moved by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and the situation, to continue,
but this was the fact.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nobbut one point, Mr. Mynors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright said bluntly, `and
that's the interest on th' capital, as must be deducted before
reckoning profits. Us must have six per cent.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought we had settled it at five,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mynors with sudden
firmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We 'n settled as you shall have five on your fifteen hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the
miser replied with imperturbable audacity, `but us mun have our six.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly thought we had thrashed that out fully, and agreed that
the interest should be the same on each side.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors was alert and
defensive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, young man. Us mun have our six. We're takkin' a risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) lips together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was taken at a disadvantage. Mr.
Tellwright, with unscrupulous cleverness, had utilized the effect on
Mynors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) daughter's presence to regain a position from which the
younger man had definitely ousted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a few days before. Mynors was
annoyed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) gave no sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said at length, with a private smile at Anna to
indicate that it was out of regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) yielded.

<p/>Mr. Tellwright made no pretence of concealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) satisfaction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>),
too, smiled at Anna, sardonically: the last vestige of the morning's
irritation vanished in a glow of triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``There is a
service at chapel at three. Our Revivalist came down with Mrs. Sutton
to look over the works this morning, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I should be at the
service. So I must. You coming, Mr. Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my lad. I'm owd enough to leave it to young uns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) courage to the verge of rashness, moved by a swift
impulse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you wait one minute?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to the
service. If I'm late back, father, Agnes will see to the tea. Don't
wait for me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) straight in the face. It was one of the
bravest acts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life. After the episode of breakfast, to suggest a
procedure which might entail any risk upon another meal was absolutely
heroic. Tellwright glanced away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) daughter, and at Mynors.
Anna hurried upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's thy lawyer, Mr. Mynors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That 'll be convenient. Dane does my bit o' business, too. I'll see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), and make a bargain wi' him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) for th' partnership deed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) always
works by contract for me. I've no patience wi' six-and-eight-pences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors assented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must come down some afternoon and look over the works,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said to
Anna as they were walking down Trafalgar Road towards chapel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied. <div class="bookquote">``I've never been over a works in my
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No? You are going to be a partner in the best works of its size in
Bursley,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors said enthusiastically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled, `for I do believe I own the worst.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--Price's do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exclaimed, and seemed to be thinking. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't sure whether
that belonged to you or your father. I'm afraid it isn't quite the
best of properties. But perhaps I'd better say nothing about that. We
had a grand meeting last night. Our little cornet-player quite lived
up to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reputation, don't you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You enjoyed the meeting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) blurted out, dismayed but resolute to be honest.

<p/>There was a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you were at the early prayer-meeting this morning, I hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said nothing while they took a dozen paces, and then murmured,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>Their eyes met for a second, hers full of trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said at length, `perhaps--excuse me saying this--but you
may be expecting too much--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), prepared now to finish what had been begun.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, earnestly, `that I--we--cannot promise you any
sudden change of feeling, any sudden relief and certainty, such as some
people experience. At least, I never had it. What is called
conversion can happen in various ways. It is a question of living, of
constant endeavour, with the example of Christ always before us. It
need not always be a sudden wrench, you know, from the world. Perhaps
you have been expecting too much,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) repeated, as though offering balm
with that phrase.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sincerely, but not with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) lips, only with the heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) an avenue of release from a situation which had
seemed on all sides fatally closed. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sprang eagerly towards it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) realised afresh how frightful was the dilemma from which there was
now a hope of escape, and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was grateful accordingly. Before, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
had not dared steadily to face its terrors. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wondered that even her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
father's displeasure or the project of the partnership had been able to
divert her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) from the plight of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) soul. Putting these mundane things
firmly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) concentrated the activities of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) brain on that
idea of Christ-like living, day by day, hour by hour, of a gradual
aspiration towards Christ and thereby an ultimate arrival at the state
of being saved. This she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) might accomplish; this gave
opportunity of immediate effort, dispensing with the necessity of an
impossible violent spiritual metamorphosis. They did not speak again
until they had reached the gates of the chapel, when Mynors, who had to
enter the choir from the back, bade her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) a quiet adieu. Anna enjoyed
the service, which passed smoothly and uneventfully. At a Revival,
night is the time of ecstasy and fervour and salvation; in the
afternoon one must be content with preparatory praise and prayer.

<p/>That evening, while father and daughters sat in the parlour after
supper, there was a ring at the door. Agnes ran to open, and found
Willie Price. It had begun to rain, and the visitor, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) jacket-collar
turned up, was wet and draggled. Agnes left him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) on the mat and ran
back to the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Mr. Price wants to see you, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div><p/>Tellwright motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) to shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd best see him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's none my business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) come about, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That note as I sent down this morning. I told owd Titus as he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) mun pay
us twenty pun' on Monday morning certain, or us should distrain. Them
as can pay ten pun, especially in bank notes, can pay twenty pun, and
thirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) can<div class="bookquote">``t?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) must. I've figured it out and changed my mind about that
works. Owd Titus isna' done for yet, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>)'s getting on that road.
Us can screw another fifty out o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>), that 'll only leave six months
rent owing; then us can turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>)'ll go bankrupt; us can claim
for our rent afore th' other creditors, and us 'll have a hundred or a
hundred and twenty in hand towards doing the owd place up a bit for a
new tenant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) bankrupt, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna exclaimed. It was the only part of
the ingenious scheme which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had understood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said laconically.

<p/>``But--' -LRB-Would Christ have driven Titus Price into the bankruptcy
court?-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) pays, well and good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better see Mr. William, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose property is it, mine or thine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright growled. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) good
humour was still precarious, insecurely re-established, and Anna
obediently left the room. After all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to herself, a debt is a
debt, and honest people pay what they owe.

<p/>It was in an uncomplaisant tone that Anna invited Willie Price to the
front parlour: nervousness always made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seem harsh and moreover she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had not the trick of hiding firmness under suavity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come this way, Mr. Price?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said with ingratiating, eager compliance. Dusk was falling,
and the room in shadow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to take a chair, so they
both stood up during the interview.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A grand meeting we had last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) began, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``I
saw you there, Miss Tellwright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. There was a splendid muster of teachers. I wanted to be at the
prayer-meeting this morning, but couldn't get away. Did you happen to
go, Miss Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been present, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) another
curt monosyllable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have liked to be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), to reassure
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) happy and comfortable, so ludicrous and touching were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) efforts after a social urbanity which should appease; but, just as
much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was unskilled in the subtle arts of converse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) continued, `and I was anxious to be at to-night's meeting,
but the dad asked me to come up here. He (<font color='blue'><b>dad</b></font>) said I'd better.<div class="bookquote">'' That term,
`the dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>uttered in William's slow, drawling voice, seemed to show
Titus Price in a new light to Anna, as a human creature loved, not as a
mere gross physical organism: the effect was quite surprising. William
went on: <div class="bookquote">``Can I see your father, Miss Tellwright?''

 (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it about the rent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said.

<p/>``Well, if you will tell me--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I beg pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I know it's your
property, but I thought Mr. Tellwright always saw after it for you. It
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) that wrote that letter this morning, wasn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not explain the situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You insist on another twenty pounds on Monday?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We paid ten last Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is still over a hundred owing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, but--oh, Miss Tellwright, you mustn't be hard on us. Trade's
bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It says in the ``Signal<div class="bookquote">'' that trade is improving,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) interrupted
sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But look at prices; they're cut till there's no
profit left. I assure you, Miss Tellwright, my father and me are
having a hard struggle. Everything's against us, and the works in
particular, as you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) tone was so earnest, so pathetic, that tears of compassion almost
rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at those simple naïve blue eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lanky figure and clumsily-fitting clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) feeble placatory
smile, the twitching movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) long red hands, all contributed
to the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) defencelessness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought of the test:
<div class="bookquote">``Blessed are the meek,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and saw in a flash the deep truth of it. Here
were she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, rich, powerful, autocratic; and there were
Willie Price and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) father, commercial hares hunted by hounds of
creditors, hares that turned in plaintive appeal to those greedy jaws
for mercy. And yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), a hound, envied at that moment the hares.
Blessed are the meek, blessed are the failures, blessed are the stupid,
for they, unknown to themselves, have a grace which is denied to the
haughty, the successful, and the wise. The very repulsiveness of old
Titus, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) underhand methods, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) insincerities, only served to
increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sympathy for the pair. How could Titus help being himself
any more than Henry Mynors could help being himself? And that idea led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to think of the prospective partnership, destined by every
favourable sign to brilliant success, and to contrast it with the
ignoble and forlorn undertaking in Edward Street.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to discover some method of soothing the young man's fears, of
being considerate to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without injuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's scheme.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will pay what you owe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, `we will spend it all, every
penny, on improving the works.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered with fatal emphasis, `we cannot pay.''

<p/>Ah! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished to follow Christ day by day, hour by hour--constantly
to endeavour after saintliness. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to do now? Left to
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might have said in a burst of impulsive generosity, <div class="bookquote">``I
forgive you all arrears. Start afresh.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father had to be
reckoned with.....

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do you think you can pay on Monday?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked coldly.

<p/>At that moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father entered the room. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first act was to light
the gas. Willie Price's eyes blinked at the glare, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) were
trembling before the anticipated decree of this implacable old man.
Anna's heart beat with sympathetic apprehension. Tellwright shook
hands grimly with the youth, who re-stated hurriedly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had said
to Anna.

<p/>``It's o' this<div class="bookquote">``n,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the old man began with finality, and stopped. Anna
caught a glance from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dismissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went out in silence. On
the Monday Titus Price paid another twenty pounds.

<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>THE SEWING MEETING

<p/>On an afternoon ten days later, Mr. Sutton's coachman, Barrett by name,
arrived at Ephraim Tellwright's back-door with a note. The Tellwrights
were having tea. The note could be seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) enormous hand, and
Agnes went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An answer, if you please, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) hat, and
giving a pull to the leathern belt which, surrounding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) waist, alone
seemed to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) frame together. Agnes, much impressed, took the
note. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had never before seen that resplendent automaton apart from
the equipage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) directed. Always afterwards, Barrett formally
saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) in the streets, affording her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thus, every time, a thrilling
moment of delicious joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A letter, and there's an answer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>)'s waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) cried, running
into the parlour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Less row!''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``Here, give it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's for Miss Tellwright--that's Anna, isn't it? Oh! Scent!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
put the grey envelope to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) nose like a flower.

<p/>Anna, secretly as excited as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister, opened the note and
read:--<div class="bookquote">``Lansdowne House, Wednesday. Dear Miss Tellwright,--Mother
gives tea to the Sunday-school Sewing Meeting here _to-morrow_. Will
you give us the pleasure of your company? I do not think you have been
to any of the S.S.S. meetings yet, but we should all be glad to see you
and have your assistance. Everyone is working very hard for the Autumn
Bazaar, and mother has set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind on the Sunday-school stall being
the best. Do come, will you? Excuse this short notice. Yours
sincerely, BEATRICE SUTTON. P.S.--We begin at 3.30.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They want me to go to their sewing meeting to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed
timidly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, pushing the note towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) across the table.
<div class="bookquote">``Must I go, father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What dost ask me for? Please thysen. I've nowt do wi' it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't want to go--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Sis, _do_ go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I'd better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) agreed, but with the misgivings of
diffidence. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't a rag to wear. I really must have a new dress,
father, at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hast forgotten as that there coachman's waiting?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remarked curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I run and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) you'll go?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes suggested. <div class="bookquote">``It 'll be
splendid for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly, dear. I must write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, write then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child energetically. <div class="bookquote">``I'll get you the
ink and paper.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) flew about and hovered over Anna while the answer
to the invitation was being written. Anna made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reply as short and
simple as possible, and then tendered it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's inspection.
<div class="bookquote">``Will that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pretended to be nonchalant, but in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was somewhat interested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou's forgotten to put th' date in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
threw the note back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've put Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not the date.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it matter? Beatrice Sutton only puts Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) response was to walk out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vexed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes asked anxiously. There had been a whole week of
almost perfect amenity.


<p/>The next day at half-past three Anna, having put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) best clothes,
was ready to start. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen almost nothing of social life, and
the prospect of taking part in this entertainment of the Suttons filled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with trepidation. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) arrive early, in which case she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would
have to talk more, or late, in which case there would be the ordeal of
entering a crowded room? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not decide. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's bedroom, whose window overlooked Trafalgar Road, and saw from
behind a curtain that small groups of ladies were continually passing
up the street to disappear into Alderman Sutton's house. Most of the
women she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recognised; others she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew but vaguely by sight. Then the
stream ceased, and suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard the kitchen clock strike four.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran downstairs--Agnes, swollen by importance, was carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
father's tea into the parlour--and hastened out the back way. In
another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) was at the Suttons' front-door. A servant in black
alpaca, with white wristbands, cap, streams, and embroidered apron
-LRB-each article a _dernier cri_ from Bostock's great shop at Hanbridge-RRB-,
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) in a subdued and respectful tone to step within. Externally
there had been no sign of the unusual, but once inside the house Anna
found it a humming hive of activity. Women laden with stuffs and
implements were crossing the picture-hung hall, their footsteps
noiseless on the thick rugs which lay about in rich confusion. On
either hand was an open door, and from each door came the sound of many
eager voices. Beyond these doors a broad staircase rose majestically
to unseen heights, closing the vista of the hall. As the servant was
demanding Anna's name, Beatrice Sutton, radiant and gorgeous, came with
a rush out of the room to the left, the dining-room, and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) by
both hands, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, we thought you were never coming. Everyone's here, except
the men, of course. Come along upstairs and take your things off. I'm
so glad you've kept your promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you think I should break it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, as they ascended the easy
gradient of the stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, my dear. But you're such a shy little bird.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>The conception of herself as a shy little bird amused Anna. By a
curious chain of ideas she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came to wonder who could clean those stairs
the better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) or this gay and flitting butterfly in a pale green
tea-gown. Beatrice led the way to a large bedroom, crammed with
furniture and knick-knacks. There were three mirrors in this spacious
apartment--one in the wardrobe, a cheval-glass, and a third over the
mantelpiece; the frame of the last was bordered with photographs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Will you put your things on the
bed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The bed was already laden with hats, bonnets, jackets, and wraps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope your mother won't give me anything fancy to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm no good at anything except plain sewing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice answered carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``It's all plain
sewing.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) drew a cardboard box from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) pocket, and offered it to
Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Here, have one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were chocolate creams.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, taking one. <div class="bookquote">``Aren't they very expensive? I've
never seen any like these before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Just ordinary. Four shillings a pound. Papa buys them for me: I
simply dote on them. I love to eat them in bed, if I can't sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice made these statements with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mouth full. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you adore
chocolates?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna lamely replied. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I like them.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) only
adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister, and perhaps God; and this was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
tasted chocolate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't _live_ without them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Your hair is lovely.
I never saw such a brown. What wash do you use?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wash?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, don't you put anything on it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, never.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Take care you don't lose it, that's all. Now, will you come
and have just a peep at my studio--where I paint, you know? I'd like
you to see it before we go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They proceeded to a small room on the second floor, with a sloping
ceiling and a dormer window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm obliged to have this room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice explained, `because it's the
only one in the house with a north light, and of course you can't do
without that. How do you like it?''

<p/>Anna said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) liked it very much.

<p/>The walls of the room were hung with various odd curtains of Eastern
design. Attached somehow to these curtains some coloured plates, bits
of pewter, and a few fans were hung high in apparently precarious
suspense. Lower down on the walls were pictures and sketches, chiefly
unframed, of flowers, fishes, loaves of bread, candlesticks, mugs,
oranges and tea-trays. On an immense easel in the middle of the room
was an unfinished portrait of a man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked, ignorant of those rules of caution which are
observed by the practised frequenter of studios.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice exclaimed, shocked. <div class="bookquote">``That's papa; I'm doing
his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) portrait; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sits in that chair there. The silly old master at the
school won't let me draw from life yet--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) keeps me to the antique--so
I said to myself I would study the living model at home. I'm
dreadfully in earnest about it, you know--I really am. Mother says I
work far too long up here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna was unable to perceive that the picture bore any resemblance to
Alderman Sutton, except in the matter of the aldermanic robe, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
could now trace beneath the portrait's neck. The studies on the walls
pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) much better. Their realism amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). One could make out
not only that here for instance, was a fish--there was no doubt that it
was a hallibut; the solid roundness of the oranges and the glitter on
the tea-trays seemed miraculously achieved. <div class="bookquote">``Have you actually done
all these?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, in genuine admiration. <div class="bookquote">``I think they're
splendid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, they're all mine; they're only still-life studies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice
said contemptuously of them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was nevertheless flattered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see now that that _is_ Mr. Sutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said, pointing to the easel
picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's pa right enough. But I'm sure I'm boring you. Let's go
down now, or perhaps we shall catch it from mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>As Anna, in the wake of Beatrice, entered the drawing-room, a dozen or
more women glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with keen curiosity, and the even flow of
conversation ceased for a moment, to be immediately resumed. In the
centre of the room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back to the fire-place, Mrs. Sutton was
seated at a square table, cutting out. Although the afternoon was warm
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had a white woollen wrap over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) shoulders; for the rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) was
attired in plain black silk, with a large stuff apron containing a
pocket for scissors and chalk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) jumped up with the activity of
which Beatrice had inherited a part, and greeted Anna, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
heartily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, my dear? So pleased you have come.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The time-worn
phrases came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thin, nervous lips full of sincere and kindly
welcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wrinkled face broke into a warm, life-giving smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Beatrice, find Miss Anna a chair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>There were two chairs in the bay
of the window, and one of them was occupied by Miss Dickinson, whom
Anna slightly knew. The other, being empty, was assigned to the
late-comer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you want something to do, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother, let Miss Tellwright have something to get on with at once.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) has a lot of time to make up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sutton, who had sat down again, smiled across at Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Let me
see, now, what can we give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's several of those boys' nightgowns ready tacked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>said Miss
Dickinson, who was stitching at a boy's nightgown. <div class="bookquote">``Here's one
half-finished,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) picked up an inchoate garment from the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Miss Tellwright wouldn't mind finishing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will do my best at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/>The thoughtless girl had arrived at the sewing meeting without needles
or thimble or scissors, but one lady or another supplied these
deficiencies, and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was at work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stitched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) best and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
hardest, with head bent, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wits concentrated on the task.
Most of the others seemed to be doing likewise, though not to the
detriment of conversation. Beatrice sank down on a stool near her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
mother, and, threading a needle with coloured silk, took up a long
piece of elaborate embroidery.

<p/>The general subjects of talk were the Revival, now over, with a superb
record of seventy saved souls, the school-treat shortly to occur, the
summer holidays, the fashions, and the change of ministers which would
take place in August. The talkers were the wives and daughters of
tradesmen and small manufacturers, together with a few girls of a
somewhat lower status, employed in shops: it was for the sake of these
latter that the sewing meeting was always fixed for the weekly
half-holiday. The splendour of Mrs. Sutton's drawing-room was a little
dazzling to most of the guests, and Mrs. Sutton herself seemed scarcely
of a piece with it. The fact was that the luxury of the abode was
mainly due to Alderman Sutton's inability to refuse anything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
daughter, whose tastes lay in the direction of rich draperies, large or
quaint chairs, occasional tables, dwarf screens, hand-painted mirrors,
and an opulence of bric-à-brac. The hand of Beatrice might be
perceived everywhere, even in the position of the piano, whose back,
adorned with carelessly-flung silks and photographs, was turned away
from the wall. The pictures on the walls had been acquired gradually
by Mr. Sutton at auction sales: it was commonly held that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had an
excellent taste in pictures, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) daughter's aptitude for the
arts came from him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), and not from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother. The gilt clock and side
pieces on the mantelpiece were also peculiarly Mr. Sutton's, having
been publicly presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) by the directors of a local building
society of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had been chairman for many years.

<p/>Less intimidated by all this unexampled luxury than she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was reassured
by the atmosphere of combined and homely effort, the lowliness of
several of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) companions, and the kind, simple face of Mrs. Sutton,
Anna quickly began to feel at ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) paused in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) work, and,
glancing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), happened to catch the eye of Miss Dickinson, who
offered a remark about the weather. Miss Dickinson was head-assistant
at a draper's in St. Luke's Square, and a pillar of the Sunday-school,
which Sunday by Sunday and year by year had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) develop from a
rosy-cheeked girl into a confirmed spinster with sallow and warted
face. Miss Dickinson supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) mother, and was a pattern to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>)
sex. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) was lovable, but had never been loved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) would have made
an admirable wife and mother, but fate had decided that this material
was to be wasted. Miss Dickinson found compensation for the rigour of
destiny in gossip, as innocent as indiscreet. It was said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) had
a tongue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>said Miss Dickinson, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) contralto voice to a
confidential tone, `that you are going into partnership with Mr.
Mynors, Miss Tellwright.''

<p/>The suddenness of the attack took Anna by surprise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) first
defensive impulse was boldly to deny the statement, or at the least to
say that it was premature. A fortnight ago, under similar
circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would not have hesitated to do so. But for more
than a week Anna had been `leading a new life,'' which chiefly meant a
meticulous avoidance of the sins of speech. Never to deviate from the
truth, never to utter an unkind or a thoughtless word, under whatever
provocation: these were two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) self-imposed rules. ``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
answered Miss Dickinson, <div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather a novelty, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson smiled amiably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``It's only a business arrangement; father
arranged it. Really I have nothing to do with it, and I had no idea
that people were talking about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Of course _I_ should never breathe a syllable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson
said with emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``I make a practice of never talking about other
people's affairs. I always find that best, don't you? But I happened
to hear it mentioned in the shop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very funny how things get abroad, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson concurred. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors hasn't been to
our sewing meetings for quite a long time, but I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'ll turn up
to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna took thought. <div class="bookquote">``Is this a sort of special meeting, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, not at all. But we all of us said just now, while you were
upstairs, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would be sure to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson's features,
skilled in innuendo, conveyed that which was too delicate for
utterance. Anna said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see a good deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) at your house, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson
continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) comes sometimes to see father on business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied sharply,
breaking one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rules.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Of course I meant that. You didn't suppose I meant anything
else, did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson smiled pleasantly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) was thirty-five
years of age. Twenty of those years she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) had passed in a desolating
routine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) had existed in the midst of life and never lived; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) knew
no finer joy than that which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) at that moment experienced.

<p/>Again Anna offered no reply. The door opened, and every eye was
centred on the stately Mrs. Clayton Vernon, who, with Mrs. Banks, the
minister's wife, was in charge of the other half of the sewing party in
the dining-room. Mrs. Clayton Vernon had heroic proportions, a nose
which everyone admitted to be aristocratic, exquisite tact, and the
calm consciousness of social superiority. In Bursley she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) was a great
lady: her (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) instincts were those of a great lady; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) would have been
a great lady no matter to what sphere her (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) God had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) had
abundant white hair, and wore a flowered purple silk, in the antique
taste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beatrice, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) began, `you have deserted us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I, Mrs. Vernon?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl answered with involuntary deference.
<div class="bookquote">``I was just coming in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am sent as a deputation from the other room to ask you to sing
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very busy, Mrs. Vernon. I shall never get this mantel-cloth
finished in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall all work better for a little music,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Clayton Vernon/Mrs. Vernon</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Clayton Vernon
urged. <div class="bookquote">``Your voice is a precious gift, and should be used for the
benefit of all. We entreat, my dear girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>Beatrice arose from the footstool and dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) embroidery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Clayton Vernon/Mrs. Vernon</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Clayton Vernon. <div class="bookquote">``If both doors are left open we
shall hear nicely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice asked.

<p/>``I once heard you sing ``Nazareth,<div class="bookquote">'' and I shall never forget it. Sing
that. It will do us all good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Clayton Vernon/Mrs. Vernon</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Clayton Vernon departed with the large movement of an argosy, and
Beatrice sat down to the piano and removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) bracelets. <div class="bookquote">``The
accompaniment is simply frightful towards the end,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said, looking
at Anna with a grimace. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse mistakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>During the song, Mrs. Sutton beckoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) finger to Anna to come
and occupy the stool vacated by Beatrice. Glad to leave the vicinity
of Miss Dickinson, Anna obeyed, creeping on tiptoe across the
intervening space. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I would like to have you near me, my
dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whispered maternally. When Beatrice had sung the song and
somehow executed that accompaniment which has terrorised whole
multitudes of drawing-room pianists, there was a great deal of applause
from both rooms. Mrs. Sutton bent down and whispered in Anna's ear:
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice has been very well trained, has it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna
replied. But, though ``Nazareth' had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wonderful, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
neither understood it nor enjoyed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tried to like it, but the
effect of it on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bizarre rather than pleasing.

<p/>Shortly after half-past five the gong sounded for tea, and the ladies,
bidden by Mrs. Sutton, unanimously thronged into the hall and towards a
room at the back of the house. Beatrice came and took Anna by the arm.
As they were crossing the hall there was a ring at the door. <div class="bookquote">``There's
father--and Mr. Banks, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice exclaimed, opening to them.
Everyone in the vicinity, animated suddenly by this appearance of the
male sex, turned with welcoming smiles. <div class="bookquote">``A greeting to you all,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>the
minister ejaculated with formal suavity as he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) removed his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) low hat. The
Alderman beamed a rather absent-minded goodwill on the entire company,
and said: <div class="bookquote">``Well! I see we're just in time for tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Alderman</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) kissed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) accepted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) hat and stick. <div class="bookquote">``Miss
Tellwright, pa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said, drawing Anna forward: he (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) shook hands
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) heartily, emerging for a moment from the benignant dream in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) seemed usually to exist.

<p/>That air of being rapt by some inward vision, common in very old men,
probably signified nothing in the case of William Sutton: it was a
habitual pose into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had perhaps unconsciously fallen. But
people connected it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) humble archæological, geological, and
zoological hobbies, which had sprung from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) membership of the Five
Towns Field Club, and which most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) acquaintances regarded with
amiable secret disdain. At a school-treat once, held at a popular
rural resort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had taken some of the teachers to a cave, and pointing
out the wave-like formation of its roof had told them that this
peculiar phenomenon had actually been caused by waves of the sea. The
discovery, valid enough and perfectly substantiated by an inquiry into
the levels, was extremely creditable to the amateur geologist, but it
seriously impaired his (<font color='blue'><b>geologist</b></font>) reputation among the Wesleyan community as a
shrewd man of the world. Few believed the statement, or even tried to
believe it, and nearly all thenceforth looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>geologist</b></font>) as a man who must
be humoured in his (<font color='blue'><b>geologist</b></font>) harmless hallucinations and inexplicable
curiosities. On the other hand, the collection of arrowheads, Roman
pottery, fossils and birds' eggs which he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) had given to the Museum in
the Wedgwood Institution was always viewed with municipal pride.

<p/>The tea-room opened by a large French window into a conservatory, and a
table was laid down the whole length of the room and the conservatory.
Mr. Sutton sat at one end and the minister at the other, but neither
Mrs. Sutton nor Beatrice occupied a distinctive place. The ancient
clumsy custom of having tea-urns on the table itself had been abolished
by Beatrice, who had read in a paper that carving was now never done at
table, but by a neatly-dressed parlour-maid at the sideboard.
Consequently the tea-urns were exiled to the sideboard, and the tea
dispensed by a couple of maids. Thus, as Beatrice had explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
mother, the hostess was left free to devote herself to the social arts.
The board was richly spread with fancy breads and cakes, jams of Mrs.
Sutton's own celebrated preserving, diverse sandwiches compiled by
Beatrice, and one or two large examples of the famous Bursley pork-pie.
Numerous as the company was, several chairs remained empty after
everyone was seated. Anna found herself again next to Miss Dickinson,
and five places from the minister, in the conservatory. Beatrice and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother were higher up, in the room. Grace was sung, by request of
Mrs. Sutton. At first, silence prevailed among the guests, and the
inquiries of the maids about milk and sugar were almost painfully
audible. Then Mr. Banks, glancing up the long vista of the table and
pretending to descry some object in the distance, called out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Worthy host, I doubt not you are there, but I can only see you with
the eye of faith.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banks</b></font>)</div><p/>At this all laughed, and a natural ease was established. The minister
and Mrs. Clayton Vernon, who sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) right, exchanged badinage on
the merits and demerits of pork-pies, and their neighbours formed an
appreciative audience. Then there was a sharp ring at the front door,
and one of the maids went out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson whispered to Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>asked Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) would come to-day--Mr. Mynors, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who can that be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton's voice was heard from the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it's Henry, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice answered.

<p/>Mynors entered, joyous and self-possessed, a white rose in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) coat: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Sutton, sent a greeting down the table to
Mr. Banks and Mrs. Clayton Vernon, and offered a general apology for
being late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>), sharply, indicating a chair between
Mrs. Banks and herself. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Banks has a word to say to you about the
singing of that anthem last Sunday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors made some laughing rejoinder, and the voices sank so that Anna
could not catch what was said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a new frock that Miss Sutton is wearing to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson
remarked in an undertone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It looks new,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum! Yes. It was made at Brunt's at Hanbridge. It's quite the
fashion to go there now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>said Miss Dickinson, and added, almost
inaudibly, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'s put it on for Mr. Mynors. You saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) saved that
chair for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you know they were engaged once?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dickinson</b></font>)</div>Miss Dickinson resumed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least people said they were. It was all over the town--oh! let me
see, three years ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/>During the rest of the meal she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said little. On some natures Miss
Dickinson's gossip had the effect of bringing them to silence. Anna
had not seen Mynors since the previous Sunday, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
apparently unperceived by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) talked gaily with Beatrice and Mrs.
Banks: that group was a centre of animation. Anna envied their ease of
manner, their smooth and sparkling flow of conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had the
sensation of feeling vulgar, clumsy, tongue-tied; Mynors and Beatrice
possessed something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would never possess. So they had been
engaged! But had they? Or was it an idle rumour, manufactured by one
who spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) life in such creations? Anna was conscious of
misgivings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had despised Beatrice once, but now it seemed that
after all Beatrice was the natural equal of Henry Mynors. Was it more
likely that Mynors or she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), Anna, should be mistaken in Beatrice? That
Beatrice had generous instincts she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was sure. Anna lost confidence in
herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt humbled, out-of-place, and shamed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If our hostess and the company will kindly excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the
minister with a pompous air, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) watch, <div class="bookquote">``I must go. I have
an important appointment, or an appointment which some people think is
important.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) got up and made various adieux. The elaborate meal, complex with
fifty dainties each of which had to be savoured, was not nearly over.
The parson stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) course up the room to speak with Mrs. Sutton.
After he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) had shaken hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) caught the admired violet eyes
of his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) slim wife, a lady of independent fortune whom the wives of
circuit stewards found it difficult to please in the matter of
furniture, and who despite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forty years still kept something of the
pose of a spoiled beauty. As a minister's spouse this languishing but
impeccable and invariably correct dame was unique even in the
experience of Mrs. Clayton Vernon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you not be home early, Rex?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) asked in the tone of a young
wife lounging amid the delicate odours of a boudoir.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) replied with the stern fixity of a histrionic martyr,
`did you ever know me have a free evening?''

<p/>The Alderman accompanied his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) pastor to the door.

<p/>After tea, Mynors was one of the first to leave the room, and Anna one
of the last, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in the hall, on the way back to the
drawing-room, and asked how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was, and how Agnes was, with such
deference and sincerity of regard for herself and everything that was
hers that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not fail to be impressed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sense of humiliation
and of uncertainty was effaced by a single word, a single glance.
Uplifted by a delicious reassurance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed into the drawing-room,
expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to follow: strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) did not do so. Work was
resumed, but with less ardour than before. It was in fact impossible
to be strenuously diligent after one of Mrs. Sutton's teas, and in
every heart, save those which beat over the most perfect and vigorous
digestive organs, there was a feeling of repentance. The
building-society's clock on the mantel-piece intoned seven: all
expressed surprise at the lateness of the hour, and Mrs. Clayton
Vernon, pleading fatigue after her (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) recent indisposition, quietly
departed. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vernon</b></font>) was gone, Anna said to Mrs. Sutton that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
too must go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be needed at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! In that case-- I will come upstairs with you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Sutton.

<p/>When they were in the bedroom, Mrs. Sutton suddenly clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``How is it with you, dear Anna?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said, gazing anxiously into the
girl's eyes. Anna knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) meant, but made no answer. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
well?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the earnest old woman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I am trying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sutton kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) almost passionately. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
exclaimed with an impulsive gesture, ``I am glad, so glad. I did so
want to have a word with you. You must ``lean hard,'' as Miss Havergal
says. ``Lean hard<div class="bookquote">'' on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). Do not be afraid.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And then, changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
tone: <div class="bookquote">``You are looking pale, Anna. You want a holiday. We shall be
going to the Isle of Man in August or September. Would your father let
you come with us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would not.
Nevertheless the suggestion gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) much pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must see about that later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, and they went
downstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say good-bye to Beatrice. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said in the
hall. One of the servants directed them to the dining-room. The
Alderman and Henry Mynors were looking together at a large photogravure
of Sant's <div class="bookquote">``The Soul's Awakening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>which Mr. Sutton had recently bought,
and Beatrice was exhibiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) embroidery to a group of ladies: sundry
stitchers were scattered about, including Miss Dickinson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great picture--a picture that makes you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry was
saying, seriously, and the Alderman, feeling as the artist might have
felt, was obviously flattered by this sagacious praise.

<p/>Anna said good-night to Miss Dickinson and then to Beatrice. Mynors,
hearing the words, turned round. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I must go. Good evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>)
said suddenly to the astonished Alderman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>the latter inquired, scarcely pleased to find that Mynors
could tear himself away from the picture with so little difficulty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr. Mynors,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I may I will walk down with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors imperturbably answered.

<p/>It was one of those dramatic moments which arrive without the slightest
warning. The gleam of joyous satisfaction in Miss Dickinson's eyes
showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dickinson</b></font>) alone had foreseen this declaration. For a declaration
it was, and a formal declaration. Mynors stood there calm, confident
with masculine superiority, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) glance seemed to say to those
swiftly alert women, whose faces could not disguise a thrilling
excitation: <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Let all know that I, Henry Mynors, the desired of
all, am honourably captive to this shy and perfect creature who is
blushing because I have said what I have said.''  (<font color='red'><b>those women</b></font>)</div>Even the Alderman
forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) photogravure. Beatrice hurriedly resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) explanation of
the embroidery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you like the sewing meeting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors asked Anna when they were
on the pavement.

<p/>Anna paused. <div class="bookquote">``I think Mrs. Sutton is simply a splendid woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
said enthusiastically.

<p/>When, in a moment far too short, they reached Tellwright's house,
Mynors, obeying a mutual wish to which neither had given expression,
followed Anna up the side entry, and so into the yard, where they
lingered for a few seconds. Old Tellwright could be seen at the
extremity of the long narrow garden--a garden which consisted chiefly
of a grass-plot sown with clothes-props and a narrow bordering of
flower beds without flowers. Agnes was invisible. The kitchen-door
stood ajar, and as this was the sole means of ingress from the yard
Anna, humming an air, pushed it open and entered, Mynors in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wake.
They stood on the threshold, happy, hesitating, confused, and looked at
the kitchen as at something which they had not seen before. Anna's
kitchen was the only satisfactory apartment in the house. Its
furniture included a dresser of the simple and dignified kind which is
now assiduously collected by amateurs of old oak. It had four long
narrow shelves holding plates and saucers; the cups were hung in a row
on small brass hooks screwed into the fronts of the shelves. Below the
shelves were three drawers in a line, with brass handles, and below the
drawers was a large recess which held stone jars, a copper
preserving-saucepan, and other receptacles. Seventy years of
continuous polishing by a dynasty of priestesses of cleanliness had
given to this dresser a rich ripe tone which the cleverest
trade-trickster could not have imitated. In it was reflected the
conscientious labour of generations. It had a soft and assuaged
appearance, as though it had never been new and could never have been
new. All its corners and edges had long lost the asperities of
manufacture, and its smooth surfaces were marked by slight hollows
similar in spirit to those worn by the naked feet of pilgrims into the
marble steps of a shrine. The flat portion over the drawers was
scarred with hundreds of scratches, and yet even all these seemed to be
incredibly ancient, and in some distant past to have partaken of the
mellowness of the whole. The dark woodwork formed an admirable
background for the crockery on the shelves, and a few of the old
plates, hand-painted according to some vanished secret in pigments
which time could only improve, had the look of relationship by birth to
the dresser. There must still be thousands of exactly similar dressers
in the kitchens of the people, but they are gradually being transferred
to the dining rooms of curiosity-hunters. To Anna this piece of
furniture, which would have made the most taciturn collector vocal with
joy, was merely `the dresser.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had always lamented that it
contained no cupboard. In front of the fireless range was an old steel
kitchen fender with heavy fire-irons. It had in the middle of its flat
top a circular lodgment for saucepans, but on this polished disc no
saucepan was ever placed. The fender was perhaps as old as the
dresser, and the profound depths of its polish served to mitigate
somewhat the newness of the patent coal-economising range which
Tellwright had had put in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) took the house. On the high
mantelpiece were four tall brass candlesticks which, like the dresser,
were silently awaiting their apotheosis at the hands of some collector.
Beside these were two or three common mustard tins, polished to
counterfeit silver, containing spices; also an abandoned coffee-mill
and two flat-irons. A grandfather's clock of oak to match the dresser
stood to the left of the fireplace; it had a very large white dial with
a grinning face in the centre. Though it would only run for
twenty-four hours, its leisured movement seemed to have the certainty
of a natural law, especially to Agnes, for Mr. Tellwright never forgot
to wind it before going to bed. Under the window was a plain deal
table, with white top and stained legs. Two Windsor chairs completed
the catalogue of furniture. The glistening floor was of red and black
tiles, and in front of the fender lay a list hearthrug made by
attaching innumerable bits of black cloth to a canvas base. On the
painted walls were several grocers' almanacs, depicting sailors in the
arms of lovers, children crossing brooks, or monks swelling themselves
with Gargantuan repasts. Everything in this kitchen was absolutely
bright and spotless, as clean as a cat in pattens, except the ceiling,
darkened by fumes of gas. Everything was in perfect order, and had the
humanised air of use and occupation which nothing but use and
occupation can impart to senseless objects. It was a kitchen where, in
the housewife's phrase, you might eat off the floor, and to any Bursley
matron it would have constituted the highest possible certificate of
Anna's character, not only as housewife but as elder sister--for in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
absence Agnes had washed the tea-things and put them away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the nicest room, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mynors at length.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna smiled, incapable of course of seeing the
place with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean there is nothing to beat a clean, straight kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors
replied, `and there never will be. It wants only the mistress in a
white apron to make it complete. Do you know, when I came in here the
other night, and you were sitting at the table there, I thought the
place was like a picture.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How funny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, puzzled but well satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``But won't you
come into the parlour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Persian</b></font>)</div><p/>The Persian with one ear met them in the lobby, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tail flying, but
cautiously sidled upstairs at sight of Mynors. When Anna opened the
door of the parlour she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw Agnes seated at the table over her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) lessons,
frowning and preoccupied. Tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter, Agnes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child crossly. <div class="bookquote">``Don't bother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what's the matter? You're crying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``No, I'm not. I'm doing my sums, and I can't get it--can't--' The
child burst into tears just as Mynors entered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) presence was a
complete surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) pinafore, ashamed to
be thus caught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``Where is this sum that won't come right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) picked up the slate and examined it while Agnes was finding herself
again. <div class="bookquote">``Practice!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Has Agnes got as far as practice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) an instant's glance and murmured <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) could
shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>). Anna was enchanted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) manner,
and as for Agnes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) surrendered happily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) worked
the sum, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) copied the figures into her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) exercise-book. Anna sat
and watched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely you'll stay and see father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna urged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. I really had not meant to call. Good-night, Agnes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In a moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was gone out of the room and the house. It was as if, in obedience
to a sudden impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had forcibly torn himself away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ at the sewing meeting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes asked, adding in parenthesis,
<div class="bookquote">``I never dreamt he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was here, and I was frightfully vexed. I felt such
a baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came for tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) call here like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I tell?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said. The child looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's awfully queer, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me all about
the sewing meeting. Did they have cakes or was it a plain tea? And
did you go into Beatrice Sutton's bedroom?''




 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/>ON THE BANK

<p/>Anna began to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) July interest and dividends. During a
fortnight remittances, varying from a few pounds to a few hundred of
pounds, arrived by post almost daily. They were all addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>),
since the securities now stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own name; and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), under the
miser's superintendence, fell the new task of entering them in a book
and paying them into the Bank. This mysterious begetting of money by
money--a strange process continually going forward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) benefit, in
various parts of the world, far and near, by means of activities of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was completely ignorant and would always be completely
ignorant--bewildered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a feeling of its unreality. The
elaborate mechanism by which capital yields interest without suffering
diminution from its original bulk is one of the commonest phenomena of
modern life, and one of the least understood. Many capitalists never
grasp it, nor experience the slightest curiosity about it until the
mechanism through some defect ceases to revolve. Tellwright was of
these; for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) the interval between the outlay of capital and the
receipt of interest was nothing but an efflux of time: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) planted
capital as a gardener plants rhubarb, tolerably certain of a particular
result, but not dwelling even in thought on that which is hidden. The
productivity of capital was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) the greatest achievement of social
progress--indeed, the social organism justified its existence by that
achievement; nothing could be more equitable than this productivity,
nothing more natural. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) would as soon have inquired into it as Agnes
would have inquired into the ticking of the grandfather's clock. But
to Anna, who had some imagination, and whose imagination had been
stirred by recent events, the arrival of moneys out of space, unearned,
unasked, was a disturbing experience, affecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as a conjuring
trick affects a child, whose sensations hesitate between pleasure and
apprehension. Practically, Anna could not believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was rich;
and in fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not rich--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was merely a fixed point through
which moneys that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was unable to arrest passed with the rapidity of
trains. If money is a token, Anna was denied the satisfaction of
fingering even the token: drafts and cheques were all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) touched
-LRB-touched only to abandon-RRB---the doubly tantalising and insubstantial
tokens of a token. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to test the actuality of this apparent
dream by handling coin and causing it to vanish over counters and into
the palms of the necessitous. And moreover, quite apart from this
curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) really needed money for pressing requirements of Agnes
and herself. They had yet had no new summer clothes, and Whitsuntide,
the time prescribed by custom for the refurnishing of wardrobes, was
long since past. The intercourse with Henry Mynors, the visit to the
Suttons, had revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) more plainly than ever the intolerable
shortcomings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wardrobe, and similar imperfections. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was more
painfully awake to these, and yet, by an unhappy paradox, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was even
less in a position to remedy them, than in previous years. For now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own fortune; to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's bounty was
therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) divined, a sure way of inviting a rebuff. But, even if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had dared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might not use the income that was privately hers,
for was not every penny of it already allocated to the partnership with
Mynors! So it happened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) never once mentioned the matter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lacked the courage, since by whatever avenue she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) approached
it circumstances would add an illogical and adventitious force to the
brutal snubs which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) invariably dealt out when petitioned for money.
To demand his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money, having fifty thousand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own! To spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
own in the face of that agreement with Mynors! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could too easily
guess his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bitter and humiliating retorts to either proposition, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
kept silence, comforting herself with timid visions of a far distant
future. The balance at the bank crept up to sixteen hundred pounds.
The deed of partnership was drawn; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father pored over the blue
draft, and several times Mynors called and the two men discussed it
together. Then one morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) into the front
parlour, and handed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a piece of parchment on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dimly
deciphered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own name coupled with that of Henry Mynors, in large
letters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mun sign, seal, and deliver this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, putting a pen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sat down obediently to write, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) with a scornful
gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou `lt sign blind then, eh? Just like a woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I left it to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Left it to me! Read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read through the deed, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had accomplished the feat one
fact only stood clear in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind, that the partnership was for seven
years, a period extensible by consent of both parties to fourteen or
twenty-one years. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) affixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) signature, the pen moving
awkwardly over the rough surface of the parchment.

<p/>``Now put thy finger on that bit o' wax, and say; <div class="bookquote">``I deliver this as my
act and deed.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I deliver this as my act and deed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man signed as witness. <div class="bookquote">``Soon as I give this to Lawyer Dane,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) remarked, `thou`rt bound, willy-nilly. Law's law, and thou`rt
bound.''

<p/>On the following day she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had to sign a cheque which reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
bank-balance to about three pounds. Perhaps it was the knowledge of
this reduction that led Ephraim Tellwright to resume at once and with
fresh rigour his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) new policy of `squeezing the last penny' out of Titus
Price -LRB-despite the fact that the latter had already achieved the
incredible by paying thirty pounds in little more than a month-RRB-, thus
causing the catastrophe which soon afterwards befell. What methods her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father was adopting Anna did not know, since he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said no word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
about the matter: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) only knew that Agnes had twice been dispatched
with notes to Edward Street. One day, about noon, a clay-soiled urchin
brought a letter addressed to herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) guessed that it was some
appeal for mercy from the Prices, and wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father had been
at home. The old man was away for the whole day, attending a sale of
property at Axe, the agricultural town in the north of the county,
locally styled `the metropolis of the moorlands.'' Anna read:--<div class="bookquote">``My dear
Miss Tellwright,--Now that our partnership is an accomplished fact,
will you not come and look over the works? I should much like you to
do so. I shall be passing your house this afternoon about two, and
will call on the chance of being able to take you down with me to the
works. If you are unable to come no harm will be done, and some other
day can be arranged; but of course I shall be disappointed.--Believe
me, yours most sincerely, HY. MYNORS.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was charmed with the idea--to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) so audacious--and relieved that
the note was not after all from Titus or Willie Price: but again she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had to regret that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father was not at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be capable of
thinking and saying that the projected expedition was a truancy,
contrived to occur in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might grumble at the house being
left without a keeper. Moreover, according to a tacit law, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) never
departed from the fixed routine of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) existence without first
obtaining Ephraim's approval, or at least being sure that such a
departure would not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) violently angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered whether
Mynors knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father was away, and, if so, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had chosen
that afternoon purposely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not care that Mynors should call for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)--it made the visit seem so formal; and as in order to reach the
works, down at Shawport by the canal-side, they would necessarily go
through the middle of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) foresaw infinite gossip and rumour
as one result. Already, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew, the names of herself and Mynors were
everywhere coupled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not even enter a shop without being
made aware, more or less delicately, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was an object of piquant
curiosity. A woman is profoundly interesting to women at two periods
only--before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is betrothed and before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becomes the mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
firstborn. Anna was in the first period; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life did not comprise the
second. When Agnes came home to dinner from school, Anna said nothing
of Mynors' note until they had begun to wash up the dinner-things, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) suggested that Agnes should finish this operation alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, ever compliant. <div class="bookquote">``But why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going out, and I must get ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going out? And shall you leave the house all empty? What will father
say? Where are you going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>Agnes's tendency to anticipate the worst, and never to blink their
father's tyranny, always annoyed Anna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered rather curtly:
<div class="bookquote">``I'm going to the works--Mr. Mynors' works. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s sent word he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) wants me
to.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) despised herself for wishing to hide anything, and added, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
will call here for me about two o<div class="bookquote">``clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors! How splendid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>And then Agnes's face fell somewhat. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) won't call before two? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) doesn't, I shall be gone to
school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! I don't want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). But--I suppose you'll be out a long
time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'ll bring you back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) won't, you silly girl. And I shan't be out long. I
shall be back for tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna ran upstairs to dress. At ten minutes to two she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was ready.
Agnes usually left at a quarter to two, but the child had not yet gone.
At five minutes to two, Anna called downstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) meant to depart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm just going now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes shouted back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) opened the front door
and then returned to the foot of the stairs. <div class="bookquote">``Anna, if I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) down
the road shall I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) you're ready waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. Whatever are you dreaming of?''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>the elder sister
reproved. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) isn't coming from the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! All right. Good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>And the child at last went.

<p/>It was something after two--every siren and hooter had long since
finished the summons to work--when Mynors rang the bell. Anna was
still upstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) examined herself in the glass, and then descended
slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I see you are ready to come. I'm very
glad. I hope I haven't inconvenienced you, but just this afternoon
seemed to be a good opportunity for you to see the works, and, you
know, you ought to see it. Father in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall leave the house to take care of itself. Do
you want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not specially,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I think we have settled everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) banged the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and they started. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) held open the
gate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not ignore the look of passionate
admiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) face. It was a look disconcerting by its mere
intensity. The man could control his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue, but not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
demeanour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) viewed it, aggravated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) self-consciousness as they
braved the streets. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perturbation. When they
reached Duck Bank, Mynors asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whether they should go through the
market-place or along King Street, by the bottom of St. Luke's Square.
<div class="bookquote">``By the market-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. The shop where Miss Dickinson was
employed was at the bottom of St. Luke's Square, and all the eyes of
the marketplace was preferable to the chance of those eyes.


<p/>Probably no one in the Five Towns takes a conscious pride in the
antiquity of the potter's craft, nor in its unique and intimate
relation to human life, alike civilised and uncivilised. Man hardened
clay into a bowl before he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) spun flax and made a garment, and the last
lone man will want an earthen vessel after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ruined
house for a cave, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woven rags for an animal's skin. This
supremacy of the most ancient of crafts is in the secret nature of
things, and cannot be explained. History begins long after the period
when Bursley was first the central seat of that honoured manufacture:
it is the central seat still--`the mother of the Five Towns,'' in our
local phrase--and though the townsmen, absorbed in a strenuous daily
struggle, may forget their heirship to an unbroken tradition of
countless centuries, the seal of their venerable calling is upon their
foreheads. If no other relic of an immemorial past is to be seen in
these modernised sordid streets, there is at least the living legacy of
that extraordinary kinship between workman and work, that instinctive
mastery of clay which the past has bestowed upon the present. The
horse is less to the Arab than clay is to the Bursley man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exists
in it and by it; it fills his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lungs and blanches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek; it keeps
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alive and it kills him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers close round it as round the
hand of a friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows all its tricks and aptitudes; when to coax
and when to force it, when to rely on it and when to distrust it. The
weavers of Lancashire have dubbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an obscene epithet on
account of it, an epithet whose hasty use has led to many a fight, but
nothing could be more illuminatively descriptive than that epithet,
which names his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vocation in terms of another vocation. A dozen decades
of applied science have of course resulted in the interposition of
elaborate machinery between the clay and the man; but no great vulgar
handicraft has lost less of the human than potting. Clay is always
clay, and the steam-driven contrivance that will mould a basin while a
man sits and watches has yet to be invented. Moreover, if in some
coarser process the hands are superseded, the number of processes has
been multiplied tenfold: the ware in which six men formerly
collaborated is now produced by sixty; and thus, in one sense, the
touch of finger on clay is more pervasive than ever before.

<p/>Mynors' works was acknowledged to be one of the best, of its size, in
the district--a model three-oven bank, and it must be remembered that
of the hundreds of banks in the Five Towns the vast majority are small,
like this: the large manufactory with its corps of jacket-men,-LSB-1-RSB- one
of whom is detached to show visitors round so much of the works as is
deemed advisable for them to see, is the exception. Mynors paid three
hundred pounds a year in rent, and produced nearly three hundred pounds
worth of work a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own manager, and there was only one
jacket-man on the place, a clerk at eighteen shillings. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) employed
about a hundred hands, and devoted all his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) ingenuity to prevent that
wastage which is at once the easiest to overlook and the most difficult
to check, the wastage of labour. No pains were spared to keep all
departments in full and regular activity, and owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) judicious
firmness the feast of St. Monday, that canker eternally eating at the
root of the prosperity of the Five Towns, was less religiously observed
on his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) bank than perhaps anywhere else in Bursley. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had realised
that when a workshop stands empty the employer has not only ceased to
make money, but has begun to lose it. The architect of ``Providence
Works' -LRB-Providence stands godfather to many commercial enterprises in
the Five Towns-RRB- knew his (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) business and the business of the potter, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) had designed the works with a view to the strictest economy of
labour. The various shops were so arranged that in the course of its
metamorphosis the clay travelled naturally in a circle from the
slip-house by the canal to the packing-house by the canal: there was no
carrying to and fro. The steam installation was complete: steam once
generated had no respite; after it had exhausted itself in vitalising
fifty machines, it was killed by inches in order to dry the unfired
ware and warm the dinners of the workpeople.

<p/>Henry took Anna to the canal-entrance, because the buildings looked
best from that side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now how much is a crate worth?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) asked, pointing to a crate which
was being swung on a crane direct from the packing-house into a boat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors answered. <div class="bookquote">``A crateful of ware may be worth anything.
At Minton's I have seen a crate worth three hundred pounds. But that
one there is only worth eight or nine pounds. You see you and I make
cheap stuff.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But don't you make any really good pots--are they all cheap?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All cheap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's business?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) detected a note of regret in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) said, with the slightest impatient warmth. <div class="bookquote">``We make
the stuff as good as we can for the money. We supply what everyone
wants. Don't you think it's better to please a thousand folks than to
please ten? I like to feel that my ware is used all over the country
and the colonies. I would sooner do as I do than make swagger ware for
a handful of rich people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) exclaimed, eagerly accepting the point of view, <div class="bookquote">``I quite
agree with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) in that vein before, and was
struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) enthusiasm. And Mynors was in fact always very
enthusiastic concerning the virtues of the general markets. He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) had no
sympathy with specialities, artistic or otherwise. He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>)
satisfaction in honestly meeting the public taste. He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was born to be a
manufacturer of cheap goods on a colossal scale. He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) could dream of
fifty ovens, and his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) ambition blinded him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) to the present absurdity of
talking about a three-oven bank spreading its productions all over the
country and the colonies; it did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) that there were yet
scarcely enough plates to go round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we had better start at the start,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) said, leading the way
to the slip-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) did not need to be told that Anna was perfectly
ignorant of the craft of pottery, and that every detail of it, so stale
to him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>), would acquire freshness under her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) naïve and inquiring gaze.

<p/>In the slip-house begins the long manipulation which transforms raw
porous friable clay into the moulded, decorated and glazed vessel. The
large whitewashed place was occupied by ungainly machines and
receptacles through which the four sorts of clay used in the common
`body'--ball clay, China clay, flint clay and stone clay--were
compelled to pass before they became a white putty-like mixture meet
for shaping by human hands. The blunger crushed the clay, the sifter
extracted the iron from it by means of a magnet, the press expelled the
water, and the pug-mill expelled the air. From the last reluctant
mouth slowly emerged a solid stream nearly a foot in diameter, like a
huge white snake. Already the clay had acquired the uniformity
characteristic of a manufactured product.

<p/>Anna moved to touch the bolts of the enormous twenty-four-chambered
press.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't stand there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. ``The pressure is tremendous, and if
the thing were to burst--'

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>handful</b></font>) fled hastily. <div class="bookquote">``But isn't it dangerous for the workmen?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Eli Machin, the engineman, the oldest employee on the works, a moneyed
man and the pattern of reliability, allowed a vague smile to flit
across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face at this remark. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ascended from the engine-house
below in order to exhibit the tricks of the various machines, and that
done he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disappeared. Anna was awed by the sensation of being
surrounded by terrific forces always straining for release and held in
check by the power of a single wall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and see a plate made: that is one of the simplest things, and the
batting-machine is worth looking at,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, and they went into
the nearest shop, a hot interior in the shape of four corridors round a
solid square middle. Here men and women were working side by side, the
women subordinate to the men. All were preoccupied, wrapped up in
their respective operations, and there was the sound of irregular
whirring movements from every part of the big room. The air was laden
with whitish dust, and clay was omnipresent--on the floor, the walls,
the benches, the windows, on clothes, hands and faces. It was in this
shop, where both hollow-ware pressers and flat pressers were busy as
only craftsmen on piecework can be busy, that more than anywhere else
clay was to be seen `in the hand of the potter.'' Near the door a stout
man with a good-humoured face flung some clay on to a revolving disc,
and even as Anna passed a jar sprang into existence. One instant the
clay was an amorphous mass, the next it was a vessel perfectly
circular, of a prescribed width and a prescribed depth; the flat and
apparently clumsy fingers of the craftsman had seemed to lose
themselves in the clay for a fraction of time, and the miracle was
accomplished. The man threw these vessels with the rapidity of a Roman
candle throwing off coloured stars, and one woman was kept busy in
supplying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with material and relieving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bench of the finished
articles. Mynors drew Anna along to the batting-machines for plate
makers, at that period rather a novelty and the latest invention of the
dead genius whose brain has reconstituted a whole industry on new
lines. Confronted with a piece of clay, the batting-machine descended
upon it with the ferocity of a wild animal, worried it, stretched it,
smoothed it into the width and thickness of a plate, and then desisted
of itself and waited inactive for the flat presser to remove its victim
to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) more exact shaping machine. Several men were producing plates,
but their rapid labours seemed less astonishing than the preliminary
feat of the batting-machine. All the ware as it was moulded
disappeared into the vast cupboards occupying the centre of the shop,
where Mynors showed Anna innumerable rows of shelves full of pots in
process of steam-drying. Neither time nor space nor material was
wasted in this ant-heap of industry. In order to move to and fro, the
women were compelled to insinuate themselves past the stationary bodies
of the men. Anna marvelled at the careless accuracy with which they
fed the batting-machines with lumps precisely calculated to form a
plate of a given diameter. Everyone exerted himself as though the
salvation of the world hung on the production of so much stuff by a
certain hour; dust, heat, and the presence of a stranger were alike
unheeded in the mad creative passion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors the cicerone firing</b></font>)</div>said Mynors the cicerone, opening another door which gave into
the yard, `when all that stuff is dried and fettled--smoothed, you
know--it goes into the biscuit oven: that's the first firing. There's
the biscuit oven, but we can't inspect it because it's just being
drawn.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cicerone</b></font>) pointed to the oven near by, in whose dark interior the forms of
men, naked to the waist, could dimly be seen struggling with the weight
of saggars-LSB-2-RSB- full of ware. It seemed like some release of martyrs,
this unpacking of the immense oven, which, after being flooded with a
sea of flame for fifty-four hours, had cooled for two days, and was yet
hotter than the Equator. The inertness and pallor of the saggars
seemed to be the physical result of their fiery trial, and one wondered
that they should have survived the trial. Mynors went into the place
adjoining the oven and brought back a plate out of an open saggar; it
was still quite warm. It had the _matt_ surface of a biscuit, and
adhered slightly to the fingers: it was now a `crook'; it had exchanged
malleability for brittleness, and nothing mortal could undo what the
fire had done. Mynors took the plate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to the
biscuit-warehouse, a long room where one was forced to keep to narrow
alleys amid parterres of pots. A solitary biscuit-warehouseman was
examining the ware in order to determine the remuneration of the
pressers.

<p/>They climbed a flight of steps to the printing-shop, where, by means of
copper-plates, printing-presses, mineral colours, and transfer-papers,
most of the decoration was done. The room was filled by a little crowd
of people--oldish men, women and girls, divided into printers, cutters,
transferors and apprentices. Each interminably repeated some trifling
process, and every article passed through a succession of hands until
at length it was washed in a tank and rose dripping therefrom with its
ornament of flowers and scrolls fully revealed. The room smelt of oil
and flannel and humanity; the atmosphere was more languid, more like
that of a family party, than in the pressers' shop: the old women
looked stern and shrewish, the pretty young women pert and defiant, the
younger girls meek. The few men seemed out of place. By what trick
had they crept into the very centre of that mass of femineity? It
seemed wrong, scandalous that they should remain. Contiguous with the
printing-shop was the painting-shop, in which the labours of the former
were taken to a finish by the brush of the paintress, who filled in
outlines with flat colour, and thus converted mechanical printing into
handiwork. The paintresses form the _noblesse_ of the banks. Their
task is a light one, demanding deftness first of all; they have
delicate fingers, and enjoy a general reputation for beauty: the wages
they earn may be estimated from their finery on Sundays. They come to
business in cloth jackets, carry dinner in little satchels; in the shop
they wear white aprons, and look startlingly neat and tidy. Across the
benches over which they bend their coquettish heads gossip flies and
returns like a shuttle; they are the source of a thousand intrigues,
and one or other of them is continually getting married or omitting to
get married. On the bank they constitute `the sex.'' An infinitesimal
proportion of them, from among the branch known as ground-layers, die
of lead-poisoning--a fact which adds pathos to their frivolous charm.
In a subsidiary room off the painting-shop a single girl was seated at
a revolving table actuated by a treadle. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was doing the
`band-and-line' on the rims of saucers. Mynors and Anna watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flicked saucer after saucer into the exact
centre of the table, moved the treadle, and, holding a brush firmly
against the rim of the piece, produced with infallible exactitude the
band and the line. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was a brunette, about twenty-eight: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a
calm, vacuously contemplative face; but God alone knew whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
thought. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) work represented the summit of monotony; the regularity
of it hypnotised the observer, and Mynors himself was impressed by this
stupendous phenomenon of absolute sameness, involuntarily assuming
towards it the attitude of a showman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>handful</b></font>) earns as much as eighteen shillings a week sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>showman</b></font>)
whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I try?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna timidly asked of a sudden, curious to experience what
the trick was like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, in eager assent. <div class="bookquote">``Priscilla, let this lady
have your seat a moment, please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl got up, smiling politely. Anna took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, try on this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, putting on the table the plate which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) still carried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take a full brush,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>the paintress suggested, not attempting to hide
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) amusement at Anna's unaccustomed efforts. <div class="bookquote">``Now push the treadle.
There! It isn't in the middle yet. Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna produced a most creditable band, and a trembling but passable
line, and rose flushed with the small triumph.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have the gift,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors; and the paintress respectfully
applauded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt I could do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna responded. <div class="bookquote">``My mother's mother was a
paintress, and it must be in the blood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors smiled indulgently. They descended again to the ground floor,
and following the course of manufacture came to the `hardening-on'
kiln, a minor oven where for twelve hours the oil is burnt out of the
colour in decorated ware. A huge, jolly man in shirt and trousers,
with an enormous apron, was in the act of drawing the kiln, assisted by
two thin boys. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded a greeting to Mynors and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Warm!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The kiln was nearly emptied. As Anna stopped at the door, the man
addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Step inside, miss, and try it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted, as if despising this hesitation. ``An ounce of
experience--' The two boys grinned and wiped their foreheads with
their bare skeleton-like arms. Anna, challenged by the man's look,
walked quickly into the kiln. A blasting heat seemed to assault her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) on
every side, driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back; it was incredible that any human being
could support such a temperature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the jovial man, apparently summing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) up with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bright, quizzical eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You know summat as you didn't know afore,
miss. Come along, lads,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added with brisk heartiness to the boys,
and the drawing of the kiln proceeded.

<p/>Next came the dipping-house, where a middle-aged woman, enveloped in a
protective garment from head to foot, was dipping jugs into a vat of
lead-glaze, a boy assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The woman's hands were covered with
the grey, slimy glaze. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alone of all the employees appeared to be
cool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the last stage but one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``There is only the
glost-firing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and they passed out into the yard once more. One of the
glost-ovens was empty; they entered it and peered into the lofty inner
chamber, which seemed like the cold crater of an exhausted volcano, or
like a vault, or like the ruined seat of some forgotten activity. The
other oven was firing, and Anna could only look at its exterior,
catching glimpses of the red glow at its twelve mouths, and guess at
the Tophet, within, where the lead was being fused into glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now for the glost-warehouse, and you will have seen all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors,
`except the mould-shop, and that doesn't matter.''

<p/>The warehouse was the largest place on the works, a room sixty-feet
long and twenty broad, low, whitewashed, bare and clean. Piles of ware
occupied the whole of the walls and of the immense floorspace, but
there was no trace here of the soilure and untidiness incident to
manufacture; all processes were at an end, clay had vanished into
crock: and the calmness and the whiteness atoned for the disorder,
noise and squalor which had preceded. Here was a sample of the total
and final achievement towards which the thousands of small, disjointed
efforts that Anna had witnessed, were directed. And it seemed a
miraculous, almost impossible, result; so definite, precise and regular
after a series of acts apparently variable, inexact and casual; so
inhuman after all that intensely inhuman labour; so vast in comparison
with the minuteness of the separate endeavours. As Anna looked, for
instance, at a pile of tea-sets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found it difficult even to
conceive that, a fortnight or so before, they had been nothing but
lumps of dirty clay. No stage of the manufacture was incredible by
itself, but the result was incredible. It was the result that appealed
to the imagination, authenticating the adage that fools and children
should never see anything till it is done.

<p/>Anna pondered over the organising power, the forethought, the wide
vision, and the sheer ingenuity and cleverness which were implied by
the contents of this warehouse. <div class="bookquote">``What brains!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, of Mynors;
`what quantities of all sorts of things he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) must know!'' It was a humble
and deeply-felt admiration.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spoken words gave no clue to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts. <div class="bookquote">``You seem to make a
fine lot of tea-sets,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``These few that you see here are a
special order. I don't go in much for tea-sets: they don't pay; we
lose fifteen per cent. of the pieces in making. It's toilet-ware that
pays, and that is our leading line.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) waved an arm vaguely towards
rows and rows of ewers and basins in the distance. They walked to the
end of the warehouse, glancing at everything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, `isn't that pretty?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) pointed through the
last window to a view of the canal, which could be seen thence in
perspective, finishing in a curve. On one side, close to the water's
edge, was a ruined and fragmentary building, its rich browns reflected
in the smooth surface of the canal. On the other side were a few grim,
grey trees bordering the towpath. Down the vista moved a boat steered
by a woman in a large mob-cap. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't that picturesque?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna assented willingly. <div class="bookquote">``It's really quite strange, such a
scene right in the middle of Bursley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! There are others,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I always take a peep at that
whenever I come into the warehouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you find time to notice it--with all this place to see
after,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It's a splendid works!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will do--to be going on with,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) answered, satisfied. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very
glad you've been down. You must come again. I can see you would be
interested in it, and there are plenty of things you haven't looked at
yet, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). They were alone in the warehouse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I expect so. Well, I must go, at once; I'm afraid
it's very late now. Thank you for showing me round, and explaining,
and--I'm frightfully stupid and ignorant. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Vapid and trite phrases: what unimaginable messages the hearer heard in
you!

<p/>Anna held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) seized it almost convulsively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
incendiary eyes fastened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see you out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, dropping that ungloved hand.

<p/>It was ten o'clock that night before Ephraim Tellwright returned home
from Axe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) appeared to be in a bad temper. Agnes had gone to bed.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) supper of bread-and-cheese and water was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>), and Anna
sat at the table while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) consumed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) ate in silence, somewhat
hungrily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not deem the moment propitious for telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) visit to Mynors' works.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Titus Price sent up?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) asked at length, gulping down the last of
the water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sent up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Art fond, lass? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) mun send up some more o' thy
rent to-day--twenty-five pun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>)'s not sent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said timidly. <div class="bookquote">``I was out this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out, wast?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors sent word to ask me to go down and look over the works; so
I went. I thought it would be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it was`na all right. And I'd like to know what business thou
hast gadding out, as soon as my back's turned. How can I tell whether
Price sent up or not? And what's more, thou know's as th' house hadn't
ought to be left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said pleasantly, with a determination to be meek and
dutiful.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) grunted. <div class="bookquote">``Happen he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) didna' send. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) did, and found th'
house locked up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) should ha' sent again. Bring me th' inkpot, and
I'll write a note as Agnes must take when her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) goes to school to-morrow
morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna obeyed. <div class="bookquote">``They'll never be able to pay twenty-five pounds,
father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ventured. <div class="bookquote">``They've paid thirty already, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Less gab,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said shortly, taking up the pen. <div class="bookquote">``Here--write it
thysen.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) threw the pen towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell Titus if he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) doesn't pay
five-and-twenty this wik, us'll put bailiffs in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it come better from you, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pleaded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose property is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The laconic question was final. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
must obey, and began to write. But, realising that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would perforce
meet both Titus Price and Willie on Sunday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) merely demanded the
money, omitting the threat. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) passed the note
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to read.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will that do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) reply was to tear the paper across. <div class="bookquote">``Put down what I tell ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
ordered, `and don't let's have any more paper wasted.'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
dictated a letter which was an ultimatum in three lines. <div class="bookquote">``Sign it,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) signed it, weeping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could see the wistful reproach in Willie
Price's eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Good-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to tell you I had been to the works, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) final blow, and having delivered it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
loosed the victim. <div class="bookquote">``Go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went upstairs, resolutely read her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) Bible, and resolutely prayed.

<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>THE TREAT

<p/>This surly and terrorising ferocity of Tellwright's was as instinctive
as the growl and spring of a beast of prey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) never considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
attitude towards the women of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) household as an unusual phenomenon
which needed justification, or as being in the least abnormal. The
women of a household were the natural victims of their master: in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
experience it had always been so. In his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) experience the master had
always, by universal consent, possessed certain rights over the
self-respect, the happiness and the peace of the defenceless souls set
under him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)--rights as unquestioned as those exercised by Ivan the
Terrible. Such rights were rooted in the secret nature of things. It
was futile to discuss them, because their necessity and their propriety
were equally obvious. Tellwright would not have been angry with any
man who impugned them: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would merely have regarded the fellow as a
crank and a born fool, on whom logic or indignation would be entirely
wasted. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did as his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) father and uncles had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) still thought of
his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) father as a grim customer, infinitely more redoubtable than
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) really believed that parents spoiled their children
nowadays: to be knocked down by a single blow was one of the
punishments of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own generation. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could recall the fearful
timidity of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) mother's eyes without a trace of compassion. His (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
treatment of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) daughters was no part of a system, nor obedient to any
defined principles, nor the expression of a brutal disposition, nor the
result of gradually-acquired habit. It came to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) like eating, and
like parsimony. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) belonged to the great and powerful class of
house-tyrants, the backbone of the British nation, whose views on
income-tax cause ministries to tremble. If you had talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) of
the domestic graces of life, your words would have conveyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) no
meaning. If you had indicted him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) for simple unprovoked rudeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
would have grinned, well knowing that, as the King can do no wrong, so
a man cannot be rude in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own house. If you had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
inflicted purposeless misery not only on others but on himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
would have grinned again, vaguely aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not tried to be
happy, and rather despising happiness as a sort of childish gewgaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had, in fact, never been happy at home: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never known that
expansion of the spirit which is called joy; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existed continually
under a grievance. The atmosphere of Manor Terrace afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too,
with a melancholy gloom--him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), who had created it. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) been capable
of self-analysis, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have discovered that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart lightened
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the house, and grew dark whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was incapable of the feat. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case, like every similar case, was
irremediable.

<p/>The next morning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preposterous displeasure lay like a curse on the
house; Anna was silent, and Agnes moved on timid feet. In the
afternoon Willie Price called in answer to the note. The miser was in
the garden, and Agnes at school. Willie's craven and fawning humility
was inexpressibly touching and shameful to Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to say to
him (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) stood hesitant and confused in the parlour: <div class="bookquote">``Go in peace.
Forget this despicable rent. It sickens me to see you so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
foresaw, as the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's vindictive pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
tenants, an interminable succession of these mortifying interviews.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're rather hard on us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>Willie Price began, using the old phrases,
but in a tone of forced and propitiatory cheerfulness, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
feared to bring down a storm of anger which should ruin all. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
not deny that we've been doing our best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rent is due, you know, Mr. William,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) replied, blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't deny that. I admit that. I--did
you happen to see Mr. Tellwright's postscript to your letter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered, without thinking.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) drew the letter, soiled and creased, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) pocket, and displayed
it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). At the foot of the page she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) read, in Ephraim's thick and
clumsy characters: <div class="bookquote">``P.S.. This is final.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim characters</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>said Willie, `was a little put about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)'d never
received such a letter before in the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) business career. It
isn't as if--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I needn't tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) interrupted, with a sudden determination to
get to the worst without more suspense, `that of course I am in
father's hands.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Of course, Miss Tellwright; we quite understand that--quite.
It's just a matter of business. We owe a debt and we must pay it. All
we want is time.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smiled piteously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blue eyes full of
appeal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was obliged to gaze at the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, tapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) foot on the rug. <div class="bookquote">``But father means what
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again, trying to soften her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) words by
means of something more subtle than a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>Willie agreed; `and I admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) for it.''

<p/>The obsequious, truckling lie was odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) ventured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said, sincerely. <div class="bookquote">``Father, you're wanted,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
called curtly through the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a proposal to make to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Price</b></font>)</div>Price continued, while they
awaited the presence of the miser, `and I can't hardly think he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)'ll
refuse it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, young sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright said blandly, with an air almost
insinuating, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) entered. Willie Price, the simpleton, was deceived
by it, and, taking courage, adopted another line of defence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
thought the miser was a little ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) postscript.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About your note, Mr. Tellwright; I was just telling Miss Tellwright
that my father said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never received such a letter in the whole of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) business career.''  (<font color='red'><b>The youth</b></font>)</div>The youth assumed a discreet indignation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thy feyther's had dozens o' such letters, lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the miser said with
cold emphasis, `or my name's not Tellwright. Dunna tell me as Titus
Price's never heard of a bumbailiff afore.''

<p/>Willie was crushed at a blow, and obliged to retreat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) smiled
painfully. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Tellwright. Don't talk like that. All we want
is time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Time is money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, `and if us give you time us give you
money. <div class="bookquote">``Stead o' that, it's you as mun give us money. That's right
reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Willie laughed with difficulty. <div class="bookquote">``See here, Mr. Tellwright. To cut a
long story short, it's like this. You ask for twenty-five pounds.
I've got in my pocket a bill of exchange drawn by us on Mr. Sutton and
endorsed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), for thirty pounds, payable in three months. Will you
take that? Remember it's for thirty, and you only ask for twenty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Mr. Sutton has dealings with ye, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>Willie answered proudly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) buys off us regularly. We've
done business for years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pays i' bills at three months, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>The miser</b></font>)</div>The miser grinned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>said Willie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>said the miser.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What--the bill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! The bill's all right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>Willie took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) pocket, and
opening out the blue paper, gave it to old Tellwright. Anna perceived
the anxiety on the youth's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) flushed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hand trembled.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared not speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to be at ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
knew from infallible signs that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father would take the bill.
Ephraim gazed at the stamped paper as at something strange and
unprecedented in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father would want you not to negotiate that bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>said Willie. <div class="bookquote">``The
fact is, we promised Mr. Sutton that that particular bill should not
leave our hands--unless it was absolutely necessary. So father would
like you not to discount it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will redeem it before it matures.
You quite understand--we don't care to offend an old customer like Mr.
Sutton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then this bit o' paper's worth nowt for welly-LSB-1-RSB- three months?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the
old man said, with an affectation of bewildered simplicity.

<p/>Happily inspired for once, Willie made no answer, but put the question:
<div class="bookquote">``Will you take it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! Us'll tak' it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, `though it is but a promise.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) was well pleased.

<p/>Young Price's face showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) relief. It was now evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had
been passing through an ordeal. Anna guessed that perhaps everything
had depended on the acceptance by Tellwright of that bill. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
refused it, Prices, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, might have come to sudden disaster.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt glad and disburdened for the moment; but immediately it
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father would not rest satisfied for long; a
few weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would give another turn to the screw.


<p/>The Tellwrights were destined to have other visitors that afternoon.
Agnes, coming from school, was accompanied by a lady. Anna, who was
setting the tea-table, saw a double shadow pass the window, and heard
voices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran into the kitchen, and found Mrs. Sutton seated on a
chair, breathing quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll excuse me coming in so unceremoniously, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said, after
having kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) heartily. <div class="bookquote">``But Agnes said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) always came in by
the back way, so I came that way too. Now I'm resting a minute. I've
had to walk to-day. Our horse has gone lame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This kind heart radiated a heavenly goodwill, even in the most ordinary
phrases. Anna began to expand at once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now do come into the parlour,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, `and let me make you
comfortable.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a minute, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton begged, fanning herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
handkerchief, <div class="bookquote">``Agnes's legs are so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Sutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes protested, laughing, `how can you? I could
scarcely keep up with you!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I never could walk slowly. I'm one of them that go
till they drop. It's very silly.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) smiled, and the two girls
smiled happily in return.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housewife</b></font>)</div>said the housewife, `set another cup and saucer and plate.''
Agnes threw down her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hat and satchel of books, eager to show
hospitality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It still keeps very warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna remarked, as Mrs. Sutton was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's beautifully cool here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton. <div class="bookquote">``I see you've got your
kitchen like a new pin, Anna, if you'll excuse me saying so. Henry was
very enthusiastic about this kitchen the other night, at our house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Mr. Mynors?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna reddened to the eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s a very particular young man, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>The kettle conveniently boiled at that moment, and Anna went to the
range to make the tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea is all ready, Mrs. Sutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said at length. <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you
could do with a cup.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I could,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton. <div class="bookquote">``It's what I've come for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have tea at four. Father will be glad to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>The clock
struck, and they went into the parlour, Anna carrying the tea-pot and
the hot-water jug. Agnes had preceded them. The old man was sitting
expectant in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>said the visitor, `you see I've called to see
you, and to beg a cup of tea. I overtook Agnes coming home from
school--overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), mind--me, at my age!'' Ephraim rose slowly and
shook hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're welcome,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) said curtly, but with a kindliness that amazed
Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was unaware that in past days he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) had known Mrs. Sutton as a
young and charming girl, a vision that had stirred poetic ideas in
hundreds of prosaic breasts, Tellwright's included. There was scarcely
a middle-aged male Wesleyan in Bursley and Hanbridge who had not a
peculiar regard for Mrs. Sutton, and who did not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) alone
truly appreciated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an' you bin tiring yourself with this afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) asked, when
they had begun tea, and Mrs. Sutton had refused a second piece of
bread-and-butter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I been doing? I've been seeing to some inside repairs to
the superintendent's house. Be thankful you aren't a circuit-steward's
wife, Anna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, does she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) have to see to the repairs of the minister's house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked, surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should just think she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has to stand between the minister's
wife and the funds of the society. And Mrs. Reginald Banks has been
used to the very best of everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>)'s just a bit exacting, though
I must say she (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>)'s willing enough to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) own money too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) wants
a new boiler in the scullery now, and I'm sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) boiler is a great
deal better than ours. But we must try to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) isn't used
to us rough folks and our ways. Mr. Banks said to me this afternoon
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) tried always to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Banks</b></font>) from the worries of this world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled almost imperceptibly.

<p/>There was a ring at the bell, and Agnes, much perturbed by the august
arrival, let in Mr. Banks himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I enter, my little dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banks</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Banks. <div class="bookquote">``Your father, your
sister, in?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It ne'er rains but it pours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, who had caught the
minister's voice.

<p/>``Speak of angels--' said Mrs. Sutton, laughing quietly.

<p/>The minister came grandly into the parlour. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! How do you do,
brother Tellwright, and you, Miss Tellwright? Mrs. Sutton, we two seem
happily fated to meet this afternoon. Don't let me disturb you, I
beg--I cannot stay. My time is very limited. I wish I could call
oftener, brother Tellwright; but really the new _régime_ leaves no time
for pastoral visits. I was saying to my wife only this morning that I
haven't had a free afternoon for a month.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) accepted a cup of tea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Us'n have a tea-party this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright
_quasi_-privately to Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>the minister resumed, <div class="bookquote">``I've come to beg. The special fund,
you know, Mr. Tellwright, to clear off the debt on the new
school-buildings. I referred to it from the pulpit last Sabbath. It's
not in my province to go round begging, but someone must do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, for me, I'm beforehand with you, Mr. Banks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton,
`for it's on that very errand I've called to see Mr. Tellwright this
afternoon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) name is on my list.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Then I leave our brother to your superior persuasions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, `you're between two fires,
and you'll get no mercy. What will you give?''

<p/>The miser foresaw a probable discomfiture, and sought for some means of
escape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are others giving?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My husband is giving fifty pounds, and you could buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) up, lock,
stock, and barrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, aghast at this sum. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had underrated the
importance of the Building Fund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``I have but fifty pounds in the
world, but I am giving twenty to this fund.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you're giving too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright with quick brusqueness.
<div class="bookquote">``You canna' afford it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lord will provide,''  (<font color='red'><b>the parson</b></font>)</div>said the parson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will, happen not. It's as well you've gotten a rich wife,
Mr. Banks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The parson</b></font>)</div><p/>The parson's dignity was obviously wounded, and Anna wondered timidly
what would occur next. Mrs. Sutton interposed. <div class="bookquote">``Come now, Mr.
Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said again, `to the point: what will you give?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think it over and let you hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Ephraim.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! That won't do at all, will it, Mr. Banks? I, at any rate, am
not going away without a definite promise. As an old and good
Wesleyan, of course you will feel it your duty to be generous with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You used to be a pillar of the Hanbridge circuit--was it not so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Banks</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Banks to the miser, recovering himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So they used to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tellwright replied grimly. ``That was because I
cleared 'em of debt in ten years. But they've slipped into th' ditch
again sin' I left <div class="bookquote">``em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I am right, you do not meet-LSB-2-RSB- with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>the minister pursued
imperturbably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own class is at three on Saturdays,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the minister. <div class="bookquote">``I should
be glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you what I'll do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>said the miser to Mrs. Sutton. <div class="bookquote">``Titus Price
is a big man at th' Sunday-school. I'll give as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) gives to
th' school buildings. That's fair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what Mr. Price is giving?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton asked the minister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw Mr. Price yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is giving twenty-five pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, that's a bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, who had succeeded
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) expectations.

<p/>Ephraim was the dupe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) own scheming. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) had made sure that
Price's contribution would be a small one. This ostentatious
munificence on the part of the beggared Titus filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) with secret
anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) determined to demand more rent at a very early date.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll put you down for twenty-five pounds as a first subscription,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the minister, taking out a pocket-book. Perhaps you will give
Mrs. Sutton or myself the cheque to-day?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mr. Price paid?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the miser asked, warily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then come to me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) has.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Ephraim perceived the way of escape.

<p/>When the minister was gone, as Mrs. Sutton seemed in no hurry to
depart, Anna and Agnes cleared the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've just been telling your father, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, when Anna
returned to the room, `that Mr. Sutton and myself and Beatrice are
going to the Isle of Man soon for a fortnight or so, and we should very
much like you to come with us.''

<p/>Anna's heart began to beat violently, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew there was no hope
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). This, then, doubtless, was the main object of Mrs. Sutton's
visit! <div class="bookquote">``Oh! But I couldn't, really!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, scarcely aware what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The house? Agnes could see to what little housekeeping your father
would want. The schools will break up next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do these young folks want holidays for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Tellwright inquired with
philosophic gruffness. <div class="bookquote">``I never had one. And what's more, I wouldn't
thank ye for one. I'll pig on at Bursley. When ye've gotten a roof of
your own, where's the sense o' going elsewhere and pigging?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we really want Anna to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton went on. <div class="bookquote">``Beatrice is
very anxious about it. Beatrice is very short of suitable friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should na' ha' thought it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) seems to know
everyone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton insisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think as you'd better leave Anna out this year,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>said the miser
stubbornly.

<p/>Anna wished profoundly that Mrs. Sutton would abandon the futile
attempt. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) perceived that the visitor was signalling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) to
leave the room. Anna obeyed, going into the kitchen to give an eye to
Agnes, who was washing up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton contentedly, when Anna returned to
the parlour. <div class="bookquote">``Your father has consented to your going with us. It is
very kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll miss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna sat down, limp, speechless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not believe the news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are awfully good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to Mrs. Sutton in the lobby, as the
latter was leaving the house. <div class="bookquote">``I'm ever so grateful--you can't think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) arms round Mrs. Sutton's neck.

<p/>Agnes ran up to say good-bye.

<p/>Mrs. Sutton kissed the child. <div class="bookquote">``Agnes will be the little housekeeper,
eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>The housekeeper</b></font>)</div>The little housekeeper was almost as pleased at the prospect of
housekeeping as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) too had been going to the Isle of Man. <div class="bookquote">``You'll
both be at the school-treat next Tuesday, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton said,
holding Agnes by the hand. Agnes glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sister in inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied. <div class="bookquote">``We shall see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The truth was, that not caring to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father for the money for the
tickets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had given no thought to the school-treat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I tell you that Henry Mynors will most likely come with us to the
Isle of Man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton from the gate.

<p/>Anna retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bedroom to savour an astounding happiness in
quietude. At supper the miser was in a mood not unbenevolent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
expected a reaction the next morning, but Ephraim, strange to say,
remained innocuous. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ventured to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) for the money for the
treat tickets, two shillings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) made no immediate reply. Half an
hour afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) ejaculated: <div class="bookquote">``What i' th' name o' fortune dost thee
want wi' school-treats?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered; `of course Agnes can't go alone.''

<p/>In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) threw down a florin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) became perilous for the rest of
the day, but the florin was an indisputable fact in Anna's pocket.

<p/>The school-treat was held in a twelve-acre field near Sneyd, the seat
of a marquis, and a Saturday afternoon resort very popular in the Five
Towns. The children were formed at noon on Duck Bank into a
procession, which marched to the railway station to the singing of
<div class="bookquote">``Shall we gather at the river?''  (<font color='red'><b>Duck</b></font>)</div>Thence a special train carried them,
in seething compartments, excited and strident, to Sneyd, where there
had been two sharp showers in the morning, the procession was reformed
along a country road, and the vacillating sky threatened more rain; but
because the sun had shone dazzlingly at eleven o'clock all the women
and girls, too easily tempted by the glory of the moment, blossomed
forth in pale blouses and parasols. The chattering crowd, bright and
defenceless as flowers, made at Sneyd a picture at once gay and
pathetic. It had rained there at half-past twelve; the roads were wet;
and among the two hundred and fifty children and thirty teachers there
were less than a score umbrellas. The excursion was theoretically in
charge of Titus Price, the Senior Superintendent, but this dignitary
had failed to arrive on Duck Bank, and Mynors had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) place. In
the train Anna heard that some one had seen Mr. Price, wearing a large
grey wideawake, leap into the guard's van at the very instant of
departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had not been at school on the previous Sunday, and Anna
was somewhat perturbed at the prospect of meeting the man who had
defined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as unique in the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business
career. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) caught a glimpse of the grey wideawake on the platform at
Sneyd, and steered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own scholars so as to avoid its vicinity. But
on the march to the field Titus reviewed the procession, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
obliged to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) eyes and return his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) salutation. The look of the
man was a shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) seemed thinner, nervous, restless,
preoccupied, and terribly careworn; except the new brilliant hat, all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) summer clothes were soiled and shabby. It was as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) had
forced himself, out of regard for appearances, to attend the fête, but
had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) thoughts in Edward Street. His (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) uneasy and hollow
cheerfulness was painful to watch. Anna realised the intensity of the
crisis through which Mr. Price was passing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived in a single
glance, more clearly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could have done after a hundred
interviews with the young and unresponsible William--however
distressing these might be--that Titus must for weeks have been engaged
in a truly frightful struggle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) face was a proof of the tragic
sincerity of William's appeals to herself and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father. That
Price should have contrived to pay seventy pounds of rent in a little
more than a month seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), imperfectly acquainted alike with
Ephraim's ruthless compulsions and with the financial jugglery often
practised by hard-pressed debtors, to be an almost miraculous effort
after honesty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) conscience smote her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) for conniving at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) now
saw to be a persecution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt as sorry for Titus as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) son. The obese man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reputation in rags about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was
acutely wistful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, as a child might have been.

<p/>A carriage rolled by, raising the dust in places where the strong sun
had already dried the road. It was Mr. Sutton's landau, driven by
Barrett. Beatrice, in white, sat solitary amid cushions, while two
large hampers occupied most of the coachman's box. The carriage seemed
to move with lordly ease and rapidity, and the teachers, already weary
and fretted by the endless pranks of the children, bitterly envied the
enthroned maid who nodded and smiled to them with such charming
condescension. It was a social triumph for Beatrice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) disappeared
ahead like a goddess in a cloud, and scarcely a woman who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from
the humble level of the roadway but would have married a satyr to be
able to do as Beatrice did. Later, when the field was reached, and the
children bursting through the gate had spread like a flood over the
daisied grass, the landau was to be seen drawn up near the refreshment
tent; Barrett was unpacking the hampers, which contained delicate
creamy confectionery for the teachers' tea; Beatrice explained that
these were her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother's gift, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had driven down in order to
preserve the fragile pasties from the risks of a railway journey.
Gratitude became vocal, and Beatrice's success was perfected.

<p/>Then the more conscientious teachers set themselves seriously to the
task of amusing the smaller children, and the smaller children
consented to be amused according to the recipes appointed by long
custom for school-treats. Many round-games, which invariably comprised
singing or kissing, being thus annually resuscitated by elderly people
from the deeps of memory, were preserved for a posterity which
otherwise would never have known them. Among these was Bobby-Bingo.
For twenty-five years Titus Price had played at Bobby-Bingo with the
infant classes at the school-treat, and this year he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) was bound by the
expectations of all to continue the practice. Another diversion which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) always took care to organise was the three-legged race for boys.
Also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) usually joined in the tut-ball, a quaint game which owes its
surprising longevity to the fact that it is equally proper for both
sexes. Within half an hour the treat was in full career; football,
cricket, rounders, tick, leap-frog, prison-bars, and round-games,
transformed the field into a vast arena of complicated struggles and
emulations. All were occupied, except a few of the women and older
girls, who strolled languidly about in the _rôle_ of spectators. The
sun shone generously on scores of vivid and frail toilettes, and
parasols made slowly-moving hemispheres of glowing colour against the
rich green of the grass. All around were yellow cornfields, and
meadows where cows of a burnished brown indolently meditated upon the
phenomena of a school-treat. Every hedge and ditch and gate and stile
was in that ideal condition of plenary correctness which denotes that a
great landowner is exhibiting the beauties of scientific farming for
the behoof of his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) villagers. The sky, of an intense blue, was a sea in
which large white clouds sailed gently but capriciously; on the
northern horizon a low range of smoke marked the sinister region of the
Five Towns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come and help with the bags and cups?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry Mynors asked
Anna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was standing by herself, watching Agnes at play with some
other girls. Mynors had evidently walked across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) from the
refreshment tent, which was at the opposite extremity of the field. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was once more the exemplar of style. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) suit of grey
flannel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) white straw hat, became him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to admiration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) stood at
ease with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) coat-pockets, and smiled contentedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, `the tea is the principal thing, and, although it
wants two hours to tea-time yet, it's as well to be beforehand.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like something to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said familiarly, after this abrupt opening, and then
shook hands. They traversed the field together, with many deviations
to avoid trespassing upon areas of play.

<p/>The flapping refreshment tent seemed to be full of piles of baskets and
piles of bags and piles of cups, which the contractor had brought in a
waggon. Some teachers were already beginning to put the paper bags
into the baskets; each bag contained bread-and-butter, currant cake, an
Eccles-cake, and a Bath-bun. At the far end of the tent Beatrice
Sutton was arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) dainties on a small trestle-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come along quick, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) exclaimed, `and taste my tarts, and tell
me what you think of them. I do hope the good people will enjoy them.''
And then, turning to Mynors, <div class="bookquote">``Hello! Are you seeing after the bags and
things? I thought that was always Willie Price's favourite job!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``But, unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) isn't here to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How's that, pray? I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) miss a school-treat before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Price told me they couldn't both be away from the works just now.
Very busy, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, William would have been more use than his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father, anyhow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors murmured with a subdued laugh.

<p/>Beatrice was in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) `downright' moods, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) herself called
them.

<p/>Mynors's arrangements for the prompt distribution of tea at the
appointed hour were very minute, and involved a considerable amount of
back bending and manual labour. But, though they were enlivened by
frequent intervals of gossip, and by excursions into the field to
observe this and that amusing sight, all was finished half an hour
before time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go and warn Mr. Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) is quite capable of
forgetting the clock.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors left the tent, and proceeded to the
scene of an athletic meeting, at which Titus Price, in shirt-sleeves,
was distributing prizes of sixpences and pennies. The famous
three-legged race had just been run. Anna followed at a saunter, and
shortly afterwards Beatrice overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great Titus looks better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) did when he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) came on the field,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice remarked. And indeed the superintendent had put on quite a
merry appearance--flushed, excited, and jocular in his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) elephantine
way--it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had not a care in the world. The boys crowded
appreciatively round him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>). But this was his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) last hour of joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! Willie Price _is_ here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna exclaimed, perceiving William in
the fringe of the crowd. The lanky fellow stood hesitatingly, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) left
hand busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) moustache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder what that means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Titus</b></font>)</div><p/>Titus had not observed the newcomer, but Henry Mynors saw William, and
exchanged a few words with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). Then Mr. Mynors advanced into the
crowd and spoke to Mr. Price, who glanced quickly round at his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son.
The girls, at a distance of forty yards, could discern the swift change
in the man's demeanour. In a second he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reverted to the deplorable
Titus of three hours ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) way roughly to William,
getting into his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went. The pair talked, William glanced at
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) watch, and in another moment they were leaving the field. Henry
Mynors had to finish the prize distribution. So much Anna and Beatrice
plainly saw. Others, too, had not been blind to this sudden and
dramatic departure. It aroused universal comment among the teachers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something must be wrong at Price's works,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said, `and Willie
has had to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) papa.'' This was the conclusion of all the
gossips. Beatrice added: <div class="bookquote">``Dad has mentioned Price's several times
lately, now I think of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna grew extremely self-conscious and uncomfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) felt as
though all were saying of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``There goes the oppressor of the poor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was fairly sure, however, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) father was not responsible for
this particular incident. There must, then, be other implacable
creditors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had been thoroughly enjoying the afternoon, but now her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
pleasure ceased.

<p/>The treat ended disastrously. In the middle of the children's meal,
while yet the enormous double-handled tea-cans were being carried up
and down the thirsty rows, and the boys were causing their bags to
explode with appalling detonations, it began to rain sharply. The
fickle sun withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) splendour from the toilettes, and was seen no
more for a week afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``It's come at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Mynors,
who had watched the sky with anxiety for an hour previously. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
mobilised the children and ranked them under a row of elms. The
teachers, running to the tent for their own tea, said to one another
that the shower could only be a brief one. The wish was father to the
thought, for they were a little ashamed to be under cover while their
charges precariously sheltered beneath dripping trees--yet there was
nothing else to be done; the men took turns in the rain to keep the
children in their places. The sky was completely overcast. <div class="bookquote">``It's set
in for a wet evening, and so we may as well make the best of it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said grimly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) sent the landau home empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was
right. A forlorn and disgusted snake of a procession crawled through
puddles to the station. The platform resounded with sneezes. None but
a dressmaker could have discovered a silver lining to the black and
all-pervading cloud which had ruined so many dozens of fair costumes.
Anna, melancholy and taciturn, exerted herself to minimise the
discomfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) scholars. A word from Mynors would have been balm to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); but Mynors, the general of a routed army, was parleying by
telephone with the traffic-manager of the railway for the expediting of
the special train.

<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>THE ISLE

<p/>About this time Anna was not seeing very much of Henry Mynors. At
twenty a man is rash in love, and again, perhaps, at fifty; a man of
middle-age enamoured of a young girl is capable of sublime follies.
But the man of thirty who loves for the first time is usually the
embodiment of cautious discretion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not fall in love with a
violent descent, but rather lets himself gently down, continually
testing the rope. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) social value, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have achieved
worldly success, is at its highest, and, without conceit, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is aware
of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has lost many illusions concerning women; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen more
than one friend wrecked in the sea of foolish marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows the
joys of a bachelor's freedom, without having wearied of them; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
perceives risks where the youth perceives only ecstasy, and the oldster
only a blissful release from solitude. Instead of searching, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
sought for; accordingly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is selfish and exacting. All these things,
combine to tranquillize passion at thirty. Mynors was in love with
Anna, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) love had its ardent moments; but in the main it was a
temperate affection, an affection that walked circumspectly, with its
eyes open, careful of its dignity, too proud to seem in a hurry; if, by
impulse, it chanced now and then to leap forward, the involuntary
movement was mastered and checked. Mynors called at Manor Terrace once
a week, never on the same day of the week, nor without discussing
business with the miser. Occasionally he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) accompanied Anna from school
or chapel. Such methods were precisely to Anna's taste. Like him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
loved prudence and decorum, preferring to make haste slowly. Since the
Revival, they had only once talked together intimately; on that sole
occasion Henry had suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might care to join Mrs.
Sutton's class, which met on Monday nights; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) accepted the hint with
pleasure, and found a well of spiritual inspiration in Mrs. Sutton's
modest and simple yet fervent homilies. Mynors was not guilty of
blowing both hot and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) was sure of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) waited calmly for
events, existing, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) habit was, in the future.

<p/>The future, then, meant the Isle of Man. Anna dreamed of an enchanted
isle and hours of unimaginable rapture. For a whole week after Mrs.
Sutton had won Ephraim's consent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) vision never stooped to practical
details. Then Beatrice called to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>); it was the morning after the
treat, and Anna was brushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) muddy frock; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wore a large white
apron, and held a cloth-brush in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're busy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, `but come in. Come into the kitchen--do you mind?''

<p/>Beatrice was covered from neck to heel with a long mackintosh, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) threw off when entering the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anyone else in the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, smiling, as Beatrice seated herself, with a sigh of
content, on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's talk, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) pocket the
indispensable chocolates and offered them to Anna. <div class="bookquote">``I say, wasn't last
night perfectly awful? Henry got wet through in the end, and mother
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stop at our house, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was at the trouble to take me home.
Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) go down this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, stiffly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--no reason. Only I thought perhaps you did. I simply can't tell
you how glad I am that you're coming with us to the Isle of Man; we
shall have rare fun. We go every year, you know--to Port Erin, a
lovely little fishing village. All the fishermen know us there. Last
year Henry hired a yacht for the fortnight, and we all went
mackerel-fishing, every day; except sometimes Pa.. Now and then Pa had
a tendency to go fiddling in caves and things. I do hope it will be
fine weather again by then, don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm looking forward to it, I can tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said. <div class="bookquote">``What day are
we supposed to start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Saturday week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna was surprised at the proximity of the event.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and quite late enough, too. We should start earlier, only the
Dad always makes out he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) can't. Men always pretend to be so frightfully
busy, and I believe it's all put on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice continued to chat about
the holiday, and then of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``What are you going to
wear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna repeated; and added, with hesitation: <div class="bookquote">``I suppose one will
want some new clothes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, just a few! Now let me advise you. Take a blue serge skirt.
Sea-water won't harm it, and if it's dark enough it will look well to
any mortal blouse. Secondly, you can't have too many blouses; they're
always useful at the seaside. Plain straw-hats are my tip. A coat for
nights, and thick boots. There! Of course no one ever _dresses_ at
Port Erin. It isn't like Llandudno, and all that sort of thing. You
don't have to meet your young man on the pier, because there isn't a
pier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause. Anna did not know what to say. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
ventured: <div class="bookquote">``I'm not much for clothes, as I dare say you've noticed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you always look nice, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice responded. Nothing
was said as to Anna's wealth, no reference made as to the discrepancy
between that and the style of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) garments. By a fiction, there was
supposed to be no discrepancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you make your own frocks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice asked, later.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know I thought you did. But they do you great credit. There's
few people can make a plain frock look decent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>This conversation brought Anna with a shock to the level of earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
perceived--only too well--a point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not hitherto fairly
faced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) idyllic meditations: that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father was still a factor in
the case. Since Mrs. Sutton's visit both Anna and the miser avoided
the subject of the holiday. <div class="bookquote">``You can't have too many blouses.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Did
Beatrice, then, have blouses by the dozen? A coat, a serge skirt,
straw hats -LRB-how many?-RRB---the catalogue frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) began to
suspect that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would not be able to go to the Isle of Man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About me going with Suttons to the Isle of Man?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
father, in the afternoon, outwardly calm, but with secret trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall want some money--a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) would have given much not to
have added that <div class="bookquote">``little,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>but it came out of itself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a waste o' time and money--that's what I call it. I can't think
why Suttons asked ye. Ye aren't ill, are ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) savagery changed to
sullenness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father; but as it's arranged, I suppose I shall have to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm none so set up with the idea mysen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shan't you be all right with Agnes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes. _I_ shall be all right. _I_ don't want much. _I_'ve no
fads and fal-lals. How long art going to be away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Didn't Mrs. Sutton tell you? You arranged it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I didna'. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said nowt to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, anyhow I shall want some clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for? Art naked?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have some money.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) voice shook. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was getting near tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, thou's gotten thy own money, hast na'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All I want is that you shall let me have some of my own money.
There's forty odd pounds now in the bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repeated, sneering, `all ye want is as I shall let thee have
some o' thy own money. And there's forty odd pound i' the bank. Oh!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give me my cheque-book out of the bureau? And I'll draw a
cheque; I know how to.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had conquered the instinct to cry, and
unwillingly her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) tones became somewhat peremptory. Ephraim seized the
chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I won't give ye the cheque-book out o' th' bureau,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) said
flatly. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll thank ye for less sauce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That finished the episode. Proudly she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) took an oath with herself not
to re-open the question, and resolved to write a note to Mrs. Sutton
saying that on consideration she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) found it impossible to go to the Isle
of Man.

<p/>The next morning there came to Anna a letter from the secretary of a
limited company enclosing a post-office order for ten pounds. Some
weeks previously her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father had discovered an error of that amount in
the deduction of income-tax from the dividend paid by this company, and
had instructed Anna to demand the sum. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had obeyed, and then
forgotten the affair. Here was the answer. Desperate at the thought
of missing the holiday, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cashed the order, bought and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
clothes in secret, and then, two days before the arranged date of
departure told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was enraged; but since
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anger was too illogical to be rendered effectively coherent in
words, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had the wit to keep silence. With bitterness Anna reflected
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) holiday to the merest accident--for if the remittance
had arrived a little earlier or a little later, or in the form of a
cheque, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not have utilised it.


<p/>It was an incredible day, the following Saturday, a warm and benign day
of earliest autumn. The Suttons, in a hired cab, called for Anna at
half-past eight, on the way to the main line station at Shawport.
Anna's tin box was flung on to the roof of the cab amid the trunks and
portmanteaux already there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should not Agnes ride with us to the station?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay; there's no room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tellwright/Mr. Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Tellwright, who stood at the door,
impelled by an unacknowledged awe of Mrs. Sutton thus to give official
sanction to Anna's departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Let the little thing come, Mr.
Tellwright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>Agnes, far more excited than any of the rest, seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) straw hat, and
slipping the elastic under her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) small chin, sprang into the cab, and
found a haven between Mr. Sutton's short, fat legs. The driver drew
his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip smartly across the aged neck of the cream mare. They were
off. What a rumbling, jolting, delicious journey, down the first hill,
up Duck Bank, through the market-place, and down the steep declivity of
Oldcastle Street! Silent and shy, Agnes smiled ecstatically at the
others. Anna answered remarks in a dream. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was conscious only of
present happiness and happy expectation. All bitterness had
disappeared. At least thirty thousand Bursley folk were not going to
the Isle of Man that day--their preoccupied and cheerless faces swam in
a continuous stream past the cab window--and Anna sympathised with
every unit of them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spirit overflowed with universal compassion.
What haste and exquisite confusion at the station! The train was
signalled, and the porter, crossing the line with the luggage, ran his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
truck perilously under the very buffers of the incoming engine. Mynors
was awaiting them, admirably attired as a tourist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had got the
tickets, and secured a private compartment in the through-coach for
Liverpool; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) found time to arrange with the cabman to drive Agnes
home on the box-seat. Certainly there was none like Mynors. From the
footboard of the carriage Anna bent down to kiss Agnes. The child had
been laughing and chattering. Suddenly, as Anna's lips touched hers,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) burst into tears, sobbed passionately as though overtaken by some
terrible and unexpected misfortune. Tears stood also in Anna's eyes.
The sisters had never been parted before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor little thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton murmured; and Beatrice told her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) father
to give Agnes a shilling to buy chocolates at Stevenson's in St. Luke's
Square, that being the best shop. The shilling fell between the
footboard and the platform. A scream from Beatrice! The attendant
porter promised to rescue the shilling in due course. The engine
whistled, the silver-mounted guard asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) authority, Mynors
leaped in, and amid laughter and tears the brief and unique joy of
Anna's life began.

<p/>In a moment, so it seemed, the train was thundering through the mile of
solid rock which ends at Lime Street Station, Liverpool.
Thenceforward, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fell asleep that night, Anna existed in a state
of blissful bewilderment, stupefied by an overdose of novel and
wondrous sensations. They lunched in amazing magnificence at the
Bear's Paw, and then walked through the crowded and prodigious streets
to Prince's landing-stage. The luggage had disappeared by some
mysterious agency--Mynors said that they would find it safe at Douglas;
but Anna could not banish the fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tin box had gone for ever.

<p/>The great, wavy river, churned by thousands of keels; the monstrous
steamer--the ``Mona's Isle'--whose side rose like solid wall out of the
water; the vistas of its decks; its vast saloons, story under story,
solid and palatial -LRB-could all this float?-RRB-; its high bridge; its
hawsers as thick as trees; its funnels like sloping towers; the
multitudes of passengers; the whistles, hoots, cries; the
far-stretching panorama of wharves and docks; the squat ferry-craft
carrying horses and carts, and no one looking twice at the feat--it was
all too much, too astonishing, too lovely. She (<font color='blue'><b>multitudes</b></font>) had not guessed at this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They call Liverpool the slum of Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed, shocked.

<p/>Beatrice, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) radiant and rapt face, walked to and fro with
Anna, proud of the effect produced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friend's inexperience by
these sights. One might have thought that Beatrice had built Liverpool
and created its trade by her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) own efforts.

<p/>Suddenly the landing-stage and all the people on it moved away bodily
from the ship; there was green water between; a tremor like that of an
earthquake ran along the deck; handkerchiefs were waved. The voyage
had commenced. Mynors found chairs for all the Suttons, and tucked
them up on the lee-side of a deck-house; but Anna did not stir. They
passed New Brighton, Seaforth, and the Crosby and Formby lightships.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and view the ship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we go
round and inspect things a bit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a very big one, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty big,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said; `of course not as big as the Atlantic liners--I
wonder we didn't meet one in the river--but still pretty big. Three
hundred and twenty feet over all. I sailed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) last year on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
maiden voyage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was packed, and the weather very bad.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will it be rough to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna inquired timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it keeps like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``You don't feel queer, do
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no. It's as firm as a house. No one could be ill with this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Beatrice could be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They descended into the ship, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) explained all its internal
economy, with a knowledge that seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) encyclopædic. They stayed
a long time watching the engines, so Titanic, ruthless, and deliberate;
even the smell of the oil was pleasant to Anna. When they came on deck
again the ship was at sea. For the first time Anna beheld the ocean.
A strong breeze blew from prow to stern, yet the sea was absolutely
calm, the unruffled mirror of effulgent sunlight. The steamer moved
alone on the waters, exultantly, leaving behind it an endless track of
white froth in the green, and the shadow of its smoke. The sun, the
salt breeze, the living water, the proud gaiety of the ship, produced a
feeling of intense, inexplicable joy, a profound satisfaction with the
present, and a negligence of past and future. To exist was enough,
then. As Anna and Henry leaned over the starboard quarter and watched
the torrent of foam rush madly and ceaselessly from under the
paddle-box to be swallowed up in the white wake, the spectacle of the
wild torrent almost hypnotised them, destroying thought and reason, and
all sense of their relation to other things. With difficulty Anna
raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, and perceived the dim receding line of the Lancashire
coast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we get quite out of sight of land?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for a little while, about half an hour or so. Just as much out
of sight of land as if we were in the middle of the Atlantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can scarcely believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! The idea of that--of being out of sight of land--nothing but sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Suttons</b></font>)</div><p/>When at last it occurred to them to reconnoitre the Suttons, they found
all three still in their deck-chairs, enwrapped and languid. Mr.
Sutton and Beatrice were apparently dozing. This part of the deck was
occupied by somnolent, basking figures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't wake them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton enjoined, whispering out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) hood.
Anna glanced curiously at Beatrice's yellow face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice exclaimed, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) eyes and shutting them
again, wearily.

<p/>So they went away, and discovered two empty deck-chairs on the
fore-deck. Anna was innocently vain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) immunity from _malaise_.
Mynors appeared to appoint himself little errands about the deck,
returning frequently to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Look over there. Can you see
anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna ran to the rail, with the infantile idea of getting nearer, and
Mynors followed, laughing. What looked like a small slate-coloured
cloud lay on the horizon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I seem to see something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the Isle of Man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>By insensible gradations the contours of the land grew clearer in the
afternoon haze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How far are we off now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps twenty miles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Twenty miles of uninterrupted flatness, and the ship steadily invading
that separating solitude, yard by yard, furlong by furlong! The
conception awed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). There, a morsel in the waste of the deep, a speck
under the infinite sunlight, lay the island, mysterious, enticing,
enchanted, a glinting jewel on, the sea's bosom, a remote entity
fraught with strange secrets. It was all unspeakable.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, you have covered yourself with glory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, when
they were in the diminutive and absurd train which by breathless
plunges annihilates the sixteen miles between Douglas and Port Erin in
sixty-five minutes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By not being ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's always the beginner's luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, pale and
dishevelled. They all relapsed into the silence of fatigue. It was
growing dusk when the train stopped at the tiny terminus. The station
was a hive of bustling activity, the arrival of this train being the
daily event at that end of the world. Mynors and the Suttons were
greeted familiarly by several sailors, and one of these, Tom Kelly, a
tall, middle-aged man, with grey beard, small grey eyes, a wrinkled
skin of red mahogany, and an enormous fist, was introduced to Anna. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>)
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) cap, and shook hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was touched by the sad, kind look
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) face, the melancholy impress of the sea. Then they drove to
their lodging, and here again the party was welcomed as being old and
tried friends. A fire was burning in the parlour. Throwing herself
down in front of it, Mrs. Sutton breathed, <div class="bookquote">``At last! Oh, for some
tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Through the window, Anna had a glimpse of a deeply indented bay
at the foot of cliffs below them, with a bold headland to the right.
Fishing vessels with flat red sails seemed to hang undecided just
outside the bay. From cottage chimneys beneath the road blue smoke
softly ascended.

<p/>All went early to bed, for the weariness of Mr. and Mrs. Sutton seemed
to communicate itself to the three young people, who might otherwise
have gone forth into the village in search of adventures. Anna and
Beatrice shared a room. Each inspected the other's clothes, and
Beatrice made Anna try on the new serge skirt. Through the thin wall
came the sound of Mr. and Mrs. Sutton talking, a high voice, then a
bass reply, in continual alternation. Beatrice said that these two
always discussed the day's doings in such manner. In a few moments
Beatrice was snoring; she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had the subdued but steady and serious snore
characteristic of some muscular men. Anna felt no inclination to
sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lived again hour by hour through the day, and beneath
Beatrice's snore her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) ear caught the undertone of the sea.

<p/>The next morning was as lovely as the last. It was Sunday, and every
activity of the village was stilled. Sea and land were equally folded
in a sunlit calm. During breakfast--a meal abundant in fresh herrings,
fresh eggs and fresh rolls, eaten with the window wide open--Anna was
puzzled by the singular amenity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friends to one another and to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). They were as polite as though they had been strangers; they
chatted amiably, were full of goodwill, and as anxious to give
happiness as to enjoy it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought at first, so unusual was it to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as a feature of domestic privacy, that this demeanour was affected,
or at any rate a somewhat exaggerated punctilio due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) presence;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soon came to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was mistaken. After breakfast Mr.
Sutton suggested that they should attend the Wesleyan Chapel on the
hill leading to the Chasms. Here they met the sailors of the night
before, arrayed now in marvellous blue Melton coats with velveteen
collars. Tom Kelly walked back with them to the beach, and showed them
the yacht ``Fay' which Mynors had arranged to hire for mackerel-fishing;
it lay on the sands speckless in new white paint. All the afternoon
they dozed on the cliffs, doing nothing whatever, for this Sunday was
tacitly regarded, not as part of the holiday, but as a preparation for
the holiday; all felt that the holiday, with its proper exertions and
appointed delights, would really begin on Monday morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go for a walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, after tea, to Beatrice and Anna.
They stood at the gate of the lodging-house. The old people were
resting within.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You two go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice replied, looking at Anna. <div class="bookquote">``You know I hate
walking, Henry. I'll stop with mother and dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Throughout the day Anna had been conscious of the fact that all the
Suttons showed a tendency, slight but perceptible, to treat Henry and
herself as a pair desirous of opportunities for being alone together.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not like it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flushed under the passing glance with which
Beatrice accompanied the words: <div class="bookquote">``You two go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Nevertheless, when
Mynors placidly remarked: <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) eyes sought hers for a
consent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) could not refuse it. One part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) nature would have
preferred to find an excuse for staying at home; but another, and a
stronger, part insisted on seizing this offered joy.

<p/>They walked straight up out of the village toward the high coast-range
which stretches peak after peak from Port Erin to Peel. The stony and
devious lanes wound about the bleak hillside, passing here and there
small, solitary cottages of whitewashed stone, with children, fowls,
and dogs at the doors, all embowered in huge fuchsia trees. Presently
they had surmounted the limit of habitation and were on the naked flank
of Bradda, following a narrow track which crept upwards amid short
mossy turf of the most vivid green. Nothing seemed to flourish on this
exposed height except bracken, sheep, and boulders that, from a
distance, resembled sheep; there was no tree, scarcely a shrub; the
immense contours, stark, grim, and unrelieved, rose in melancholy and
defiant majesty against the sky: the hand of man could coax no harvest
from these smooth but obdurate slopes; they had never relented, and
they would never relent. The spirit was braced by the thought that
here, to the furthest eternity of civilisation more and more intricate,
simple and strong souls would always find solace and repose.

<p/>Mynors bore to the left for a while, striking across the moor in the
direction of the sea. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look down, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The little bay lay like an oblong swimming-bath five hundred feet below
them. The surface of the water was like glass; the strand, with its
phalanx of boats drawn up in Sabbath tidiness, glittered like marble in
the living light, and over this marble black dots moved slowly to and
fro; behind the boats were the houses--dolls' houses--each with a
curling wisp of smoke; further away the railway and the high road ran
out in a black and white line to Port St. Mary; the sea, a pale grey,
encompassed all; the southern sky had a faint sapphire tinge, rising to
delicate azure. The sight of this haven at rest, shut in by the
restful sea and by great moveless hills, a calm within a calm, aroused
profound emotion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, as they stood gazing. Tears came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes
and hung there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered that scenery should cause tears, felt
ashamed, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face so that Mynors should not see. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had
seen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we go on to the top?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) suggested, and they set their faces
northwards to climb still higher. At length they stood on the rocky
summit of Bradda, seven hundred feet from the sea. The Hill of the
Night Watch lifted above them to the north, but on east, south, and
west, the prospect was bounded only by the ocean. The coast-line was
revealed for thirty miles, from Peel to Castletown. Far to the east
was Castletown Bay, large, shallow and inhospitable, its floor strewn
with a thousand unseen wrecks; the lighthouse at Scarlet Point flashed
dimly in the dusk; thence the beach curved nearer in an immense arc,
without a sign of life, to the little cove of Port St. Mary, and jutted
out again into a tongue of land at the end of which lay the Calf of Man
with its single white cottage and cart-track. The dangerous Calf
Sound, where the vexed tide is forced to run nine hours one way and
three the other, seemed like a grey ribbon, and the Chicken Rock like a
tiny pencil on a vast slate. Port Erin was hidden under their feet.
They looked westward. The darkening sky was a labyrinth of purple and
crimson scarves drawn pellucid, as though by the finger of God, across
a sheet of pure saffron. These decadent tints of the sunset faded in
every direction to the same soft azure which filled the south, and one
star twinkled in the illimitable field. Thirty miles off, on the
horizon, could be discerned the Mourne Mountains of Ireland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors exclaimed, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) arm.

<p/>The huge disc of the moon was rising in the east, and as this mild lamp
passed up the sky, the sense of universal quiescence increased.
Lovely, Anna had said. It was the loveliest sight her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes had ever
beheld, a panorama of pure beauty transcending all imagined visions.
It overwhelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), thrilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to the heart, this revelation of the
loveliness of the world. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts went back to Hanbridge and
Bursley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life there; and all the remembered scenes, bathed in
the glow of a new ideal, seemed to lose their pain. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had never been really unhappy, as if there was no real unhappiness on
the whole earth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived that the monotony, the austerity, the
melancholy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) existence had been sweet and beautiful of its kind,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recalled, with a sort of rapture, hours of companionship with
the beloved Agnes, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father was equable and pacific. Nothing
was ugly nor mean. Beauty was everywhere, in everything.

<p/>In silence they began to descend, perforce walking quickly because of
the steep gradient. At the first cottage they saw a little girl in a
mob-cap playing with two kittens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How like Agnes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was just thinking so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) up on the hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) will miss you,
won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) cried herself to sleep last night. You mightn't guess it,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) is extremely sensitive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not guess it? Why not? I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) is. Do you know--I am very
fond of your sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a simply delightful child. And there's a
lot in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), too. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s so quick and bright, and somehow like a little
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s exactly like a woman sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Sometimes I
fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a great deal older than I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Older than any of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) corrected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said, content. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thinks all the world
of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``My word, wouldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be vexed if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew I
had told you that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This appreciation of Agnes brought them into closer intimacy, and they
talked the more easily of other things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will freeze to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors said; and then, suddenly looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) in the twilight: <div class="bookquote">``You are feeling chill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are. Put this muffler round your neck.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) took a muffler
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, really! You will need it yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) drew a little away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), as if to avoid the muffler.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) did so, and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), tying it loosely and untidily round her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
throat. That feeling of the untidiness of the muffler, of its being
something strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) skin, something with the rough virtue of
masculinity, which no one could detect in the gloom, was in itself
pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wager Mrs. Sutton has a good fire burning when we get in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) thought with joyous anticipation of the warm, bright, sitting-room,
the supper, and the vivacious good-natured conversation. Though the
walk was nearly at an end, other delights were in store. Of the
holiday, thirteen complete days yet remained, each to be as happy as
the one now closing. It was an age! At last they entered the human
cosiness of the village. As they walked up the steps of their lodging
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) opened the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) quickly drew off the muffler and
returned it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) with a word of thanks.

<p/>On Monday morning, when Beatrice and Anna came downstairs, they found
the breakfast odorously cooling on the table, and nobody in the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are they all, I wonder. Any letters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's your mother, out on the front--and Mr. Mynors too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>Beatrice threw up the window, and called: <div class="bookquote">``Come along, Henry; come
along, mother. Everything's going cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors cheerfully replied. <div class="bookquote">``Come out here, both of you, and
begin the day properly with a dose of ozone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I loathe cold bacon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, glancing at the table, and they
went out into the road, where Mrs. Sutton kissed them with as much
fervour as if they had arrived from a long journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look pale, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) remarked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel pale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's that long walk last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice put in. <div class="bookquote">``Henry always goes
too far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't--' Anna began; but at that moment Mr. Sutton, lumbering and
ponderous, joined the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said, without greeting anyone, `hast noticed those
half-finished houses down the road yonder by the <div class="bookquote">``Falcon'' (<font color='red'><b>anyone</b></font>)</div>? I've been
having a chat with Kelly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) tells me the fellow that was building
them has gone bankrupt, and they're at a stand-still. The Receiver
wants to sell 'em. In fact Kelly says they're going cheap. I believe
they'd be a good spec.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Father, I wish you would
leave your specs alone when you're on your holiday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) affectionately protested, and continued: <div class="bookquote">``They're
fairly well built, seemingly, and the rafters are on the roof. Anna,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) quickly, as if counting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) sympathy, `you must
come with me and look at 'em after breakfast. Happen they might suit
your father--or you. I know your father's fond of a good spec.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) assented with a ready smile. This was the beginning of a fancy
which the Alderman always afterwards showed for Anna.

<p/>After breakfast Mrs. Sutton, Beatrice, and Anna arranged to go shopping:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father--brass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton ejaculated in two monosyllables to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much will content ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me five or ten pounds to go on with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opened the left-hand front pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trousers--a pocket which
fastened with a button; and leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chair drew out a fat
purse, and passed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife with a preoccupied air. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) helped
herself, and then Beatrice intercepted the purse and lightened it of
half a sovereign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pocket-money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said; <div class="bookquote">``I'm ruined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>The Alderman's eyes requested Anna to observe how he (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) was robbed. At
last the purse was safely buttoned up again.

<p/>Mrs. Sutton's purchases of food at the three principal shops of the
village seemed startlingly profuse to Anna, but gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) became
accustomed to the scale, and to the amazing habit of always buying the
very best of everything, from beefsteak to grapes. Anna calculated
that the housekeeping could not cost less than six pounds a week for
the five. At Manor Terrace three people existed on a pound. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
half-sovereign Beatrice bought a belt and a pair of sand-shoes, and
some cigarettes for Henry. Mrs. Sutton bought a pipe with a nickel
cap, such as is used by sailors. When they returned to the house, Mr.
Sutton and Henry were smoking on the front. All five walked in a row
down to the harbour, the Alderman giving an arm each to Beatrice and
Anna. Near the ``Falcon' the procession had to be stopped in order to
view the unfinished houses. Tom Kelly had a cabin partly excavated out
of the rock behind the little quay. Here they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) entangled amid
nets, sails, and oars. All crowded into the cabin and shook hands with
its owner, who remarked with severity on their pallid faces, and
insisted that a change of complexion must be brought about. Mynors
offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) tobacco-pouch, but on seeing the light colour of the
tobacco he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) head and refused it, at the same time taking from
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) jersey a lump of something that resembled leather.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) this, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton whispered, handing Mynors the pipe
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had bought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Sutton wishes you to accept this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, thank ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``There's a leddy that knows my taste.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) cut some shreds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) plug with a clasp-knife and charged and
lighted the pipe, filling the cabin with asphyxiating fumes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you can smoke such horrid, nasty stuff,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said
Beatrice, coughing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) laughed condescendingly at Beatrice's petulant manner. <div class="bookquote">``That stuff
of Henry's is boy's tobacco,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said shortly.

<p/>It was decided that they should go fishing in the <div class="bookquote">``Fay.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a
light southerly breeze, a cloudy sky, and smooth water. Under charge
of young Tom Kelly, a sheepish lad of sixteen, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) father's smile,
they all got into an inconceivably small dinghy, loading it down till
it was almost awash. Old Tom himself helped Anna to embark, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
where to tread, and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gently into a seat at the stern. No one
else seemed to be disturbed, but Anna was in a state of desperate fear.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never committed herself to a boat before, and the little waves
spat up against the sides in a most alarming way as young Tom jerked
the dinghy along with the short sculls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went white, and clung in
silence fiercely to the gunwale. In a few moments they were tied up to
the <div class="bookquote">``Fay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which seemed very big and safe in comparison with the
dinghy. They clambered on board, and in the deep well of the two-ton
yacht Anna contrived to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was reassured by the
painted legend in the well, <div class="bookquote">``Licensed to carry eleven.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Young Tom and
Henry busied themselves with ropes, and suddenly a huge white sail
began to ascend the mast; it flapped like thunder in the gentle breeze.
Tom pulled up the anchor, curling the chain round and round on the
forward deck, and then Anna noticed that, although the wind was
scarcely perceptible, they were gliding quickly past the embankment.
Henry was at the tiller. The next minute Tom had set the jib, and by
this time the ``Fay' was approaching the breakwater at a great pace.
There was no rolling or pitching, but simply a smooth, swift
progression over the calm surface. Anna thought it the ideal of
locomotion. As soon as they were beyond the breakwater and the sails
caught the breeze from the Sound, the ``Fay' lay over as if shot, and a
little column of green water flung itself on the lee coaming of the
well. Anna screamed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw the water and felt the angle of the
floor suddenly change, but when everyone laughed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laughed too.
Henry, noticing the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knuckles as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gripped the
coaming, explained the disconcerting phenomena. Anna tried to be at
ease, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not for a long time dismiss the
suspicion that all these people were foolishly blind to a peril which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) alone had the sagacity to perceive.

<p/>They cruised about while Tom prepared the lines. The short waves
chopped cheerfully against the carvel sides of the yacht; the clouds
were breaking at a hundred points; the sea grew lighter in tone; gaiety
was in the air; no one could possibly be indisposed in that innocuous
weather. At length the lines were ready, but Tom said the yacht was
making at least a knot too much for serious fishing, so Henry took a
reef in the mainsail, showing Anna how to tie the short strings. The
Alderman, lying on the fore-deck, was placidly smoking. The lines were
thrown out astern, and Mrs. Sutton and Beatrice each took one. But
they had no success; young Tom said it was because the sun had appeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Caught anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sutton inquired at intervals. After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose Anna and I have a try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What must I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>asked Anna, brave now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You just hold the line--so. And if you feel a little jerk-jerk,
that's a mackerel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>These were the instructions of Beatrice. Anna was
becoming excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not held the line ten seconds before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
cried out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Everyone thinks at first that the motion
of the waves against the line is a fish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Henry, giving the tiller to young Tom. <div class="bookquote">``Let's haul in and
see, anyway.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Before doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) held the line for a moment, testing
it, and winked at Anna. While Anna and Henry were hauling in, the
Alderman, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) pipe, began also to haul in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) own line with
great fury.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got one, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay!''

 (<font color='red'><b>a pounder</b></font>)</div><p/>Both lines came in together, and on each was a pounder. Anna saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
fish gleam and flash like silver in the clear water as it neared the
surface. Henry held the line short, letting the mackerel plunge and
jerk, and then seized and unhooked the catch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna cried, startled at the nearness of the two fish as
they sprang about in an old sugar box at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feet. Young Tom laughed
loud at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclamation. <div class="bookquote">``They cairn't feel, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sniggered.
Anna wondered that a mouth so soft and kind could utter such heartless
words.

<p/>In an hour the united efforts of the party had caught nine mackerel; it
was not a multitude, but the sun, in perfecting the weather, had spoilt
the sport. Anna had ceased to commiserate the captured fish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
obliged, however, to avert her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head when Tom cut some skin from the
side of one of the mackerel to provide fresh bait; this device seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the extremest refinement of cruelty. Beatrice grew ominously
silent and inert, and Mrs. Sutton glanced first at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) daughter and
then at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) husband; the latter nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We'd happen better be getting back, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alderman/Alderman Sutton</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman.

<p/>The ``Fay' swept home like a bird. They were at the quay, and Kelly was
dragging them one by one from the black dinghy on to what the Alderman
called _terra-firma_. Henry had the fish on a string.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How many did ye catch, Miss Tellwright?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Kelly/Kelly</b></font>)</div>Kelly asked benevolently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I caught four,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied. Never before had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt so proud,
elated, and boisterous. Never had the blood so wildly danced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
veins. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) short blue skirt which showed three inches of
ankle, put forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) brown-shod foot like a vain coquette, and darted
a covert look at Henry. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) caught it she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) laughed instead of
blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye're doing well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Kelly/Kelly</b></font>)</div>Tom Kelly approved. <div class="bookquote">``Ye'll make a famous
mackerel-fisher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Kelly/Kelly</b></font>)</div><p/>Five of the mackerel were given to young Tom, the other four preceded a
fowl in the menu of dinner. They were called Anna's mackerel, and all
the diners agreed that better mackerel had never been lured out of the
Irish Sea.

<p/>In the afternoon the Alderman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) wife slept as usual, Mr. Sutton
with a bandanna handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) face. The rest went out
immediately; the invitation of the sun and the sea was far too
persuasive to be resisted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, with a resolute mien. <div class="bookquote">``I want to
paint Bradda Head frightfully. I tried last year, but I got it too
dark, somehow. I've improved since then. What are you going to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll come and watch you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, you won't. At least you won't; you're such a critic. Anna
can if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! And me be left all afternoon by myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, suppose you go with him (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>), Anna, just to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) from being
bored?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna hesitated. Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had the uncomfortable suspicion that
Mynors and herself were being manoeuvred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mynors to Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``Have you decided absolutely to
paint?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The finality of the answer seemed to have a touch of
resentment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then'--he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) turned to Anna--`let's go and get that dinghy and row about
the bay. Eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) could offer no rational objection, and they were soon putting off
from the jetty, impelled seaward by a mighty push from Kelly's arm. It
was very hot. Mynors wore white flannels. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) coat, and
turned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) sleeves, showing thick, hairy arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) sculled in a
manner almost dramatic, and the dinghy shot about like a water-spider
on a brook. Anna had nothing to do except to sit still and enjoy.
Everything was drowned in dazzling sunlight, and both Henry and Anna
could feel the process of tanning on their faces. The bay shimmered
with a million diamond points; it was impossible to keep the eyes open
without frowning, and soon Anna could see the beads of sweat on Henry's
crimson brow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Warm?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. This was the first word of conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) merely
smiled in reply. Presently they were at the other side of the bay, in
a cave whose sandy and rock-strewn floor trembled clear under a fathom
of blue water. They landed on a jutting rock; Henry pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) straw
hat back, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Glorious! glorious!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you swim? No? You should get Beatrice to teach you. I swam out
here this morning at seven o'clock. It was chilly enough then. Oh! I
forgot, I told you at breakfast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in the translucent water, swimming with long,
powerful strokes. Dozens of boats were moving lazily in the bay, each
with a cargo of parasols.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's a good deal of the sunshade afloat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">``Why
haven't you got one? You'll get as brown as Tom Kelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at yourself in the water there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, pointing to a little
pool left on the top of the rock by the tide. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did so, and saw two
fiery cheeks, and a forehead divided by a horizontal line into halves
of white and crimson; the tip of the nose was blistered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it disgraceful?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed, `they'll never know me when I get home!''

<p/>It was in such wise that they talked, endlessly exchanging trifles of
comment. Anna thought to herself: <div class="bookquote">``Is this love-making?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>It could not
be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) decided; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) infinitely preferred it so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was content.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished for nothing better than this apparently frivolous and
irresponsible dalliance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that if Mynors were to be tender,
sentimental, and serious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would become wretchedly self-conscious.

<p/>They re-embarked, and, skirting the shore, gradually came round to the
beach. Up above them, on the cliffs, they could discern the
industrious figure of Beatrice, with easel and sketching-umbrella, and
all the panoply of the earnest amateur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you sketch?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said scornfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you believe in that sort of thing, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right for professional artists,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; `people who can
paint. But-- Well, I suppose it's harmless for the amateurs--finds
them something to do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could paint, anyway,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) retorted.

<p/>``I'm glad you can<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) insisted.

<p/>When they got back to the cliffs, towards tea-time, Beatrice was still
painting, but in a new spot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) seemed entirely absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) work,
and did not hear their approach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's creep up and surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors whispered. <div class="bookquote">``You go first,
and put your hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Beatrice, blindfolded; `how horrid you are, Henry! I
know who it is--I know who it is.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You just don't, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Henry, now in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>). Anna removed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you told her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to do it, I'm sure of that. And I was getting on
so splendidly! I shan't do another stroke now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Henry. <div class="bookquote">``You've wasted quite enough time as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>Beatrice pouted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was evidently annoyed with both of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
looked from one to the other, jealous of their mutual understanding and
agreement. Mr. and Mrs. Sutton issued from the house, and the five
stood chatting till tea was ready; but the shadow remained on
Beatrice's face. Mynors made several attempts to laugh it away, and at
dusk these two went for a stroll to Port St. Mary. They returned in a
state of deep intimacy. During supper Beatrice was consciously and
elaborately angelic, and there was that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) voice and eyes, when
sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) addressed Mynors, which almost persuaded Anna that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
might once have loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) cousin. At night, in the bedroom, Anna
imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could detect in Beatrice's attitude the least shade
of condescension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) felt hurt, and despised herself for feeling hurt.

<p/>So the days passed, without much variety, for the Suttons were not
addicted to excursions. Anna was profoundly happy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had forgotten
care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) agreed to every suggestion for amusement; each moment had
its pleasure, and this pleasure was quite independent of the thing
done; it sprang from all activities and idlenesses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was at special
pains to fraternise with Mr. Sutton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) made an interesting companion,
full of facts about strata, outcrops, and breaks, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) sole weakness
being the habit of quoting extremely sentimental scraps of verse when
walking by the sea-shore. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) frankly enjoyed Anna's attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>),
and took pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) society. Mrs. Sutton, that simple heart, devoted
herself to the attainment of absolute quiescence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had come for a
rest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) achieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) purpose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) kindliness became for the time
passive instead of active. Beatrice was a changing quantity in the
domestic equation. Plainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) parents had spoiled their only child,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had frequent fits of petulance, particularly with Mynors; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) energy and spirits atoned well for these. As for Mynors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
behaved exactly as on the first Monday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) spent many hours alone with
Anna---LRB-Beatrice appeared to insist on leaving them together, even while
showing a faint resentment at the loneliness thus entailed on
herself-RRB---and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) attitude was such as Anna, ignorant of the ways of
brothers, deemed a brother might adopt.

<p/>On the second Monday an incident occurred. In the afternoon Mr. Sutton
had asked Beatrice to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) to Port St. Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had refused
on the plea that the light was of a suitable grey for painting. Mr.
Sutton had slipped off alone, unseen by Anna and Henry, who had meant
to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in place of Beatrice. Before tea, while Anna,
Beatrice and Henry were awaiting the meal in the parlour, Mynors
referred to the matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you've done some decent work this afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said to
Beatrice.

<p/>``I haven``t,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) replied shortly; <div class="bookquote">``I haven't done a stroke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said you were going to paint hard!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, I didn<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why couldn't you have gone to Port St. Mary, instead of breaking
your fond father's heart by a refusal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't want me, really.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna interjected: <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, Bee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you're very self-willed, not to say selfish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'm not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice protested seriously. <div class="bookquote">``Am I, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well--' Anna tried to think of a diplomatic pronouncement.
Beatrice took offence at the hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You two are bound to agree, of course. You're as thick as
thieves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) gazed steadily out of the window, and there was a silence. Mynors'
lip curled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! There's the loveliest yacht just coming into the bay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice
cried suddenly, in a tone of affected enthusiasm. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going out to
sketch it.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) hat and sketching-block, and ran
hastily from the room. The other two saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) sitting on the grass,
sharpening a pencil. The yacht, a large and luxurious craft, had
evidently come to anchor for the night.

<p/>Mrs. Sutton arrived from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) bedroom, and then Mr. Sutton also came in.
Tea was served. Mynors called to Beatrice through the window and
received no reply. Then Mrs. Sutton summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on with your tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice shouted, without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't wait for me. I'm bound to finish this now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), Anna dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton after another interval. Anna
rose to obey, half-fearful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you coming in, Bee?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood by the sketcher's side, and
observed nothing but a few meaningless lines on the block.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you hear what I said to mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna retired in discomfiture.

<p/>Tea was finished. They went out, but kept at a discreet distance from
the artist, who continued to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pencil until dusk had fallen.
Then they returned to the sitting-room, where a fire had been lighted,
and Beatrice at length followed. As the others sat in a circle round
the fire, Beatrice, who occupied the sofa in solitude, gave a shiver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beatrice, you've taken cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother, sitting out there like
that.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense, mother--what a fidget you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fidget I certainly am not, my darling, and that you know very well.
As you've had no tea, you shall have some gruel at once, and go to bed
and get warm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>But Mrs. Sutton was resolved, and in half an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
had taken Beatrice to bed and tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) up.

<p/>When Anna went to the bedroom Beatrice was awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) inquired kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, in a feeble voice, <div class="bookquote">``I'm restless, somehow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if it's influenza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, on the following
morning, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) learnt from Anna that Beatrice had had a bad night,
and would take breakfast in bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) carried the invalid's food
upstairs herself. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it isn't influenza,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said later. <div class="bookquote">``The
girl is very hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't a clinical thermometer?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors suggested.

<p/>``Go, see if you can buy one at the little chemist<div class="bookquote">``s,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) replied
eagerly. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) came back with the instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s at over a hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton reported, having used the
thermometer. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say, father? Shall we send for a doctor?
I'm not so set up with doctors as a general rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) added, as if in
defence, to Anna. <div class="bookquote">``I brought Beatrice through measles and scarlet
fever without a doctor--we never used to think of having a doctor in
those days for ordinary ailments; but influenza--that's different. Eh,
I dread it; you never know how it will end. And poor Beatrice had such
a bad attack last Martinmas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like, I'll run for a doctor now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let be till to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alderman/Alderman Sutton</b></font>)</div>the Alderman decided. <div class="bookquote">``We'll see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) goes
on. Happen it's nothing but a cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>assented Mrs. Sutton; `it's no use crying out before you're
hurt.''

<p/>Anna was struck by the placidity with which they covered their
apprehension. Towards noon, Beatrice, who said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) felt better,
insisted on rising. A fire was lighted at once in the parlour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
sat in front of it till tea-time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was obliged to go to bed
again. On the Wednesday morning, after a night which had been almost
sleepless for both girls, her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) temperature stood at 103°, and Henry
fetched the doctor, who pronounced it a case of influenza, severe,
demanding very careful treatment. Instantly the normal movement of the
household was changed. The sickroom became a mysterious centre round
which everything revolved, and the parlour, without the alteration of a
single chair, took on a deserted, forlorn appearance. Meals were eaten
like the passover, with loins girded for any sudden summons. Mrs.
Sutton and Anna, as nurses, grew important in the eyes of the men, who
instinctively effaced themselves, existing only like messenger-boys
whose business it is to await a call. Yet there was no alarm, flurry,
nor excitement. In the evening the doctor returned. The patient's
temperature had not fallen. It was part of the treatment that a
medicine should be administered every two hours with absolute
regularity, and Mrs. Sutton said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) should sit up through the
night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I won't hear of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton replied, smiling.

<p/>But the three men -LRB-the doctor had remained to chat in the parlour-RRB-,
recognising Anna's capacity and reliability, and perhaps impressed also
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) business-like appearance as, arrayed in a white apron, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stood
with firm lips before them, gave a unanimous decision against Mrs.
Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We`st have you ill next, lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alderman/Alderman Sutton</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman to his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) wife; `and
that'll never do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton surrendered, `if I can leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) to anyone, it's
Anna.''

<p/>Mynors smiled appreciatively.

<p/>On the Thursday morning there was still no sign of recovery. The
temperature was 104°, and the patient slightly delirious. Anna left
the sickroom at eight o'clock to preside at breakfast, and Mrs. Sutton
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look tired, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman affectionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel perfectly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) replied with cheerfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you aren't afraid of catching it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said; `there's no fear of me catching it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, that's all. I'm never ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the right way to keep well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div>the Alderman remarked.

<p/>The quiet admiration of these two men was very pleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had established herself for ever in their esteem. After
breakfast, in obedience to them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) slept for several hours on Mrs.
Sutton's bed. In the afternoon Beatrice was worse. The doctor called,
and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) temperature at 105°.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This can't last,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) remarked briefly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sutton said, `it's i' your hands.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton murmured with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``I've left it with God. It's
with Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the first and only word of religion, except grace at table,
that Anna heard from the Suttons during her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stay in the Isle of Man.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had feared lest vocal piety might form a prominent feature of their
daily life, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fear had proved groundless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), too, from reason
rather than instinct, had tried to pray for Beatrice's recovery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
had, however, found much more satisfaction in the activity of nursing.

<p/>Again that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) sat up, and on the Friday morning Beatrice was
better. At noon all immediate danger was past; the patient slept; her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
temperature was almost correct. Anna went to bed in the afternoon and
slept soundly till supper-time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) awoke very hungry. For the
first time in three days Beatrice could be left alone. The other four
had supper together, cheerful and relieved after the tension.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>)'ll be as right as a trivet in a few days,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A few weeks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, `you'll stay on here, now?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall stay until Beatrice is quite fit to travel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sutton
answered. <div class="bookquote">``I might have to run over to th' Five Towns for a day or two
middle of next week, but I can come back immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must go tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you can stay over Sunday, Henry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I've no one to take my place at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I must go to-morrow, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiddle-de-dee, Anna!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div>the Alderman protested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) insisted. <div class="bookquote">``Father will expect me. You know I came for a
fortnight. Besides, there's Agnes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes will be all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was fixed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't a short walk do you good?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), with
singular gravity, after supper. <div class="bookquote">``You've not been outside for two days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked inquiringly at Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), Henry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)'ll sleep better for it. Eh, Anna, but it's
a shame to send you home with those rings round your eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) went upstairs for a jacket. Beatrice was awake. <div class="bookquote">``Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
exclaimed in a weak voice, without any preface, <div class="bookquote">``I was awfully silly
and cross the other afternoon, before all this business. Just now,
when you came into the room, I was feeling quite ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Bee!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) answered, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), `what nonsense! Now go off
to sleep at once.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was very happy. Beatrice, victim of a
temperament which had the childishness and the impulsiveness of the
artist without his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) higher and sterner traits, sank back in facile
content.

<p/>The night was still and very dark. When Anna and Mynors got outside
they could distinguish neither the sky nor the sea; but the faint,
restless murmur of the sea came up the cliffs. Only the lights of the
houses disclosed the direction of the road.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose we go down to the jetty, and then along as far as the
breakwater?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) concurred. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you take my
muffler--again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) added, pulling this ever-present article from his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thanks,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, almost coldly, `it's really quite warm.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
regarded the offer of the muffler as an indiscretion--his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) sole
indiscretion during their acquaintance. As they walked down the hill
to the shore she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) though how Beatrice's illness had sharply interrupted
their relations. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had come to the Isle of Man with a vague idea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) would possibly propose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>), the expectation was
disappointed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) felt no disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) felt that events had
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) to a higher plane than that of love-making. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) was filled
with the proud satisfaction of a duty accomplished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) did not seek
to minimise to herself the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) had been of real value to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>)
friends in the last few days, had probably saved Mrs. Sutton from
illness, had certainly laid them all under an obligation. Their
gratitude, unexpressed, but patent on each face, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) infinite
pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had won their respect by the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had
risen to the height of an emergency that demanded more than devotion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had proved, not merely to them but to herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) could be
calm under stress, and could exert moral force when occasion needed.
Such were the joyous and exultant reflections which passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)
brain--unnaturally active in the factitious wakefulness caused by
excessive fatigue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) was in an extremely nervous and excitable
condition--and never guessed it, fancying indeed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) emotions were
exceptionally tranquil that night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had not begun to realise the
crisis through which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had just lived.

<p/>The uneven road to the ruined breakwater was quite deserted. Having
reached the limit of the path, they stood side by side, solitary,
silent, gazing at the black and gently heaving surface of the sea. The
eye was foiled by the intense gloom; the ear could make nothing of the
strange night-noises of the bay and the ocean beyond; but the
imagination was stimulated by the appeal of all this mystery and
darkness. Never had the water seemed so wonderful, terrible, and
austere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are going away to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said at length.

<p/>Anna started and shook with apprehension at the tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) voice.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had read that a woman was always well warned by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instincts when
a man meant to propose to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But here was the proposal imminent, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not suspected. In a flash of insight she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perceived that the
very event which had separated them for three days had also impelled
the lover forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) course. It was the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vigils, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
fortitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) compassion, that had fanned the flame. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not
surprised, only made uncomfortable, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, `it's no use making a long story of it. I'm
tremendously in love with you; you know I am.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) stepped back, still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) ventured. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought--I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured stupidly, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you liked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you how I admire you. I'm not going to praise you to
your face, but I simply never met anyone like you. From the very first
moment I saw you, it was the same. It's something in your face,
Anna-- Anna, will you be my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The actual question was put in a precise, polite, somewhat conventional
tone. To Anna he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was never more himself than at that moment.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not speak; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not analyse her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not
even think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was adrift. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stammered: ``We've only known
each other--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) exclaimed masterfully, `what does that matter? If it
had been a dozen years instead of one, that would have made no
difference.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand timidly away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) took it again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and would decide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Say yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw pictures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) career as his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wife, and resolved that one of
the first acts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) freedom should be to release Agnes from the more
ignominious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's tyrannies.

<p/>They walked home almost in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was engaged, then. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
experienced no new sensation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had felt on the way
down, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was sorely perturbed. There was no ineffable
rapture, no ecstatic bliss. Suddenly the prospect of happiness swept
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) like a flood.

<p/>At the gate she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished to make a request to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but hesitated, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not bring herself to use his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Christian name. It was proper
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to use his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) Christian name, however, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would do so, or
perish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, `don't tell anyone here.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) merely kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) once
more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went straight upstairs.




<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>THE DOWNFALL

<p/>In order to catch the Liverpool steamer at Douglas it was necessary to
leave Port Erin at half-past six in the morning. The freshness of the
morning, and the smiles of the Alderman and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) wife as they waved
God-speed from the doorstep, filled Anna with a serene content which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) certainly had not felt during the wakeful night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot, then,
the hours passed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) conscience in realising how serious and
solemn a thing was this engagement, made in an instant on the previous
evening. All that remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and Henry walked
quickly down the road, was the tonic sensation of high resolves to be a
worthy wife. The duties, rather than the joys, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) condition, had
lain nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart until that moment of setting out, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) an
anxious and almost worried mien which at breakfast neither Henry nor
the Suttons could quite understand. But now the idea of duty ceased
for a time to be paramount, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loosed herself to the pleasures of
the day in store. The harbour was full of low wandering mists, through
which the brown sails of the fishing-smacks played at hide-and-seek.
High above them the round forms of immense clouds were still carrying
the colours of sunrise. The gentle salt wind on the cheek was like the
touch of a life-giver. It was impossible, on such a morning, not to
exult in life, not to laugh childishly from irrational glee, not to
dismiss the memory of grief and the apprehension of grief as morbid
hallucinations. Mynor's face expressed the double happiness of present
and anticipated pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had once again succeeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) who had
never failed; and the voyage back to England was for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) a triumphal
progress. Anna responded eagerly to his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mood. The day was an ecstasy,
a bright expanse unstained. To Anna in particular it was a unique day,
marking the apogee of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) existence. In the years that followed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
could always return to it and say to herself: <div class="bookquote">``That day I was happy,
foolishly, ignorantly, but utterly. And all that I have since learnt
cannot alter it--I was happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When they reached Shawport Station a cab was waiting for Anna. Unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), Henry had ordered it by telegraph. This considerateness was of
a piece, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) masterly conduct of the entire
journey--on the steamer, at Liverpool, in the train; nothing that an
experienced traveller could devise had been lacking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) comfort.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) got into the cab alone, while Mynors, followed by a boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
bag, walked to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rooms in Mount Street. It had been arranged, at
Anna's wish, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should not appear at Manor Terrace till
supper-time. Ephraim opened for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) home. It seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) was pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, father, here I am again, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, lass.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They shook hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) indicated to the cabman where to
deposit her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tin-box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad and relieved to be back. Nothing
had changed, except herself, and this absolute sameness was at once
pleasant and pathetic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where's Agnes?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father. In the glow of
arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had a vague notion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) relations with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
permanently softened by absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see thou's gotten into th' habit o' flitting about in cabs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
said, without answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, smiling yet, `there was the box. I couldn't
carry the box.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I reckon thou couldst ha' hired a lad to carry it for sixpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not reply. The cabman had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) vehicle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Art`na going to pay th' cabby?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've paid him (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>), father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``Eighteen-pence, father.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a lie; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had paid two
shillings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went eagerly into the kitchen, and then into the parlour, where tea
was set for one. Agnes was not there. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)'s upstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Ephraim said,
meeting Anna as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) came into the lobby again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran softly
upstairs, and into the bedroom. Agnes was replacing ornaments on the
mantelpiece with mathematical exactitude; under her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) arm was a duster.
The child turned, startled, and gave a little shriek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I didn't know you'd come. How early you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They rushed towards each other, embraced, and kissed. Anna was
overcome by the pathos of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sister's loneliness in that grim house
for fourteen days, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), the elder, had been absorbed in selfish
gaiety. The pale face, large, melancholy eyes, and long, thin arms,
were a silent accusation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could ever have
brought herself to leave Agnes even for a day. Sitting down on the
bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) drew the child on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) knee in a fury of love, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
again, weeping. Agnes cried too, for sympathy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, dear Anna, I'm so glad you've come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
eyes, and in quite a different tone of voice asked: <div class="bookquote">``Has Mr. Mynors
proposed to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna could not avoid a blush at this simple and astounding query. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
said: <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>It was the one word of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was capable, under the
circumstances. That was not the moment to tax Agnes with too much
precocity and abruptness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're engaged, then? Oh, Anna, does it feel nice? It must. I knew
you would be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How did you know, Agnes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would ask you, some time. All the girls at school
knew too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you didn't talk about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sister</b></font>)</div>said the elder sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, _no_! But they did; they were always talking about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You never told me that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I didn't like to. Anna, shall I have to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) Henry now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course. When we're married he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) will be your brother-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be married soon, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for a very long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you are--shall I keep house alone? I can, you know-- I shall
never _dare_ to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) Henry. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s awfully nice; isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Anna?
Yes, when you are married, I shall keep house here, but I shall come to
see you every day. Father will _have_ to let me do that. Does father
know you're engaged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. And you mustn't say anything. Henry is coming for supper.
And then father will be told.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kiss you, Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who--father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, silly! Henry, of course--I mean when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'d asked you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are asking all the questions. Suppose I ask you some now.
How have you managed with father? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) been nice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some days--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>said Agnes, after thinking a moment. ``We have had
some new cups and saucers up from Mr. Mynors works. And father has
swept the kitchen chimney. And, oh Anna! I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to-day if I'd
kept house well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said ``Pretty well,<div class="bookquote">'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) gave me a penny.
Look! It's the first money I've ever had, you know. I wanted you at
nights, Anna--and all the time, too. I've been frightfully busy. I
cleaned silvers all afternoon. Anna, I _have_ tried-- And I've got
some tea for you. I'll go down and make it. Now you mustn't come into
the kitchen. I'll bring it to you in the parlour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had my tea at Crewe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna was about to say, but refrained, in due
course drinking the cup prepared by Agnes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) felt passionately sorry
for Agnes, too young to feel the shadow which overhung her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) future.
Anna would marry into freedom, but Agnes would remain the serf. Would
Agnes marry? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)? Would her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father allow it? Anna had noticed
that in families the youngest, petted in childhood, was often
sacrificed in maturity. It was the last maid who must keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
maidenhood, and, vicariously filial, pay out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own life the debt
of all the rest.

<p/>``Mr. Mynors is coming up for supper to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) wants to see you;'
Anna said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, as calmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could. The miser grunted.
But at eight o'clock, the hour immutably fixed for supper, Henry had
not arrived. The meal proceeded, of course, without him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). To Anna his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
absence was unaccountable and disturbing, for none could be more
punctilious than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in the matter of appointments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
every moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not appear. Agnes, filled full of the great
secret confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), was more openly impatient than her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) sister.
Neither of them could talk, and a heavy silence fell upon the family
group, a silence which her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father, on that particular evening of Anna's
return, resented.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You dunna' tell us much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remarked, when the supper was finished.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt that the complaint was a just one. Even before supper, when
nothing had occurred to preoccupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had spoken little. There
had seemed so much to tell--at Port Erin, and now there seemed nothing
to tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) ventured into a flaccid, perfunctory account of
Beatrice's illness, of the fishing, of the unfinished houses which had
caught the fancy of Mr. Sutton; she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) said the sea had been smooth, that
they had had something to eat at Liverpool, that the train for Crewe
was very prompt; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) could think of no more. Silence fell
again. The supper-things were cleared away and washed up. At a
quarter-past nine, Agnes, vainly begging permission to stay up in order
to see Mr. Mynors, was sent to bed, only partially comforted by a
clothes-brush, long desired, which Anna had brought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as a
present from the Isle of Man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you tell father yourself, now Henry hasn't come?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child
asked Anna, who had gone upstairs to unpack her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, briefly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'ll say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes reflected, with that habit, always
annoying to Anna, of meeting trouble half-way.

<p/>At a quarter to ten Anna ceased to expect Mynors, and finally braced
herself to the ordeal of a solemn interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, well
knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dared not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) any longer in ignorance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
engagement. Already the old man was locking and bolting the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had wound up the kitchen clock. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back to the parlour to
extinguish the gas she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was standing by the mantelpiece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I've something I must tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, what's that ye say?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand was on the gas-tap. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped it,
examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face curiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors has asked me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) asked me last night. We
settled he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) should come up to-night to see you--I can't think why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
hasn't. It must be something very unexpected and important, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'d
have come.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart beat violently; but the words were
out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thanked God.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Asked ye to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>), did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>The miser</b></font>)</div>The miser gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) quizzically
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) small blue eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what didst say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Thou saidst thou wouldst! I reckon it was for thatten as thou
must go gadding off to seaside, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I never dreamt of such a thing when Suttons asked me to go. I
do wish Henry'--the cost of that Christian name!--`had come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) quite
meant to come to-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not help insisting on the propriety
of Henry's intentions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am for be consulted, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ye've soon made it up, between ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tone was, at the best, brusque; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) breathed more easily,
divining instantly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) manner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) meant to offer no violent
objection to the engagement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that only tact was needed now.
The miser had, indeed, foreseen the possibility of this marriage for
months past, and had long since decided in his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) own mind that Henry
would make a satisfactory son-in-law. Ephraim had no social
ambitions--with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) meanness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) was above them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) had nothing but
contempt for rank, style, luxury, and `the theory of what it is to be a
lady and a gentleman.'' Yet, by a curious contradiction, Henry's
smartness of appearance--the smartness of an unrivalled commercial
traveller--pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) saw in Henry a young and sedate man of
remarkable shrewdness, a man who had saved money, had made money for
others, and was now making it for himself; a man who could be trusted
absolutely to perform that feat of `getting on'; a `safe' and
profoundly respectable man, at the same time audacious and
imperturbable. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was well aware that Henry had really fallen in love
with Anna, but nothing would have convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that Anna's money was
not the primal cause of Henry's genuine passion for Anna's self.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like Henry, don't you, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said. It was a failure in
the desired tact, for Ephraim had never been known to admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>)
liked anyone or anything. Such natures are capable of nothing more
positive than toleration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s a hard-headed chap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knows the value o' money. Ay! that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
does; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knows which side his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bread's buttered on.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A sinister
emphasis marked the last sentence.

<p/>Instead of remaining silent, Anna, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nervousness, committed
another imprudence. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, pretending
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought it impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) could mean what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) obviously did mean.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou knows what I'm at, lass. Dost think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isna' marrying thee for
thy brass? Dost think as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) canna' make a fine guess what thou`rt
worth? But that wunna' bother thee as long as thou`st hooked a
good-looking chap.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! thou mayst bridle; but it's true. Dunna' tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Securely conscious of the perfect purity of Mynors' affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was
not in the least hurt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) even thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's attitude was
not quite sincere, an attitude partially due to mere wilful
churlishness. <div class="bookquote">``Henry has never even mentioned money to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said
mildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happen not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) isna' such a fool as that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) paused, and continued:
<div class="bookquote">``Thou`rt free to wed, for me. Lasses will do it, I reckon, and thee
among th' rest.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) smiled, and on that smile he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suddenly turned out
the gas. Anna was glad that the colloquy had ended so well.
Congratulations, endearments, loving regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) welfare: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
not expected these things, and was in no wise grieved by their absence.
Groping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) way towards the lobby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) considered herself lucky, and
only wished that nothing had happened to keep Mynors away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father had proved tractable.


<p/>The next morning, Tellwright, whose attendance at chapel was losing the
strictness of its old regularity, announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) should stay at
home. Sunday's dinner was to be a cold repast, and so Anna and Agnes
went to chapel. Anna's thoughts were wholly occupied with the prospect
of seeing Mynors, and hearing the explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) absence on
Saturday night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes exclaimed loudly, as they were approaching the
chapel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, `when will you learn to behave in the street?''

<p/>Mynors stood at the chapel-gates; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was evidently awaiting them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
looked grave, almost sad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) hat and shook hands, with a
particular friendliness for Agnes, who was speculating whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would
kiss Anna, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) betrothed, or herself, as being only a little girl,
or both or neither of them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes already expressed a sort of
ownership in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to speak to you a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry said. <div class="bookquote">``Will you come
into the school-yard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agnes, you had better go straight into chapel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. It was an
ignominious disaster to the child, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) obeyed.

<p/>``I didn't give you up last night till nearly ten o<div class="bookquote">``clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Anna
remarked as they passed into the school-yard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was astonished to
discover in herself an inclination to pout, to play the offended fair
one, because Mynors had failed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) appointment. Contemptuously she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
crushed it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard about Mr. Price?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors began.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)? Has anything happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``A very sad thing has happened. Yes--' He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) stopped, from emotion.
<div class="bookquote">``Our superintendent has committed suicide!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Killed himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna gasped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) hanged himself yesterday afternoon at Edward Street, in the
slip-house after the works were closed. Willie had gone home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
came back, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father didn't turn up for dinner, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>).
Mr. Price was quite dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) ran in to my place to fetch me just as I
was getting my tea. That was why I never came last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna was speechless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I would tell you myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry resumed. <div class="bookquote">``It's an awful
thing for the Sunday-school, and the whole society, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), a
prominent Wesleyan, a worker among us! An awful thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeated,
dominated by the idea of the blow thus dealt to the Methodist connexion
by the man now dead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna demanded, curtly.

<p/>Mynors shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) shoulders, and ejaculated: <div class="bookquote">``Business troubles, I
suppose; it couldn't be anything else. At school this morning I simply
announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry's voice broke, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) added, after
a pause: <div class="bookquote">``Young Price bore himself splendidly last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna turned away in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I shall come up for tea, if I may,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry said, and then they parted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to the singing-seat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to the
portico of the chapel. People were talking in groups on the broad
steps and in the vestibule. All knew of the calamity, and had received
from it a new interest in life. The town was aroused as if from a
lethargy. Consternation and eager curiosity were on every face. Those
who arrived in ignorance of the event were informed of it in impressive
tones, and with intense satisfaction to the informer; nothing of equal
importance had happened in the society for decades. Anna walked up the
aisle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pew, filled with one thought:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) to it, father and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fear was that the miser had renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) terrible insistence during
the previous fortnight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had disliked the dead man,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mean, pietistic, and two-faced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
forgot that in pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for rent many months overdue she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father had acted within their just rights--acted as Price himself would
have acted in their place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could think only of the strain, the
agony, the despair that must have preceded the miserable tragedy. Old
Price had atoned for all in one sublime sin, the sole deed that could
lend dignity and repose to such a figure as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Anna's feverish
imagination reconstituted the scene in the slip-house: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw it as
something grand, accusing, and unanswerable; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not dismiss
a feeling of acute remorse that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) should have been engaged in
pleasure at that very hour of death. Surely some instinct should have
warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that the hare which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had helped to hunt was at its last
gasp!

<p/>Mr. Sargent, the newly-appointed second minister, was in the pulpit--a
little, earnest bachelor, who emphasised every sentence with a
continual tremor of the voice. <div class="bookquote">``Brethren,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) said, after the second
hymn--and his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) tones vibrated with a singular effect through the
half-empty building: <div class="bookquote">``Before I proceed to my sermon I have one word to
say in reference to the awful event which is doubtless uppermost in the
minds of all of you. It is not for us to judge the man who is now gone
from us, ushered into the dread presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Maker with the crime of
self-murder upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul. I say it is not for us to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The
ways of the Almighty are past finding out. Therefore at such a moment
we may fitly humble ourselves before the Throne, and while prostrate
there let us intercede for the poor young man who is left behind,
bereft, and full of grief and shame. We will engage in silent prayer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) hand, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) eyes, and the congregation leaned
forward against the fronts of the pews. The appealing face of Willie
presented itself vividly to Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes asked, in a whisper of appalling distinctness. Anna
frowned angrily, and gave no reply.

<p/>While the last hymn was being sung, Anna signed to Agnes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
wished to leave the chapel. Everyone would be aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was among
Price's creditors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feared that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stayed till the end of
the service some chatterer might draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) into a distressing
conversation. The sisters went out, and Agnes's burning curiosity was
at length relieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Price has hanged himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father when they
reached home.

<p/>The miser looked through the window for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I am na'
surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) said. ``Suicide's i' that blood. Titus's uncle <div class="bookquote">``Lijah
tried to kill himself twice afore he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) died o' gravel. Us'n have to do
summat wi' Edward Street at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wanted to ask Ephraim if he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) had been demanding more rent lately,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not find courage to do so.

<p/>Agnes had to go to Sunday-school alone that afternoon. Without saying
anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father, Anna decided to stay at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spent the
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bedroom, idle, preoccupied; and did not come downstairs
till half-past three. Ephraim had gone out. Agnes presently returned,
and then Henry came in with Mr. Tellwright. They were conversing
amicably, and Anna knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) engagement was finally and
satisfactorily settled. During tea no reference was made to it, nor to
the suicide. Mynors' demeanour was quiet but cheerful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had partly
recovered from the morning's agitation, and gave Ephraim and Agnes a
vivacious account of the attractions of Port Erin. Anna noticed the
amusement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) eyes when Agnes, reddening, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Will you
have some more bread-and-butter, Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It seemed to be tacitly
understood afterwards that Agnes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father would attend chapel,
while Henry and Anna kept house. No one was ingenious enough to detect
an impropriety in the arrangement. For some obscure reason,
immediately upon the departure of the chapel-goers, Anna went into the
kitchen, rattled some plates, stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hair mechanically, and then
stole back again to the parlour. It was a chilly evening, and instead
of walking up and down the strip of garden the betrothed lovers sat
together under the window. Anna wondered whether or not she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was happy.
The presence of Mynors was, at any rate, marvellously soothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did your father say anything about the Price affair?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) began,
yielding at once to the powerful hypnotism of the subject which
fascinated the whole town that night, and which Anna could bear neither
to discuss nor to ignore.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, and repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's remark.

<p/>Mynors told her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) knew; how Willie had discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) toes actually touching the floor, leaning slightly forward, quite
dead; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had then cut the rope and fetched Mynors, who went with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to the police-station; how they had tied up the head of the corpse,
and then waited till night to wheel the body on a hand-cart from Edward
Street to the mortuary chamber at the police-station; how the police
had telephoned to the coroner, and settled at once that the inquest
should be held on Tuesday in the court-room at the town-hall; and how
quiet, self-contained, and dignified Willie had been, surprising
everyone by this new-found manliness. It all seemed hideously real to
Anna, as Henry added detail to detail.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I ought to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said very calmly, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
finished the recital, `that I--I'm dreadfully upset over it. I can't
help thinking that I--that father and I, I mean--are somehow partly
responsible for this.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Price's death? How?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been so hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rent lately, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest girl! What next?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I assure you
the idea is absurd. You've only got it because you're so sensitive and
high-strung. I undertake to say Price was stuck fast
everywhere--everywhere--hadn't a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me high-strung!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lovingly. But, beneath
the feeling of reassurance, which by superior force he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had imposed on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), there lay a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was treated like a frightened child
who must be tranquillized in the night. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was grateful
for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kindness, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) obtained relief from the
returning obsession of the suicide by making anew her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) vows to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>As a theatrical effect the death of Titus Price could scarcely have
been surpassed. The town was profoundly moved by the spectacle of this
abject yet heroic surrender of all those pretences by which society
contrives to tolerate itself. Here was a man whom no one respected,
but everyone pretended to respect--who knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was respected by
none, but pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was respected by all; whose whole career
was made up of dissimulations: religious, moral, and social. If any
man could have been trusted to continue the decent sham to the end, and
so preserve the general self-esteem, surely it was this man. But no!
Suddenly abandoning all imposture, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) transgresses openly, brazenly;
and, snatching a bit of hemp cries: <div class="bookquote">``Behold me; this is real human
nature. This is the truth; the rest was lies. I lied; you lied. I
confess it, and you shall confess it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Such a thunderclap shakes the
very base of the microcosm. The young folk in particular could with
difficulty believe their ears. It seemed incredible to them that Titus
Price, the Methodist, the Sunday-school superintendent, the loud
champion of the highest virtues, should commit the sin of all
sins--murder. They were dazed. The remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) insincerity did
nothing to mitigate the blow. In their view it was perhaps even worse
that he (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) had played false to his (<font color='blue'><b>champion</b></font>) own falsity. The elders were a little
less disturbed. The event was not unique in their experience. They
had lived longer and felt these seismic shocks before. They could go
back into the past and find other cases where a swift impulse had
shattered the edifice of a lifetime. They knew that the history of
families and of communities is crowded with disillusion. They had
discovered that character is changeless, irrepressible, incurable.
They were aware of the astonishing fact, which takes at least thirty
years to learn, that a Sunday-school superintendent is a man. And the
suicide of Titus Price, when they had realised it, served but to
confirm their most secret and honest estimate of humanity, that
estimate which they never confided to a soul. The young folk thought
the Methodist Society shamed and branded by the tragic incident, and
imagined that years must elapse before it could again hold up its head
in the town. The old folk were wiser, foreseeing with certainty that
in only a few days this all-engrossing phenomenon would lose its
significance, and be as though it had never been. Even in two days,
time had already begun its work, for by Tuesday morning the interest of
the affair--on Sunday at the highest pitch--had waned so much that the
thought of the inquest was capable of reviving it. Although everyone
knew that the case presented no unusual features, and that the
coroner's inquiry would be nothing more than a formal ceremony, the
almost greedy curiosity of Methodist circles lifted it to the level of
a _cause célèbre_. The court was filled with irreproachable
respectability when the coroner drove into the town, and each animated
face said to its fellow: <div class="bookquote">``So you're here, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>Late comers of the
official world--councillors, guardians of the poor, members of the
school board, and one or two of their ladies, were forced to intrigue
for room with the police and the town-hall keeper, and, having
succeeded, sank into their narrow seats with a sigh of expectancy and
triumph. Late comers with less influence had to retire, and by a kind
of sinister fascination were kept wandering about the corridor before
they could decide to go home. The market-place was occupied by
hundreds of loafers, who seemed to find a mystic satisfaction in
beholding the coroner's dogcart and the exterior of the building which
now held the corpse.

<p/>It was by accident that Anna was in the town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that the
inquest was to occur that morning, but had not dreamed of attending it.
When, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw the stir of excitement in the market-place, and
the police guarding the entrances of the town-hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked directly
across the road, past the two officers at the east door, and into the
dark main corridor of the building, which was dotted with small groups
idly conversing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was conscious of two things: a vehement
curiosity, and the existence somewhere in the precincts of a dead body,
unsightly, monstrous, calm, silent, careless--the insensible origin of
all this simmering ferment which disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shared in
it. At a small door, half hidden by a curtain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was startled to see
Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed, as if painfully surprised, and shook hands
with a preoccupied air. <div class="bookquote">``They are examining Willie. I came outside
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was in the witness-box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the inquest going on in there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked, pointing to the door.
Each appeared to be concealing a certain resentment against the other;
but this appearance was due only to nervous agitation.

<p/>A policeman down the corridor called: <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Mynors, a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>A policeman Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry
hurried away, answering Anna's question as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, in there.
That's the witnesses' and jurors' door; but please don't go in. I
don't like you to, and it is sure to upset you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened the door and went in. None said nay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found a few
inches of standing-room behind the jury-box. A terrible stench
nauseated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>); the chamber was crammed, and not a window open. There
was silence in the court--no one seemed to be doing anything; but at
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived that the coroner, enthroned on the bench justice was
writing in a book with blue leaves. In the witness-box stood William
Price, dressed in black, with kid gloves, not lounging in an ungainly
attitude, as might have been expected, but perfectly erect; he (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>)
eyes fixed on the coroner's head. Sarah Vodrey, Price's aged
housekeeper, sat on a chair near the witness-box, weeping into a
black-bordered handkerchief; at intervals she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) small,
wrinkled, red face, with its glistening, inflamed eyes, and then buried
it again in the handkerchief. The members of the jury, whom Anna could
see only in profile, shuffled to and fro on their long, pew-like
seats--they were mostly working men, shabbily clothed; but the foreman
was Mr. Leal, the provision dealer, a freemason, and a sidesman at the
parish church. The general public sat intent and vacuous; their minds
gaped, if not their mouths; occasionally one whispered inaudibly to
another; the jury, conscious of an official status, exchanged remarks
in a whisper courageously loud. Several tall policemen, helmet in
hand, stood in various corners of the room, and the coroner's officer
sat near the witness-box to administer the oath. At length the coroner
lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) was rather a young man, with a large, intelligent
face; he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) wore eyeglasses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) chin was covered with a short, wavy
beard. His (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) manner showed that, while secretly proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) supreme
position in that assemblage, he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) was deliberately trying to make it
appear that this exercise of judicial authority was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>),
that in truth these eternal inquiries, which interested others so
deeply, were to him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) a weariness conscientiously endured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>the coroner said blandly, and it was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>)
was being ceremoniously polite to an inferior, in obedience to the
rules of good form, <div class="bookquote">``I must ask you some more questions. They may be
inconvenient, even painful; but I am here simply as the instrument of
the law, and I must do my duty. And these gentlemen here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) waved a
hand in the direction of the jury, `must be told the whole facts of the
case. We know, of course, that the deceased committed suicide--that
has been proved beyond doubt; but, as I say, we have the right to know
more.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) paused, well satisfied with the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) voice, and
evidently thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) had said something very weighty and
impressive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want to know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>Willie Price demanded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) broad Five Towns
speech contrasting with the Kensingtonian accents of the coroner. The
latter, who came originally from Manchester, was irritated by the
brusque interruption; but he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) annoyance, at the same time
glancing at the public as if to signify to them that he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) had learnt not
to take too seriously the unintentional rudeness characteristic of
their district.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say it was probably business troubles that caused your late father
to commit the rash act?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure there was nothing else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else could there be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your late father was a widower?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now as to these business troubles--what were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We were being pressed by creditors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you a partner with your late father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You were a partner with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div><p/>The jury seemed surprised, and the coroner wrote again: <div class="bookquote">``What was your
share in the business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know? Surely that is rather singular?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father took me in Co. not long since. We signed a deed, but I
forget what was in it. My place was principally on the bank, not in
the office.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so you were being pressed by creditors?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. And we were behind with the rent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the landlord pressing you, too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes, fearful lest every head had turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not then; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been--she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The landlord is a lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>Here the coroner faintly smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Then, as
regards the landlord, the pressure was less than it had been?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we had paid some rent, and settled some other claims.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it not seem strange--?''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>the coroner began, with a suave air of
suggesting an idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you must know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>Willie surprisingly burst out, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it was
the failure of a firm in London that owed us money that caused father
to hang himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the coroner. <div class="bookquote">``When did you hear of that failure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By second post on Friday. Eleven in the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we have heard enough, Mr. Coroner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Leal</b></font>)</div>said Leal, standing up in
the jury-box. <div class="bookquote">``We have decided on our verdict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>said the coroner, dismissing Willie. He (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) added,
in a tone of icy severity to the foreman: <div class="bookquote">``I had concluded my
examination of the witness.''  (<font color='red'><b>the foreman</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) wrote further in his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) book.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, gentlemen of the jury,''  (<font color='red'><b>the coroner</b></font>)</div>the coroner resumed, having first cleared
his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) throat; ``I think you will agree with me that this is a peculiarly
painful case. Yet at the same time--'

<p/>Anna hastened from the court as impulsively as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had entered it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
could think of nothing but the quiet, silent, pitiful corpse; and all
this vapid mouthing exasperated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) beyond sufferance.


<p/>On the Thursday afternoon, Anna was sitting alone in the house, with
the Persian cat and a pile of stockings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knee, darning. Agnes
had with sorrow returned to school; Ephraim was out. The bell sounded
violently, and Anna, thinking that perhaps for some reason her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father
had chosen to enter by the front door, ran to open it. The visitor was
Willie Price; he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) wore the new black suit which had figured in the
coroner's court. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) invited him (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) to the parlour and they both sat
down, tongue-tied. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had learnt from his (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) evidence given at
the inquest that Ephraim had not been pressing for rent during her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
absence in the Isle of Man, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt less like a criminal before Willie
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have felt without that assurance. But at the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was nervous, self-conscious, and shamed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had
called to make some arrangement with reference to the tenure of the
works, or, more probably, to announce a bankruptcy and stoppage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>Willie began, <div class="bookquote">``I've buried him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)'s gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div><p/>The simple and profound grief, and the restrained bitterness against
all the world, which were expressed in these words--the sole epitaph of
Titus Price--nearly made Anna cry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would have cried, if the cat
had not opportunely jumped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knee again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) controlled herself by
dint of stroking it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sympathised with him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) more intensely in that
first moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) loneliness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had ever sympathised with
anyone, even Agnes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished passionately to shield, shelter, and
comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>), to do something, however small, to diminish his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) sorrow and
humiliation; and this despite his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) size, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) ungainliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) coarse
features, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) rough voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) lack of all the conventional
refinements. A single look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) guileless and timid eyes atoned
for every shortcoming. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could scarcely open her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mouth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
knew not what to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no phrases to soften the frightful blow
which Providence had dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You must be relieved it's all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could have been Mrs. Sutton for half an hour! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was Anna,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feelings could only find outlet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) eyes. Happily young
Price was of those meek ones who know by instinct the language of the
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've come about the works, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is your father in? I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very
particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) isn't in now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) replied: `but he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) will be back by four o<div class="bookquote">``clock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's an hour. You don't know where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I must tell you, then.
I've come up to do it, and do it I must. I can't come up again;
neither can I wait. You remember that bill of exchange as we gave you
some weeks back towards rent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. There was a pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) stood up, and moved to the
mantelpiece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) gaze followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) intently, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had no idea what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) was about to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's forged, Miss Tellwright.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) sat down again, and seemed calmer,
braver, ready to meet any conceivable set of consequences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forged!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) repeated, not immediately grasping the significance of
the avowal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sutton's name is forged on it. So I came to tell your father; but
you'll do as well. I feel as if I should like to tell you all about
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) said, smiling sadly. ``Mr. Sutton had really given us a bill
for thirty pounds, but we'd paid that away when Mr. Tellwright sent
word down--you remember--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) should put bailiffs in if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) didn't
have twenty-five pounds next day. We were just turning the corner
then, father said to me. There was a goodish sum due to us from a
London firm in a month's time, and if we could only hold out till then,
father said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could see daylight for us. But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew as there'd be no
getting round Mr. Tellwright. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>) had the idea of using Mr. Sutton's
name--just temporary like. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) sent me to the post-office to buy a bill
stamp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) wrote out the bill all but the name. ``You take this up
to Tellwright's,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) says, ``and ask 'em to take it and hold it, and
we'll redeem it, and that'll be all right. No harm done there, Will!''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) says. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) tries Sutton's name on the back of an envelope. It's
an easy signature, as you know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) couldn't do it. ``Here, Will,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) says, ``my old hand shakes; you have a go,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) gives me a letter
of Sutton's to copy from. I did it easy enough after a try or two.
``That'll be all right, Will,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) says, and I put my hat on and brought
the bill up here. That's the truth, Miss Tellwright. It was the smash
of that London firm that finished my poor old father off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a culprit</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) one feeling was the sense of being herself a culprit. After all,
it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) father's action, more than anything else, that had led to
the suicide, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) agent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Price,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) said foolishly, `whatever shall you do?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``It was bound to be. It's
our luck. We'd no thought but what we should bring you thirty pound in
cash and get that bit of paper back, and rip it up, and no one the
worse. But we were always unlucky, me and him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>). All you've got to do
is just to tell your father, and say I'm ready to go to the
police-station when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gives the word. It's a bad business, but I'm
ready for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't we do something?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) naïvely inquired, with a vision of a trial
and sentence, and years of prison.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father keeps the bill, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? Not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to destroy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn``t,'' said Willie. ``You'll excuse me saying that, Miss
Tellwright, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn<div class="bookquote">``t.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) rose as if to go, bitterly. As for Anna, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father would never permit the bill to be destroyed. But at any cost
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) meant to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then, to ease his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lot, to send him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) away less
grievous than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, standing up, and abandoning the cat, <div class="bookquote">``I will see
what can be done. Yes. Something _shall_ be done--something or other.
I will come and see you at the works to-morrow afternoon. You may rely
on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw hope brighten his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes at the earnestness and resolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
tone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt richly rewarded. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never said another word, but
gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hand with such force that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) flinched in pain. When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived clearly the dire dilemma; but cared nothing, in
the first bliss of having reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>During tea it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) that as soon as Agnes had gone to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
would put the situation plainly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, and, for the first
and last time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life, assert herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that the
affair was, after all, entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would firmly demand
possession of the bill of exchange, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would insist on it being
destroyed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would point out to the old man that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) promise having
been given to Willie Price, no other course than this was possible. In
planning this night-surprise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's obstinacy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found
argument after argument auspicious of its success. The formidable
tyrant was at last to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) equal, in force, in resolution, and in
pugnacity. The swiftness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) onrush would sweep him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>), for once, off
his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) feet. At whatever cost, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was bound to win, even though victory
resulted in eternal enmity between father and daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) saw
herself towering over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), morally, with blazing eye and scornful
nostril. And, thus meditating on the grandeur of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) adventure, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
fed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) courage with indignation. By the act of death, Titus Price had
put her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father for ever in the wrong. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) corpse accused the miser,
and Anna, incapable now of seeing aught save the pathos of suicide,
acquiesced in the accusation with all the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remorse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
did not reason--she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt; reason was shrivelled up in the fire of
emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) almost trembled with the urgency of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) desire to protect
from further shame the figure of Willie Price, so frank, simple,
innocent, and big; and to protect also the lifeless and dishonoured
body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) parent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) reviewed the whole circumstances again and
again, each time finding less excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's implacable and
fatal cruelty.

<p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts ran until the appointed hour of Agnes's bedtime. It
was always necessary to remind Agnes of that hour; left to herself, the
child would have stayed up till the very Day of Judgment. The clock
struck, but Anna kept silence. To utter the word `bedtime' to Agnes
was to open the attack on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) felt as the conductor of
an opera feels before setting in motion a complicated activity which
may end in either triumph or an unspeakable fiasco. The child was
reading; Anna looked and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and at length her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips were set
for the phrase, <div class="bookquote">``Now Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>when, suddenly, the old man forestalled
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that wench going for sit here all night?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked of Anna,
menacingly.

<p/>Agnes shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) book and crept away.

<p/>This accident was the ruin of Anna's scheme. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, always the
favourite of circumstance, had by chance struck the first blow;
ignorant of the battle that awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had unwittingly won it by
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) in the wrong, as Titus Price had put him (<font color='blue'><b>Titus</b></font>) in the wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
knew in a flash that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) enterprise was hopeless; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's position in regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was impregnable, that no moral
force, no consciousness of right, would avail to overthrow that
authority which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had herself made absolute by a life-long
submission; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that face to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was, and
always would be, a coward. And now, instead of finding arguments for
success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) found arguments for failure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) divined all the retorts
that he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) would fling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). What about Mr. Sutton--in a sense the
victim of this fraud? It was not merely a matter of thirty pounds. A
man's name had been used. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Ephraim Tellwright, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Tellwright</b></font>)
daughter, to connive at a felony? The felony was done, and could not
be undone. Were they to render themselves liable, even in theory, to a
criminal prosecution? If Titus Price had killed himself, what of that?
If Willie Price was threatened with ruin, what of that? Them as made
the bed must lie on it. At the best, and apart from any forgery, the
Prices had swindled their creditors; even in dying, old Price had been
guilty of a commercial swindle. And was the fact that father and son
between them had committed a direct and flagrant crime to serve as an
excuse for sympathising with the survivor? Why was Anna so anxious to
shield the forger? What claim had he (<font color='blue'><b>forger</b></font>)? A forger was a forger, and that
was the end of it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to bed without opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) mouth. Irresolute, shamed, and
despairing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tried to pray for guidance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could bring no
sincerity of appeal into this prayer; it seemed an empty form. Where,
indeed, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) religion? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was obliged to acknowledge that the
fervour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aspirations had been steadily cooling for weeks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
was not a whit more a true Christian now than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had been before the
Revival; it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was incapable of real religion, possibly
one of those souls foreordained to damnation. This admission added to
the general sense of futility, and increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lay awake
for hours, confronting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) deliberate promise to Willie Price.
_Something shall be done_. _Rely on me_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was relying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), then.
But on whom could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rely? To whom could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) turn? It is significant
that the idea of confiding in Henry Mynors did not present itself for a
single moment as practical. Mynors had been kind to Willie in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
trouble, but Anna almost resented this kindness on account of the
condescending superiority which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) detected therein. It
was as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had overheard Mynors saying to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Here is this
poor, crushed worm. It is my duty as a Christian to pity and succour
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I will do so. I am a righteous man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>The thought of anyone
stooping to Willie was hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt equal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), as a
mother feels equal with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child when it cries and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soothes it.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt, in another way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was equal with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sturdy and simple confession, and of the loyal love in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) for hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hand, and for refusing to snatch at the slender chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's
clemency. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could never reveal Willie's sin, if it was a sin, to
Henry Mynors--that symbol of correctness and of success. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
fraternised with sinners, like Christ; and, with amazing injustice, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was capable of deeming Mynors a Pharisee because she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not find
fault with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) lived and loved so impeccably and so
triumphantly. There was only one person from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have asked
advice and help, and that wise and consoling heart was far away in the
Isle of Man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why won't father give up the bill?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) demanded, half aloud, in
sullen wrath. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not frame the answer in words, but
nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew it and felt it. Such an act of grace would have
been impossible to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father's nature--that was all.

<p/>Suddenly the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face changed from utter disgust into a
bitter and proud smile. Without thinking further, without daring to
think, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rose out of bed and, night-gowned and bare-footed, crept
with infinite precaution downstairs. The oilcloth on the stairs froze
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feet; a cold, grey light issuing through the glass square over the
front door showed that dawn was beginning. The door of the
front-parlour was shut; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) opened it gently, and went within. Every
object in the room was faintly visible, the bureau, the chair, the
files of papers, the pictures, the books on the mantelshelf, and the
safe in the corner. The bureau, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew, was never locked; fear of
their father had always kept its privacy inviolate from Anna and Agnes,
without the aid of a key. As Anna stood in front of it, a shaking
figure with hair hanging loose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dimly remembered having one day
seen a blue paper among white in the pigeon-holes. But if the bill was
not there she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) vowed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) would steal her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father's keys while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
slept, and force the safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) opened the bureau, and at once saw the
edge of a blue paper corresponding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) recollection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pulled
it forth and scanned it. <div class="bookquote">``Three months after date pay to our order ...
Accepted payable, _William Sutton_.''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie</b></font>)</div>So here was the forgery, here the
two words for which Willie Price might have gone to prison! What a
trifle! She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) tore the flimsy document to bits, and crumpled the bits
into a little ball. How should she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dispose of the ball? After a
moment's reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went into the kitchen, stretched on tiptoe to
reach the match-box from the high mantelpiece, struck a match, and
burnt the ball in the grate. Then, with a restrained and sinister
laugh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) ran softly upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter, Anna?''  (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div>Agnes was sitting up in bed, wide awake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing; go to sleep, and don't bother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna angrily whispered.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) closed the lid of the bureau? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was compelled to return in
order to make sure. Yes, it was closed. When at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lay in
bed, breathless, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart violently beating, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) feet like icicles,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) realised what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had saved Willie Price, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had ruined herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew well that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/>On the following afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) planned to hurry to Edward Street and
back while Ephraim and Agnes were both out of the house. But for some
reason her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father sat persistently after dinner, conning a sale
catalogue. At a quarter to three he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not moved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) decided to go
at any risks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hat and jacket, and opened the front
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called sharply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) obeyed the summons in terror. <div class="bookquote">``Art
going out?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Down town to buy some things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seems thou`rt always buying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) free. In an unworthy attempt to appease her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
conscience she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) did in fact go first into the town; she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) bought some
wool; the trick was despicable. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) hastened to Edward Street.
The decrepit works seemed to have undergone no change. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had
expected the business would be suspended, and Willie Price alone on the
bank; but manufacture was proceeding as usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) went direct to the
office, fancying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) climbed the stairs, that every window of all
the workshops was full of eyes to discern her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) purpose. Without
knocking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) pushed against the unlatched door and entered. Willie
was lolling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father's chair, gloomy, meditative, apparently idle.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was coatless, and wore a dirty apron; a battered hat was at the back
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) great hands which lay on the desk in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>),
were soiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sprang up, flushing red, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) shut the door; they
were alone together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm all in my dirt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) murmured apologetically. Simple and silly
creature, to imagine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) dirt!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) said; `you needn't worry any more. It's all
right.'' They were glorious words for her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) face shone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) asked gruffly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) smiled, full of happiness, <div class="bookquote">``I got that paper and burnt it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) exactly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had not understood. <div class="bookquote">``Does your
father know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) still smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) happily. <div class="bookquote">``No; but I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) this
afternoon. It's all right. I've burnt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sank down in the chair, and, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) head on the desk, burst into
sobbing tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), and put a hand on the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
shirt. At that touch he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) sobbed more violently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Price, what is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) asked the question in a calm, soothing
tone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) glanced up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) face wet, yet apparently not shamed by the
tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) could not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) gaze without herself crying, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I was only thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) stammered, `only
thinking--what an angel you are.''

<p/>Only the meek, the timid, the silent, can, in moments of deep feeling,
use this language of hyperbole without seeming ridiculous.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) great child, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>). Oh,
ineffable power, that out of misfortune canst create divine happiness!

<p/>Later, he (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) remarked in his (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) ordinary tone: <div class="bookquote">``I was expecting your father
here this afternoon about the lease. There is to be a deed of
arrangement with the creditors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) exclaimed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>meek</b></font>) good-bye.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) passed under the archway she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) heard a familiar voice: <div class="bookquote">``I reckon I
shall find young Mester Price in th' office?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Ephraim, who had
wandered into the packing-house, turned and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) through the
doorway; a second's delay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) would have escaped. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) stood
waiting the storm, and then they walked out into the road together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, what art doing here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) did not know what to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What art doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) repeated coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I--was just going back home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) hesitated an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I'll go with thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) said. They walked
back to Manor Terrace in silence. They had tea in silence; except that
Agnes, with dreadful inopportuneness, continually worried her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father
for a definite promise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) might leave school at Christmas. The
idea was preposterous; but Agnes, fired by her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) recent success as a
housekeeper, clung to it. Ignorant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) imminent danger, and
misinterpreting the signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) at last pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
insistence too far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get to bed, this minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, in a voice suddenly terrible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>)
perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) error then, but it was too late. Looking wistfully at
Anna, the child fled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was told this morning, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Ephraim began, as soon as Agnes was
gone, `that young Price had bin seen coming to this house `ere
yesterday afternoon. I thought as it was strange as thoud`st said nowt
about it to thy feyther; but I never suspected as a daughter o' mine
was up to any tricks. There was a hang-dog look on thy face this
afternoon when I asked where thou wast going, but I didna' think thou
wast lying to me.''

<p/>``I wasn<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began, and stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wast! Now, what is it? What's this carrying-on between thee and
Will Price? I'll have it out of thee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no carrying-on, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why hast thou gotten secrets? Why dost go sneaking about to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--sneaking, creeping, like any brazen moll?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The miser</b></font>)</div><p/>The miser was wounded in the one spot where there remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) any
sentiment capable of being wounded: his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) faith in the irreproachable,
absolute chastity, in thought and deed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) womankind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Willie Price came in here yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna began, white and calm, `to
see you. But you weren't in. So he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) saw me. He (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) told me that bill of
exchange, that blue paper, for thirty pounds, was forged. He (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)
had forged Mr. Sutton's name on it.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stopped, expecting the
thunder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get on with thy tale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>said Ephraim, breathing loudly.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was ready to go to prison as soon as you gave the word.
But I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``No such thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>I said it must be settled quietly. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) to leave it to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) was driven to the forgery, and I
thought--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dost mean to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the miser shouted, `as that blasted scoundrel came
here and told thee he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)'d forged a bill, and thou told him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to leave it to
thee to settle?'' Without waiting for an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) jumped up and
strode to the door, evidently with the intention of examining the
forged document for himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't there--it isn't there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna called to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) wildly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What isna' there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The paper. I may as well tell you, father. I got up early this
morning and burnt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man was staggered at this audacious and astounding impiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was mine, really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) continued; `and I thought--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou thought!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Agnes, upstairs, heard that passionate and consuming roar. ``Shame on
thee, Anna Tellwright! Shame on thee for a shameless hussy! A
daughter o' mine, and just promised to another man! Thou`rt an
accomplice in forgery. Thou sees the scamp on the sly! Thou--' He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>)
paused, and then added, with furious scorn: <div class="bookquote">``Shalt speak o' this to
Henry Mynors?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) said proudly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look thee here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hissed, `if thou breathes a word o' this to Henry
Mynors, or any other man, I'll cut thy tongue out. A daughter o' mine!
If thou breathes a word--'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was finished; grey with frightful anger, Ephraim left the room.




<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>AT THE PRIORY

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not to be pardoned: the offence was too monstrous, daring, and
final. At the same time, the unappeasable ire of the old man tended to
weaken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). All her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been terrorised by the
fear of a wrath which had never reached the superlative degree until
that day. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had seen and felt the limit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
became aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could endure it; the curse was heavy, and perhaps
more irksome than heavy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) survived; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued to breathe,
eat, drink, and sleep; her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's power stopped short of
annihilation. Here, too, was a satisfaction: that things could not be
worse. And still greater comfort lay in the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not only
accomplished the deliverance of Willie Price, but had secured absolute
secrecy concerning the episode.

<p/>The next day was Saturday, when, after breakfast, it was Ephraim's
custom to give Anna the weekly sovereign for housekeeping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) said, turning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) armchair to face the child, and
drawing a sovereign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, `take charge o' this,
and mind ye make it go as far as ye can.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) tone conveyed a
subsidiary message: <div class="bookquote">``I am terribly angry, but I am not angry with you.
However, behave yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div><p/>The child mechanically took the coin, scared by this proof of an
unprecedented domestic convulsion. Anna, with a tightening of the
lips, rose and went into the kitchen. Agnes followed, after a discreet
interval, and in silence gave up the sovereign.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it all about, Anna?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) ventured to ask that night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna curtly.

<p/>The question had needed some courage, for, at certain times, Agnes
would as easily have trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father as with Anna. From that
moment, with the passive fatalism characteristic of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) years, Agnes'
spirits began to rise again to the normal level. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) accepted the new
situation, and fitted herself into it with a child's adaptability. If
Anna naturally felt a slight resentment against this too impartial and
apparently callous attitude on the part of the child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) never showed
it.

<p/>Nearly a week later, Anna received a postcard from Beatrice announcing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) complete recovery, and the immediate return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) parents and
herself to Bursley. That same afternoon, a cab encumbered with much
luggage passed up the street as Anna was fixing clean curtains in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father's bedroom. Beatrice, on the look-out, waved a hand and smiled,
and Anna responded to the signals. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was glad now that the Suttons
had come back, though for several days she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had almost forgotten their
existence. On the Saturday afternoon, Mynors called. Anna was in the
kitchen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) scuffling with Agnes in the lobby, and then
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father. Three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
disgrace, and each time the secret bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) soul, despite
conscientious effort to repress it, had marred the meeting--it had been
plain, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was profoundly disturbed; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had affected at
first not to observe the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), anticipating his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
questions, hinted briefly that the trouble was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, and had
no reference to himself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) preferred not to discuss it at
all; reassured, and too young in courtship yet to presume on a lover's
rights, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wish, and endeavoured by every art to restore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to equanimity. This time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went to greet him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in the parlour,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) resolved that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should see no more of the shadow. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) noticed
instantly the difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've come to take you into Sutton's for tea--and for the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
said eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``You must come. They are very anxious to see you. I've
told your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) added. Ephraim had vanished into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) office.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say, Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said you must please yourself, of course. Come along, love.
Mustn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), Agnes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>Agnes concurred, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) would get her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) father's tea, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
supper too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) urged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) nodded, smiling thoughtfully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), for the first time in front of Agnes, who was filled with
pride at this proof of their confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm ready, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said, a quarter of an hour later, and they
went across to Sutton's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Anna, tell me all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice burst out when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) and Anna had
fled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) bedroom. <div class="bookquote">``I'm so glad. Do you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) really--truly?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)'s dreadfully fond of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told me so this morning; we had quite
a long chat in the market. I think you're both very lucky, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kissed Anna effusively for the third time. Anna looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
smiling but silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want me to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh! You are the funniest girl, Anna, I ever met. ``What do you want
me to say,<div class="bookquote">'' indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Beatrice added in a different tone: <div class="bookquote">``Don't
imagine this affair was the least bit of a surprise to us. It wasn't.
The fact is, Henry had--oh! well, never mind. Do you know, mother and
dad used to think there was something between Henry and me. But there
wasn't, you know--not really. I tell you that, so that you won't be
able to say you were kept in the dark. When shall you be married,
Anna?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna replied, and began to question
Beatrice about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) convalescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm perfectly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice said. <div class="bookquote">``It's always the same. If I
catch anything I catch it bad and get it over quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, how long are you two chatterboxes going to stay here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>It was
Mrs. Sutton who came into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Bee, you've got those
sewing-meeting letters to write. Eh, Anna, but I'm glad of this.
You'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a good wife. You two'll just suit each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna could not but be impressed by this unaffected joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) friends
in the engagement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) spirits rose, and once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw visions of
future happiness. At tea, Alderman Sutton added his (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) felicitations to
the rest, with that flattering air of intimate sympathy and
comprehension which some middle-aged men can adopt towards young girls.
The tea, made specially magnificent in honour of the betrothal, was
such a meal as could only have been compassed in Staffordshire or
Yorkshire--a high tea of the last richness and excellence, exquisitely
gracious to the palate, but ruthless in its demands on the stomach. At
one end of the table, which glittered with silver, glass, and Longshaw
china, was a fowl which had been boiled for four hours; at the other, a
hot pork-pie, islanded in liquor, which might have satisfied a
regiment. Between these two dishes were all the delicacies which
differentiate high tea from tea, and on the quality of which the
success of the meal really depends; hot pikelets, hot crumpets, hot
toast, sardines with tomatoes, raisin-bread, current-bread, seed-cake,
lettuce, home-made marmalade and home-made jams. The repast occupied
over an hour, and even then not a quarter of the food was consumed.
Surrounded by all that good fare and good-will, with the Alderman on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) left, Henry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) right, and a bright fire in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>), Anna
quickly caught the gaiety of the others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) forgot everything but the
gladness of reunion, the joy of the moment, the luxurious comfort of
the house. Conversation was busy with the doings of the Suttons at
Port Erin after Anna and Henry had left. A listener would have caught
fragments like this:--``You know such-and-such a point... No, not
there, over the hill. Well, we hired a carriage and drove... The
weather was simply... Tom Kelly said he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>)'d never... And that little
guard on the railway came all the way down to the steamer... Did you
see anything in the ``Signal<div class="bookquote">'' about the actress being drowned? Oh! It
was awfully sad. We saw the corpse just after... Beatrice, will you
hush?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't it terrible about Titus Price?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, my!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Sutton, glancing at Anna. <div class="bookquote">``You can never tell
what's going to happen next. I'm always afraid to go away for fear of
something happening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A silence followed. When tea was finished Beatrice was taken away by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother to write the letters concerning the immediate resumption of
sewing-meetings, and for a little time Anna was left in the
drawing-room alone with the two men, who began to talk about the
affairs of the Prices. It appeared that Mr. Sutton had been asked to
become trustee for the creditors under a deed of arrangement, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) had hopes of being able to sell the business as a going concern. In
the meantime it would need careful management.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will Willie Price manage it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna inquired. The question seemed to
divert Henry and the Alderman, to afford them a contemptuous and
somewhat inimical amusement at the expense of Willie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alderman/Alderman Sutton</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman, quietly, but emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Master William is fairly good on the works,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Henry; `but in the
office, I imagine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is worse than useless.''

<p/>Grieved and confused, Anna bent down and moved a hassock in order to
hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face. The attitude of these men to Willie Price, that victim
of circumstances and of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) own simplicity, wounded Anna inexpressibly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) perceived that they could see in him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) only a defaulting debtor, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) misfortune made no appeal to their charity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wondered that men
so warm-hearted and kind in some relations could be so hard in others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a talk with your father at the creditors' meeting yesterday,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alderman/Alderman Sutton</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman. <div class="bookquote">``You won't lose much. Of course you've got a
preferential claim for six months' rent.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) said this reassuringly,
as though it would give satisfaction. Anna did not know what a
preferential claim might be, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) aware of any creditors'
meeting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wished ardently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might lose as much as
possible--hundreds of pounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was relieved when Beatrice swept in,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother following.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, your worship,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) father, `seven stamps for
these letters, please.'' Anna glanced up inquiringly on hearing the
form of address. ``You don't mean to say that you didn't know that
father is going to be mayor this year?'' Beatrice asked, as if shocked
at this ignorance of affairs. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was all settled rather late,
wasn't it, dad? And the mayor-elect pretends not to care much, but
actually he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor-elect</b></font>) is filled with pride, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor-elect</b></font>), dad? As for the
mayoress--?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, Bee!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), smiling; `you'll tumble over that
tongue of yours some day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother said I wasn't to mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, `lest you should
think we were putting on airs.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, not I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sutton protested. <div class="bookquote">``I said no such thing. Anna
knows us too well for that. But I'm not so set up with this mayor
business as some people will think I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or as Beatrice is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors added.

<p/>At half-past eight, and again at nine, Anna said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) must go home;
but the Suttons, now frankly absorbed in the topic of the mayoralty,
their secret preoccupation, would not spoil the confidential talk which
had ensued by letting the lovers depart. It was nearly half-past nine
before Anna and Henry stood on the pavement outside, and Beatrice,
after facetious farewells, had shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us just walk round by the Manor Farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``It won't
take more than a quarter of an hour or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) agreed dutifully. The footpath ran at right angles to Trafalgar
Road, past a colliery whose engine-fires glowed in the dark, moonless,
autumn night, and then across a field. They stood on a knoll near the
old farmstead, that extraordinary and pathetic survival of a vanished
agriculture. Immediately in front of them stretched acres of burning
ironstone--a vast tremulous carpet of flame woven in red, purple, and
strange greens. Beyond were the skeleton-like silhouettes of
pit-heads, and the solid forms of furnace and chimney-shaft. In the
distance a canal reflected the gigantic illuminations of Cauldon Bar
Ironworks. It was a scene mysterious and romantic enough to kindle the
raptures of love, but Anna felt cold, melancholy, and apprehensive of
vague sorrows. <div class="bookquote">``Why am I so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) asked herself, and tried in vain to
shake off the mood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will Willie Price do if the business is sold?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) questioned
Mynors suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), `you aren't still worrying about that
misfortune. I wish you had never gone near the inquest; the thing
seems to have got on your mind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) protested, with an air of cheerfulness. <div class="bookquote">``But I was just
wondering.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Willie will have to do the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) can. Get a place somewhere,
I suppose. It won't be much, at the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) guessed what perhaps hung on that answer, Mynors might have
given it in a tone less callous and perfunctory. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) have seen
the tightening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) might even afterwards have repaired his (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
error by some voluntary assurance that Willie Price should be watched
over with a benevolent eye and protected with a strong arm. But how
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to know that in misprizing Willie Price before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was
misprizing a child to its mother? He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had done something for Willie
Price, and considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had done enough. His (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) thoughts, moreover,
were on other matters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember that day we went up to the park?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) murmured fondly;
`that Sunday? I have never told you that that evening I came out of
chapel after the first hymn, when I noticed you weren't there, and
walked up past your house. I couldn't help it. Something drew me. I
nearly called in to see you. Then I thought I had better not.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said calmly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) warmth made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feel sad. <div class="bookquote">``I saw
you stop at the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did? But you weren't at the window?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw you through the glass of the front-door.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice grew
fainter, more reluctant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you were watching?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In the dark he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with such
violence, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so vehemently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was startled out of
herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Henry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) entreated, his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) arm still round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waist; <div class="bookquote">``I want
you to call me Harry. No one else does or ever has done, and no one
shall, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said deliberately, bracing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind to a positive
determination. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must please him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said it again: <div class="bookquote">``Harry;
yes, it has a nice sound.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Ephraim sat reading the ``Signal' in the parlour when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arrived home
at five minutes to ten. Imbued then with ideas of duty, submission,
and systematic kindliness, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had an impulse to attempt a
reconciliation with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I've not kept you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) was deaf.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to bed resigned; sad, but not gloomy. It was not for nothing
that during all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been accustomed to infelicity.
Experience had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) this: to be the mistress of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could face any fact--even the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dispassionate
frigidity under Mynors' caresses. It was on the firm, almost rapturous
resolve to succour Willie Price, if need be, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fell asleep.

<p/>The engagement, which had hitherto been kept private, became the theme
of universal gossip immediately upon the return of the Suttons from the
Isle of Man. Two words let fall by Beatrice in the St. Luke's covered
market on Saturday morning had increased and multiplied till the whole
town echoed with the news. Anna's private fortune rose as high as a
quarter of a million. As for Henry Mynors, it was said that Henry
Mynors knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was about. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was like the rest.
Money, money! Of course it was inconceivable that a fine, prosperous
figure of a man, such as Mynors, would have made up to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)_, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
had not been simply rolling in money. Well, there was one thing to be
said for young Mynors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would put money to good use; you might rely
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would not hoard it up same as it had been hoarded up. However, the
more saved, the more for young Mynors, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) needn't grumble. It was
to be hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) dress herself a bit better--though indeed
it hadn't been her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) fault she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) went about so shabby; the old skinflint
would never allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a penny of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own. So tongues wagged.

<p/>The first Sunday was a tiresome ordeal for Anna, both at school and at
chapel. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I never!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>seemed to be written like a note of
exclamation on every brow; the monotony of the congratulations fatigued
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) involuntary efforts to grasp what each speaker had
left unsaid of innuendo, malice, envy or sycophancy. Even the people
in the shops, during the next few days, could not serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) without
direct and curious reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) private affairs. The general
opinion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was a cold and bloodless creature was strengthened by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) attitude at this period. But the apathy which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) displayed was
neither affected nor due to an excessive diffidence. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) seemed, so
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) often wondered what would have happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) if that
vague `something' between Henry and Beatrice, to which Beatrice had
confessed, had ever taken definite shape.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hancock came back from Lancashire last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
arrived at Manor Terrace on the next Saturday afternoon. Ephraim was
in the room, and Henry, evidently joyous and triumphant, addressed both
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and Anna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Hancock the commercial traveller?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) knew that
Hancock was the commercial traveller, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) experienced a nervous
compulsion to make idle remarks in order to hide the breach of
intercourse between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father and herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)'s had a magnificent journey.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>asked the miser.

<p/>Henry named the amount of orders taken in a fortnight's journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the miser ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``That's better than a bat in the eye
with a burnt stick.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>From him (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>), this was the superlative of praise.
<div class="bookquote">``You're making good money at any rate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That reminds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Ephraim remarked gruffly. <div class="bookquote">``When dost think o'
getting wed? I'm not much for long engagements, and so I tell ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
threw a cold glance sideways at Anna. The idea penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) heart
like a stab: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hancock</b></font>) wants to get me out of the house!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors, surprised at the question and the tone, and,
looking at Anna as if for an explanation: <div class="bookquote">``I had scarcely thought of
that. What does Anna say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) murmured; and then, more bravely, in a louder
voice, and with a smile: <div class="bookquote">``The sooner the better.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
bitter and painful resentment: <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Hancock</b></font>) wants me to go, go I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry tactfully passed on to another phase of the subject: <div class="bookquote">``I met Mr.
Sutton yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) was telling me of Price's house up at Toft
End. It belonged to Mr. Price, but of course it was mortgaged up to
the hilt. The mortgagees have taken possession, and Mr. Sutton said it
would be to let cheap at Christmas. Of course Willie and old Sarah
Vodrey, the housekeeper, will clear out. I was thinking it might do
for us. It's not a bad sort of house, or, rather, it won't be when
it's repaired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will they ask for it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ephraim/Ephraim Tellwright/Tellwright</b></font>)</div>Ephraim inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-five or twenty-eight. It's a nice large house--four bedrooms,
and a very good garden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Four bedrooms!''  (<font color='red'><b>the miser</b></font>)</div>the miser exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What dost want wi' four
bedrooms? You'd have for keep a servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Naturally we should keep a servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors said, with calm politeness.

<p/>``You could get one o' them new houses up by th' park for fifteen pounds
as would do you well enough'; the miser protested against these dreams
of extravagance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that part of the town,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. <div class="bookquote">``It's too new
for my taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>After tea, when Henry and Anna went out for the Saturday evening
stroll, Mynors suddenly suggested: ``Why not go up and look through that
house of Price<div class="bookquote">``s?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't it seem like turning them out if we happen to take it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turning them out! Willie is bound to leave it. What use is it to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)? Besides, it's in the hands of the mortgagees now. Why shouldn't
we take it just as well as anybody else, if it suits us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>Anna had no reply, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) surrendered herself placidly enough to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
will; nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could not entirely banish a misgiving that
Willie Price was again to be victimised. Infinitely more disturbing
than this illogical sensation, however, was the instinctive and sure
knowledge, revealed in a flash, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father wished to be rid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). So implacable, then, was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) animosity against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)! Never, never
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) been so deeply hurt. The wound, in fact, was so severe that at
first she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) felt only a numbness that reduced everything to unimportance,
robbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) of volition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) walked up to Toft End as if walking in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sleep.

<p/>Price's house, sometimes called Priory House, in accordance with a
legend that a priory had once occupied the site, stood in the middle of
the mean and struggling suburb of Toft End, which was flung up the
hillside like a ragged scarf. Built of red brick, towards the end of
the eighteenth century, double-fronted, with small, evenly disposed
windows, and a chimney stack at either side, it looked westward over
the town smoke towards a horizon of hills. It had a long, narrow
garden, which ran parallel with the road. Behind it, adjoining, was a
small, disused potworks, already advanced in decay. On the north side,
and enclosed by a brick wall which surrounded also the garden, was a
small orchard of sterile and withered fruit trees. In parts the wall
had crumpled under the assaults of generations of boys, and from the
orchard, through the gaps, could be seen an expanse of grey-green
field, with a few abandoned pit-shafts scattered over it. These
shafts, imperfectly protected by ruinous masonry, presented an
appearance strangely sinister and forlorn, raising visions in the mind
of dark and mysterious depths peopled with miserable ghosts of those
who had toiled there in the days when to be a miner was to be a slave.
The whole place, house and garden, looked ashamed and sad, with a
shabby mournfulness acquired gradually from its inmates during many
years. But, nevertheless, the house was substantial, and the air on
that height fresh and pure.

<p/>Mynors rang in vain at the front door, and then they walked round the
house to the orchard, and discovered Sarah Vodrey taking in clothes
from a line--a diminutive and wasted figure, with scanty, grey hair, a
tiny face permanently soured, and bony hands contorted by rheumatism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My rheumatism's that bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) said in response to greetings, <div class="bookquote">``I can
scarce move about, and this house is a regular barracks to keep clean.
No; Willie's not in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)'s at th' works, as usual--Saturday like any
other day. I'm by myself here all day and every day. But I reckon
us'n be flitting soon, and me lived here eight-and-twenty year! Praise
God, there's a mansion up there for me at last. And not sorry shall I
be when He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) calls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very lonely for you, Miss Vodrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) knew
exactly how to speak to this dame who lived her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) life like a fly between
two panes of glass, and who could find room in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) head for only three
ideas, namely: that God and herself were on terms of intimacy; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>)
was, and had always been, indispensable to the Price family; and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) social status was far above that of a servant. <div class="bookquote">``It's a pity you
never married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Mynors added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me, marry! What would _they_ ha' done without me? No, I'm none for
marriage and never was. I'd be shamed to be like some o' them
spinsters down at chapel, always hanging round chapel-yard on the
off-chance of a service, to catch that there young Mr. Sargent, the new
minister. It's a sign of a hard winter, Miss Terrick, when the hay
runs after the horse, that's what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Tellwright and myself are in search of a house,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Mynors gently
interrupted the flow, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) a peculiar glance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>)
appreciated. <div class="bookquote">``We heard you and Willie were going to leave here, and so
we came up just to look over the place, if it's quite convenient to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, I understand ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) said; `come in. But ye mun tak' things as
ye find 'em, Miss Terrick.''

<p/>Dismal and unkempt, the interior of the house matched the exterior.
The carpets were threadbare, the discoloured wall-papers hung loose on
the walls, the ceilings were almost black, the paint had nearly been
rubbed away from the woodwork; the exhausted furniture looked as if it
would fall to pieces in despair if compelled to face the threatened
ordeal of an auction-sale. But to Anna the rooms were surprisingly
large, and there seemed so many of them! It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) were
exploring an immense abode, like a castle, with odd chambers
continually showing themselves in unexpected places. The upper story
was even less inviting than the ground-floor--barer, more chill,
utterly comfortless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is the best bedroom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Vodrey</b></font>)</div>said Miss Vodrey. <div class="bookquote">``And a rare big room
too! It's not used now. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)_ slept here. Willie sleeps at back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very nice room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mynors agreed blandly, and measured it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had
done all the others, with a two-foot, entering the figures in his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>)
pocket-book.

<p/>Anna's eye wandered uneasily across the room, with its dismantled bed
and decrepit mahogany suite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hanged himself at the works, and not here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thought.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked out at the window. <div class="bookquote">``What a splendid view!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
remarked to Mynors.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had taken a fancy to the house. The sagacious fellow
esteemed it, not as it was, but as it would be, re-papered, re-painted,
re-furnished, the outer walls pointed, the garden stocked; everything
cleansed, brightened, renewed. And there was indeed much to be said
for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fancy. The house was large, with plenty of ground; the
boundary wall secured that privacy which young husbands and young wives
instinctively demand; the outlook was unlimited, the air the purest in
the Five Towns. And the rent was low, because the great majority of
those who could afford such a house would never deign to exist in a
quarter so poverty-stricken and unfashionable.

<p/>After leaving the house they continued their walk up the hill, and then
turned off to the left on the high road from Hanbridge to Moorthorne.
The venerable but not dignified town lay below them, a huddled medley
of brown brick under a thick black cloud of smoke. The gold angel of
the town-hall gleamed in the evening light, and the dark, squat tower
of the parish church, sole relic of the past stood out grim and
obdurate amid the featureless buildings which surrounded it. To the
north and east miles of moorland, defaced by collieries and murky
hamlets, ran to the horizon. Across the great field at their feet a
figure slouched along, past the abandoned pit-shafts. They both
recognised the man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Willie Price going home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) looks tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was relieved that they had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
at the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Mynors began earnestly, after a pause, `why shouldn't we get
married soon, since the old gentleman seems rather to expect it? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s
been rather awkward lately, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''

<p/>This was the only reference made by Mynors to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) father's temper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
nodded. <div class="bookquote">``How soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was just thinking. Suppose, for the sake of argument, this
house turns out all right. I couldn't get it thoroughly done up much
before the middle of January--couldn't begin till these people had
moved. Suppose we said early in February?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Could you be ready by that time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I could be ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, why shouldn't we fix February, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's the question of Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and there will always be the question of Agnes. Your father will
have to get a housekeeper. You and I will be able to see after little
Agnes, never fear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, with tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
on that point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not February?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) reflected. <div class="bookquote">``Why not to-morrow, as father wants
me out of the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was agreed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've taken the Priory, subject to your approval,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>Henry said, less
than a fortnight later. From that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) invariably referred to the
place as the Priory.


<p/>It was on the very night after this eager announcement that the
approaching tragedy came one step nearer. Beatrice, in a modest
evening-dress, with a white cloak--excited, hurried, and important--ran
in to speak to Anna. The carriage was waiting outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
father and mother had to attend a very important dinner at the mayor's
house at Hillport, in connection with Mr. Sutton's impending mayoralty.
Old Sarah Vodrey had just sent down a girl to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) was unwell,
and would be grateful if Mrs. Sutton or Beatrice would visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>). It
was a most unreasonable time for such a summons, but Sarah was a
fidgety old crotchet, and knew how frightfully good-natured Mrs. Sutton
was. Would Anna mind going up to Toft End? And would Anna come out to
the carriage and personally assure Mrs. Sutton that old Sarah should be
attended to? If not, Beatrice was afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) mother would take it into
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head to do something stupid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very good of you, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton, when Anna went outside
with Beatrice. <div class="bookquote">``But I think I'd better go myself. The poor old thing
may feel slighted if I don't, and Beatrice can well take my place at
this affair at Hillport, which I've no mind for.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was already half
out of the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna firmly, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be
delighted to go and do what I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right, Anna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div>said the Alderman from the darkness of the
carriage, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Alderman</b></font>) shirt-front gleamed; <div class="bookquote">``Bee said you'd go, and we're
much obliged to ye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Alderman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect it will be nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, as the vehicle drove off;
<div class="bookquote">``Sarah has served mother this trick before now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div><p/>As Anna opened the garden-gate of the Priory she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) discerned a figure
amid the rank bushes, which had been allowed to grow till they almost
met across the narrow path leading to the front door of the house.

<p/>It was a thick and mysterious night--such a night as death chooses; and
Anna jumped in vague terror at the apparition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Vodrey sent down to ask Mrs. Sutton to
come up and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>), but Mrs. Sutton had an engagement, so I came
instead.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The figure moved forward; it was Willie Price.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) peered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could see the mortal pallor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) exclaimed, `it's Miss Tellwright, is it? Will ye come in,
Miss Tellwright?''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) with beating heart, alarmed, apprehensive. The front
door stood wide open, and at the far end of the gloomy passage a faint
light shone from the open door of the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">``This way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said.
In the large, bare, stone-floored kitchen Sarah Vodrey sat limp and
with closed eyes in an old rocking-chair close to the fireless range.
The window, which gave on to the street, was open; through that window
Sarah, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) extremity, had called the child who ran down to Mrs.
Sutton's. On the deal table were a dirty cup and saucer, a tea-pot,
bread, butter, and a lighted candle--sole illumination of the chamber.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I come home, and I find this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said.

<p/>Daunted for a moment by the scene of misery, Anna could say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) repeated, as if accusing God of spitefulness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
lifted the candle to show the apparently insensible form of the woman.
Sarah's wrinkled and seamed face had the flush of fever, and the
features were drawn into the expression of a terrible anxiety; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
hands hung loose; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) breathed like a dog after a run.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) to have the doctor yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said, `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
wouldn't. Ever since you and Mr. Mynors called she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'s been cleaning the
house down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said you'd happen be coming again soon, and the place
wasn't fit to be seen. No use me arguing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better run for a doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just going off when you came. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>)'s been complaining more of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) rheumatism, and pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) hips, lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go now; fetch Mr. Macpherson, and call at our house and say I shall
stay here all night. Wait a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was exhausted
from lack of food, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cut a thick piece of bread-and-butter. <div class="bookquote">``Eat
this as you go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't eat; it'll choke me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it choke you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You've got to swallow it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Child of a hundred sorrows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) must be treated as a child. As soon as
Willie was gone she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hat and jacket, and lit a lamp; there
was no gas in the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that light?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the old woman asked peevishly, rousing herself and
sitting up. <div class="bookquote">``I doubt I'll be late with Willie's tea. Eh, Miss
Terrick, what's amiss?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're not quite well, Miss Vodrey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna answered. <div class="bookquote">``If you'll show
me your room, I'll see you into bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Without giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) a moment for
hesitation, Anna seized the feeble creature under the arms, and so,
coaxing, supporting, carrying, got her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) to bed. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) lay on
the narrow mattress, panting, exhausted. It was Sarah's final effort.

<p/>Anna lit fires in the kitchen and in the bedroom, and when Willie
returned with Dr. Macpherson, water was boiling and tea made.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better get a woman in,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor curtly, in the kitchen,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) examination of Sarah. <div class="bookquote">``Some neighbour for
to-night, and I'll send a nurse up from the cottage-hospital early
to-morrow morning. Not that it will be the least use. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) must have
been dying for the last two days at least. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'s got pericarditis and
pleurisy. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'s breathing I don't know how many to the minute, and her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
temperature is just about as high as it can be. It all follows from
rheumatism, and then taking cold. Gross carelessness and neglect all
through! I've no patience with such work.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turned angrily to
Willie. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what on earth you were thinking of, Mr. Price,
not to send for me earlier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div><p/>Willie, abashed and guilty, found nothing to say. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) eye had the meek
wistfulness of Holman Hunt's <div class="bookquote">``Scapegoat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Holman Hunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Price wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to have the doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, defending him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
with warmth; `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) wouldn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) is out at the works all day till
late at night. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was? She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) could walk about.''

<p/>The tall doctor glanced at Anna in surprise, and at once modified his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
tone. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, `that's the curious thing. It passes me how she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
managed to get about. But there is no knowing what an obstinate woman
won't force herself to do. I'll send the medicine up to-night, and
come along myself with the nurse early to-morrow. Meantime, keep
carefully to my instructions.''

<p/>That night remains for ever fixed in Anna's memory: the grim rooms,
echoing and shadowy; the countless journeys up and down dark stairs and
passages; Willie sitting always immovable in the kitchen, idle because
there was nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to do; Sarah incessantly panting on the
truckle-bed; the hired woman from up the street, buxom, kindly, useful,
but fatuous in the endless monotony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) commiserations.

<p/>Towards morning, Sarah Vodrey gave sign of a desire to talk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've fought the fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) murmured to Anna, who alone was in the
bedroom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I've fought the fight; I've kept the faith. In that
box there ye'll see a purse. There's seventeen pounds six in it. That
will pay for the funeral, and Willie must have what's over. There
would ha' been more for the lad, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) never paid me no wages this two
years past. I never troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell Willie that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna said impetuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh, bless ye, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>the drudge</b></font>)</div>said the dying drudge, and then seemed to doze.

<p/>Anna went to the kitchen, and sent the woman upstairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Willie/Willie Price</b></font>)</div>asked Willie, without stirring. Anna shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) head.
<div class="bookquote">``Neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) nor me will be here much longer, I'm thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said,
smiling wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) exclaimed, startled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Sutton has arranged to sell our business as a going-concern--some
people at Turnhill are buying it. I shall go to Australia; there's no
room for me here. The creditors have promised to allow me twenty-five
pounds, and I can get an assisted passage. Bursley'll know me no more.
But--but--I shall always remember you and what you've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) longed to kneel at his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) feet, and to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>), and to cry: <div class="bookquote">``It is
I who have ruined you--driven your father to cheating his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) servant, to
crime, to suicide; driven you to forgery, and turned you out of your
house which your old servant killed herself in making clean for me. I
have wronged you, and I love you like a mother because I have wronged
you and because I saved you from prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said nothing except: <div class="bookquote">``Some of us will miss you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Sarah Vodrey died--she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) who had never lived save in the
fetters of slavery and fanaticism. After fifty years of ceaseless
labour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) had gained the affection of one person, and enough money to
pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vodrey</b></font>) own funeral. Willie Price took a cheap lodging with the
woman who had been called in on the night of Sarah's collapse. Before
Christmas he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was to sail for Melbourne. The Priory, deserted, gave up
its rickety furniture to a van from Hanbridge, where, in an
auction-room, the frail sticks lost their identity in a medley of other
sticks, and ceased to be. Then the bricklayer, the plasterer, the
painter, and the paper-hanger came to the Priory, and whistled and sang
in it.




<p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>THE BAZAAR

<p/>The Wesleyan Bazaar, the greatest undertaking of its kind ever known in
Bursley, gradually became a cloud which filled the entire social
horizon. Mrs. Sutton, organiser of the Sunday-school stall, pressed
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) friends into the service, and a fortnight after the death of
Sarah Vodrey, Anna and even Agnes gave much of their spare time to the
work, which was carried on under pressure increasing daily as the final
moments approached. This was well for Anna, in that it diverted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
thoughts by keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) energies fully engaged. One morning, however,
it occurred to Mrs. Sutton to reflect that Anna, at such a period of
life, should be otherwise employed. Anna had called at the Suttons' to
deliver some finished garments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you for all this
industry. But I've been thinking that as you are to be married in
February you ought to be preparing your things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna repeated idly; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) remembered Mynors'
phrase, on the hill, <div class="bookquote">``Can you be ready by that time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton; `but possibly you've been getting forward with
them on the quiet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna, with an air of interest; <div class="bookquote">``I've meant to ask you
before: Is it the bride's place to provide all the house-linen, and
that sort of thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/>``It was in my day; but those things alter so. The bride took all the
house-linen to her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband, and as many clothes for herself as would
last a year; that was the rule. We used to stitch everything at home
in those days--everything; and we had what we called a ``bottom drawer''
to store them in. As soon as a girl passed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fifteenth birthday, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
began to sew for the ``bottom drawer.<div class="bookquote">'' But all those things change so,
I dare say it's different now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much will it cost to buy everything, do you think?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna asked.

<p/>Just then Beatrice entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beatrice, Anna is inquiring how much it will cost to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
trousseau, and the house-linen. What do you say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice replied, without any hesitation, 'a couple of hundred at
least.''

<p/>Mrs. Sutton, reading Anna's face, smiled reassuringly. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Bee!
I dare say you could do it on a hundred with care, Anna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should Anna want to do it with care?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>Beatrice asked curtly.

<p/>Anna went straight across the road to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) father, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for a
hundred pounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) own money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), save under
necessity, since the evening spent at the Suttons'.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's afoot now?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) questioned savagely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must buy things for the wedding--clothes and things, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay! clothes! clothes! What clothes dost want? A few pounds will
cover them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There'll be all the linen for the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Linen for-- It's none thy place for buy that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father, it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say it isna'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shouted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I've asked Mrs. Sutton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) says it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What business an' ye for go blabbing thy affairs all over Bosley? I
say it isna' thy place for buy linen, and let that be sufficient. Go
and get dinner. It's nigh on twelve now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening, when Agnes had gone to bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) resumed the struggle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father, I must have that hundred pounds. I really must. I mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'_Thou means it_! What?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean I must have a hundred pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd advise thee to tak' care o' thy tongue, my lass. _Thou means it_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you needn't give it me all at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) pursued.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>), glowering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shanna' give it thee. It's Henry's place for buy th' house-linen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Father, it isn``t.'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) voice broke, but only for an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I'm
asking you for my own money. You seem to want to make me miserable
just before my wedding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to God thou `dst never seen Henry Mynors. It's given thee
pride and made thee undutiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm only asking you for my own money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) calm insistence maddened him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Jumping up from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
stamped out of the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strike a match in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
office. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) returned, and threw angrily on to the table in
front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) a cheque-book and pass-book. The deposit-book she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) had
always kept herself for convenience of paying into the bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said scornfully, `tak' thy traps and ne'er speak to me
again. I wash my hands of ye. Tak' 'em and do what ye'n a mind.
Chuck thy money into th' cut-LSB-1-RSB- for aught I care.''

<p/>The next evening Henry came up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face had a grave
look, but intent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) own difficulties she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) did not remark on it, and
proceeded at once to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Agnes</b></font>) resolved to do. It was a cold night
in November, yet the miser, wrathfully sullen, chose to sit in his (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>)
office without a fire. Agnes was working sums in the kitchen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna began, <div class="bookquote">``I've had a difficulty with father, and I must
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not about the wedding, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was about money. Of course, Henry, I can't get married without a
lot of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've my own things to get,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said, `and I've all the house-linen to
buy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! You buy the house-linen, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>miser</b></font>) was relieved
by that information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. Well, I told father I must have a hundred pounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wouldn't give it me. And when I stuck to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got angry--you know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
can't bear to see money spent--and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) get a little savage and
gave me my bank-books, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d have nothing more to do with my
money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry's face broke into a laugh, and Anna was obliged to smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Capital!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want you to tell me how much I've got in the bank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I
only know I'm always paying in odd cheques.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) examined the three books. <div class="bookquote">``A very tidy bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said; `something
over two hundred and fifty pounds. So you can draw cheques at your
ease.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Draw me a cheque for twenty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said; and then, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
wrote: <div class="bookquote">``Henry, after we're married, I shall want you to take charge of
all this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course; I will do that, dear. But your money will be yours.
There ought to be a settlement on you. Still, if your father says
nothing, it is not for me to say anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father will say nothing--now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You've never shown any
interest in it, Henry; but as we're talking of money, I may as well
tell you that father says I'm worth fifty thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man of business was astonished and enraptured beyond measure. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
countenance shone with delight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely not!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protested formally.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what father told me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made me read a list of shares, and
so on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go slow, to begin with,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors solemnly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had not
expected more than fifteen, or twenty thousand pounds, and even this
sum had dazzled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had only taken
the house at Toft End on a yearly tenancy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) now saw himself the
dominant figure in all the Five Towns.

<p/>Later in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) disclosed, perfunctorily, the matter which had
been a serious weight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) entered the house, but which
this revelation of vast wealth had diminished to a trifle. Titus Price
had been the treasurer of the building fund which the bazaar was
designed to assist. Mynors had assumed the position of the dead man,
and that day, in going through the accounts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) had discovered that a
sum of fifty pounds was missing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a dreadful thing for Willie, if it gets about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said; 'a tale
of that sort would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) to Australia.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Henry, it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) exclaimed, sorrow-stricken, `but we mustn't let
it get about. Let us pay the money ourselves. You must enter it in
the books and say nothing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``I can't alter the accounts. At
least I can't alter the bank-book and the vouchers. The auditor would
detect it in a minute. Besides, I should not be doing my duty if I
kept a thing like this from the Superintendent-minister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), at any
rate, must know, and perhaps the stewards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can urge them to say nothing. Tell them that you will make it
good. I will write a cheque at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had meant to find the fifty myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) said. It was a peddling sum
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me pay half, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) urged, smiling faintly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) eagerness. <div class="bookquote">``The thing
is bound to be kept quiet--it would create such a frightful scandal.
Poor old chap!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) added, carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was hard run, and
meant to put it back--as they all do mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was useless for Mynors to affect depression of spirits, or
mournful sympathy with the errors of a dead sinner. The fifty thousand
danced a jig in his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) brain that night.

<p/>Anna was absorbed in contemplating the misfortune of Willie Price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
prayed wildly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) might never learn the full depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) father's
fall. The miserable robbery of Sarah's wages was buried for evermore,
and this new delinquency, which all would regard as flagrant sacrilege,
must be buried also. A soul less loyal than Anna's might have feared
that Willie, a self-convicted forger, had been a party to the
embezzlement; but Anna knew that it could not be so.

<p/>It was characteristic of Mynors' cautious prudence that, the first
intoxication having passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) made no further reference of any kind to
Anna's fortune. The arrangements for their married life were planned
on a scale which ignored the fifty thousand pounds. For both their
sakes he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) wished to avoid all friction with the miser, at any rate until
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) status as Anna's husband would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) to enforce her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) rights, if
that should be necessary, with dignity and effectiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) did not
precisely anticipate trouble, but the fact had not escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) that
Ephraim still held the whole of Anna's securities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) was in no hurry
to enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) borders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) knew that there were twenty-four hours in
every day, three hundred and sixty-five days in every year, and thirty
good years in life still left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>); and therefore that there would be
ample time, after the wedding, for the execution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) purposes in
regard to that fifty thousand pounds. Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) told Anna that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>)
had set aside two hundred pounds for the purchase of furniture for the
Priory--a modest sum; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) judged it sufficient. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) method was to
buy a piece at a time, always second-hand, but always good. The
bargain-hunt was up, and Anna soon yielded to its mild satisfactions.
In the matter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) trousseau and the house-linen, Anna, having
obtained the needed money--at so dear a cost--found yet another
obstacle in the imminent bazaar, which occupied Mrs. Sutton and
Beatrice so completely that they could not contrive any opportunity to
assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Beatrice</b></font>) in shopping. It was decided between them that every article
should be bought ready-made and seamed, and that the first week of the
New Year, if indeed Mrs. Sutton survived the bazaar, should be entirely
and absolutely devoted to Anna's business.

<p/>At nights, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had leisure to think, Anna was astonished how
during the day she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) preoccupations in the activities
precendent to the bazaar, or in choosing furniture with Mynors. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) never slept without thinking of Willie Price, and hoping that no
further disaster might overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>). The incident of the embezzled
fifty pounds had been closed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had given a cheque for
twenty-five pounds to Mynors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had acquainted the minister with the
facts, and Mr. Banks had decided that the two circuit stewards must be
informed. Beyond these the scandalous secret was not to go. But Anna
wondered whether a secret shared by five persons could long remain a
secret.

<p/>The bazaar was a triumphant and unparalleled success, and, of the seven
stalls, the Sunday-school stall stood first each night in the nightly
returns. The scene in the town-hall, on the fourth and final night, a
Saturday, was as delirious and gay as a carnival. Four hundred and
twenty pounds had been raised up to tea-time, and it was the
impassioned desire of everyone to achieve five hundred. The price of
admission had been reduced to threepence, in order that the artisan
might enter and spend his (<font color='blue'><b>artisan</b></font>) wages in an excellent cause. The seven
stalls, ranged round the room like so many bowers of beauty, draped and
frilled and floriated, and still laden with countless articles of use
and ornament, were continually reinforced with purchasers by emissaries
canvassing the crowd which filled the middle of the paper-strewn floor.
The horse was not only taken to the water, but compelled to drink; and
many a man who, outside, would have laughed at the risk of being
robbed, was robbed openly, shamelessly, under the gaze of ministers and
class-leaders. Bouquets were sold at a shilling each, and at the
refreshment stall a glass of milk cost sixpence. The noise rivalled
that of a fair; there was no quiet anywhere, save in the farthest
recess of each stall, where the lady in supreme charge of it, like a
spider in the middle of its web, watched customers and cash-box with
equal cupidity.

<p/>Mrs. Sutton, at seven o'clock, had not returned from tea, and Anna and
Beatrice, who managed the Sunday-school stall in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) absence, feared
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had at last succumbed under the strain. But shortly
afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hurried back breathless to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See that, Anna? It will be reckoned in our returns,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said,
exhibiting a piece of paper. It was Ephraim's cheque for twenty-five
pounds promised months ago, but on a condition which had not been
fulfilled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) has the secret of persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>thought Anna. <div class="bookquote">``Why have I
never found it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Agnes</b></font>)</div><p/>Then Agnes, in a new white frock, came up with three shillings,
proceeds of bouquets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must take that to the flower-stall, my pet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't I give it to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>the child pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I want your stall to be
the best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div><p/>Mynors arrived next, with something concealed in tissue-paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>)
removed the paper, and showed, in a frame of crimson plush, a common
white plate decorated with a simple band and line, and a monogram in
the centre--<div class="bookquote">``A.T.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Anna blushed, recognising the plate which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had
painted that afternoon in July at Mynors' works.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you sell this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>Mynors asked Mrs. Sutton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sutton doubtfully--not in the secret. <div class="bookquote">``What's
it meant for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to sell it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mynors/Henry/Henry Mynors</b></font>)</div>said Mynors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sutton</b></font>) laughed, `what will you give?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A couple of sovereigns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make it guineas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) paid the money, and requested Anna to keep the plate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>).

<p/>At nine o'clock it was announced that, though raffling was forbidden,
the bazaar would be enlivened by an auction. A licensed auctioneer was
brought, and the sale commenced. The auctioneer, however, failed to
attune himself to the wild spirit of the hour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>) professional
efforts would have resulted in a fiasco had not Mynors, perceiving the
danger, leaped to the platform and masterfully assumed the hammer.
Mynors surpassed himself in the kind of wit that amuses an excited
crowd, and the auction soon monopolised the attention of the room; it
was always afterwards remembered as the crowning success of the bazaar.
The incredible man took ten pounds in twenty minutes. During this
episode Anna, who had been left alone in the stall, first noticed
Willie Price in the room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) ship sailed on the Monday, but steerage
passengers had to be aboard on Sunday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was saying good-bye to a
few acquaintances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) seemed quite cheerful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) walked about with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) pockets, chatting with this one and that; it was the
false and hysterical gaiety that precedes a final separation. As soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) saw Anna he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye, Miss Tellwright,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) said jauntily. <div class="bookquote">``I leave for
Liverpool to-morrow morning. Wish me luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing more; no word, no accent, to recall the terrible but sublime
past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) answered. They shook hands. Others approaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>)
drifted away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) glance followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) like a beneficent influence.

<p/>For three days she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) pocket an envelope containing a
bank-note for a hundred pounds, intending by some device to force it on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) as a parting gift. Now the last chance was lost, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had not
even attempted this difficult feat of charity. Such futility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
reflected, self-scorning, was of a piece with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hasn't
really gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hasn't really gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) kept repeating, and yet knew
well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what they are saying, Anna?''  (<font color='red'><b>Beatrice/Sutton/Beatrice Sutton</b></font>)</div>said Beatrice, when, after
eleven o'clock, the bazaar was closed to the public, and the
stall-holders and their assistants were preparing to depart, their
movements hastened by the stern aspect of the town-hall keeper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>said Anna; and in the same moment guessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They say old Titus Price embezzled fifty pounds from the building
fund, and Henry made it up, privately, so that there shouldn't be a
scandal. Just fancy! Do you believe it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The secret was abroad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) looked round the room, and saw it in every
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who says?''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna demanded fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all over the place. Miss Dickinson told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will be glad to know, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mynors' voice sang out from the
platform, `that the total proceeds, so far as we can calculate them
now, exceed five hundred and twenty-five pounds.''

<p/>There was clapping of hands, which died out suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Agnes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Anna/Miss Anna</b></font>)</div>Anna called, `come along, quick; you're as white as a
sheet. Good-night, Mrs. Sutton; good-night, Bee.''

<p/>Mynors was still occupied on the platform.

<p/>The town-hall keeper extinguished some of the lights. The bazaar was
over.

<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>END OF A SIMPLE SOUL

<p/>The next morning, at half-past seven, Anna was standing in the
garden-doorway of the Priory. The sun had just risen, the air was
cold; roof and pavement were damp; rain had fallen, and more was to
fall. A door opened higher up the street, and Willie Price came out,
carrying a small bag. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) turned to speak to some person within the
house, and then stepped forward. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) passed Anna she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) sprang forth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I had just come up here to see if the workmen had
locked up properly. We have some of our new furniture in the house,
you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) was as red as the sun over Hillport.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have _you_ heard?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) asked simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About what?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) whispered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About my poor old father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I was hoping--hoping you would never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>By a common impulse they went into the garden of the Priory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
shut the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! they took care to tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A silence followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that your luggage?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) inquired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) lifted up the handbag, and
nodded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I'm only an emigrant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a note here for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I should have posted it to
the steamer; but now you can take it yourself. I want you not to read
it till you get to Melbourne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said, and crumpled the proffered envelope into his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was not thinking of the note at all. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) asked:
<div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell me about my father? If I had to hear it, I'd
sooner have heard it from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must try to forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You are not your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never been born,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd gone to prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Now was the moment when, if ever, the mother's influence should be
exerted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be a man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said softly. <div class="bookquote">``I did the best I could for you. I shall
always think of you, in Australia, getting on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said again, passionately:
<div class="bookquote">``I shall always remember you--always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The hand with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm shook like an old man's hand.
As their eyes met in an intense and painful gaze, to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), at least, it
was revealed that they were lovers. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had learnt in that instant
can only be guessed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) next action...


<p/>Anna ran out of the garden into the street, and so home, never looking
behind to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) way to the station.

<p/>Some may argue that Anna, knowing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) loved another man, ought not to
have married Mynors. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) did not reason thus; such a notion never
even occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had promised to marry Mynors, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
married him (<font color='blue'><b>Mynors</b></font>). Nothing else was possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) who had never failed in
duty did not fail then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) who had always submitted and bowed the
head, submitted and bowed the head then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had sucked in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>)
mother's milk the profound truth that a woman's life is always a
renunciation, greater or less. Hers by chance was greater. Facing the
future calmly and genially, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) took oath with herself to be a good
wife to the man whom, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellences, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) had never loved.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) thoughts often dwelt lovingly on Willie Price, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) deemed to
be pursuing in Australia an honourable and successful career, quickened
at the outset by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) hundred pounds. This vision of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willie</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) stay.
But neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) nor anyone in the Five Towns or elsewhere ever heard of
Willie Price again. And well might none hear! The abandoned pitshaft
does not deliver up its secret. And so--the Bank of England is the
richer by a hundred pounds unclaimed, and the world the poorer by a
simple and meek soul stung to revolt only in its last hour.
