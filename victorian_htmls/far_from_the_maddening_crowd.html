noted chapter 72 was missing, and we are replacing it when we do

did not receive much, if any, response to this method of release

<p/>FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD

<p/>CHAPTER I



<p/>DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK -- AN INCIDENT


<p/>When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) mouth
spread till they were within an unimportant distance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) ears, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging
wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of
the rising sun.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) Christian name was Gabriel, and on working
days he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was a young man of sound judgment, easy
motions, proper dress, and general good character. On
Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a man of misty views, rather given to
postponing, and hampered by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) best clothes and
umbrella: upon the whole, one who felt himself to
occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean
neutrality which lay between the Communion people
of the parish and the drunken section, -- that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went
to church, but yawned privately by the time the con-
gegation reached the Nicene creed,- and thought of
what there would be for dinner when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) meant to be
listening to the sermon. Or, to state his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) character as
it stood in the scale of public opinion, when his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) friends
and critics were in tantrums, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was considered rather a
bad man; when they were pleased, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was rather a good
man; when they were neither, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a man whose
moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture.
Since he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) lived six times as many working-days as
Sundays, Oak's appearance in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) old clothes was most
peculiarly his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own -- the mental picture formed by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
neighbours in imagining him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being always dressed in
that way. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out
at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security
in high winds, and a coat like Dr. Johnson's; his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) lower
extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings
and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a
roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might
stand in a river all day long and know nothing of
damp -- their maker being a conscientious man who
endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cut
by unstinted dimension and solidity.
Mr. Oak carried about him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>), by way of watch,-
what may be called a small silver clock; in other
words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and
a small clock as to size. This instrument being several
years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity
of going either too fast or not at all. The smaller
of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round on the
pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with
precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour
they belonged to. The stopping peculiarity of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
escaped any evil consequences from the other two
defects by constant comparisons with and observations
of the sun and stars, and by pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) face close
to the glass of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) neighbours' windows, till he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) could
discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers
within. It may be mentioned that Oak's fob being
difficult of access, by reason of its somewhat high
situation in the waistband of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) trousers -LRB-which also
lay at a remote height under his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) waistcoat-RRB-, the watch
was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to
one side, compressing the mouth and face to a mere
mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion, and
drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a
well.
But some thoughtfull persons, who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
walking across one of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) fields on a certain December
morning -- sunny and exceedingly mild -- might have
regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these. In
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) face one might notice that many of the hues and
curves of youth had tarried on to manhood: there even
remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) remoter crannies some relics of the boy.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) height and breadth would have been sufficient to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) presence imposing, had they been exhibited
with due consideration. But there is a way some men
have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more
responsible than flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtail-
ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them.
And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had no great claim on the world's room, Oak
walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible
bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.
This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
depends for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) valuation more upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) appearance
than upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had just reached the time of life at which <div class="bookquote">``young''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>is ceasing to be the prefix of <div class="bookquote">``man''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>in speaking of one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was at the brightest period of masculine growth,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) intellect and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) emotions were clearly separated:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had passed the time during which the influence of
youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
of impulse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had not yet arrived at the stage
wherein they become united again, in the character of
prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family. In
short, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.
The field he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was in this morning sloped to a
ridge called Norcombe Hill. Through a spur of this
hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk-
Newton. Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw
coming down the incline before him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) an ornamental
spring waggon, painted yellow and gaily marked,
drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside
bearing a whip perpendicularly. The waggon was
laden with household goods and window plants, and
on the apex of the whole sat a woman, <div class="bookquote">``young''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>and
attractive. Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a
standstill just beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>the waggoner</b></font>)</div>said the
waggoner.
<div class="bookquote">``Then I heard it fall.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, in a soft, though
not particularly low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I heard a noise I could
not account for when we were coming up the hill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll run back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered.
The sensible horses stood -- perfectly still, and the
waggoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.
The girl on the summit of the load sat motionless,
surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards,
backed by an oak settle, and ornamented in front by
pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses, together with
a caged canary -- all probably from the windows of the
house just vacated. There was also a cat in a willow
basket, from the partly-opened lid of which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gazed
with half-closed eyes, and affectionately-surveyed the
small birds around.
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
place, and the only sound heard in the stillness was the
hopping of the canary up-and down the perches of its
prison. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked attentively downwards. It
was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong
package tied in paper, and lying between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head to learn if the waggoner were coming.
He (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) was not yet in sight; and her-eyes crept back to
the package, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoughts seeming to run upon what
was inside it. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew the article into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
lap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing
looking-glass was disclosed, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) proceeded to
survey herself attentively. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips and
smiled.
It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a
scarlet glow the crimson jacket she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wore, and painted
a soft lustre upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright face and dark hair. The
myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
were fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they
invested the whole concern of horses, waggon, furniture,
and girl with a peculiar vernal charm. What possessed
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the
sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were
alone its spectators, -- whether the smile began as a
factitious one, to test her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) capacity in that art, -- nobody
knows; it ended certainly in a real smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) blushed
at herself, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reflection blush, blushed the
more.
The change from the customary spot and necessary
occasion of such an act -- from the dressing hour in a
bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors -- lent to
the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.
The picture was a delicate one. Woman's prescriptive
infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had
clothed it in the freshness of an originality. A
cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
regarded the scene, generous though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fain would have
been. There was no necessity whatever for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) looking
in the glass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) did not adjust her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) hat, or pat her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>)
hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing to
signify that any such intention had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) motive in
taking up the glass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) simply observed herself as a
fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) thoughts
seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in
which men would play a part -- vistas of probable
triumphs -- the smiles being of a phase suggesting that
hearts were imagined as lost and won. Still, this was
but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was so
idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention
had any part in them at all.
The waggoner's steps were heard returning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>)
put the glass in the paper, and the whole again into its
place.
When the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) point of espial, and descending into the road,
followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way
beyond the bottom of the hill, where the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
contemplation now halted for the payment of toll. About
twenty steps still remained between him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and the gate,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heard a dispute. lt was a difference con-
cerning twopence between the persons with the waggon
and the man at the toll-bar.
<div class="bookquote">``Mis`ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) says that's enough that I've offered ye, you great
miser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) won't pay any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>the waggoner</b></font>)</div>These were the
waggoner's words.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well; then mis`ess's niece can't pass.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the
turnpike-keeper, closing the gate.
Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants,
and fell into a reverie. There was something in the
tone of twopence remarkably insignificant. Threepence
had a definite value as money -- it was an appreciable
infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a higgling
matter; but twopence -- <div class="bookquote">'' Here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) said, stepping
forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper; <div class="bookquote">``let
the young woman pass.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gatekeeper</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) then;
she (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) words, and looked down.
Gabriel's features adhered throughout their form so
exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St.
John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot, as represented
in a window of the church he (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) attended, that not a single
lineament could be selected and called worthy either of
distinction or notoriety. The redjacketed and dark-
haired maiden seemed to think so too, for she (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) carelessly
glanced over him (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) man to drive on. She (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>)
might have looked her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) thanks to Gabriel on a minute
scale, but she (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) did not speak them; more probably she (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>)
felt none, for in gaining her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) a passage he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>)
her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) point, and we know how women take a favour of
that kind.
The gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a handsome maid''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) said to Oak
<div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) faults.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``True, farmer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the greatest of them is -- well, what it is
always.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Beating people down? ay, `tis so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel, perhaps a little piqued by the comely
traveller's indifference, glanced back to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
witnessed her (<font color='blue'><b>waggoner</b></font>) performance over the hedge, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``Vanity.''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER II



<p/>NIGHT -- THE FLOCK -- AN INTERIOR -- ANOTHER INTERIOR


<p/>IT was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas's, the
shortest day in the year. A desolating wind wandered
from the north over the hill whereon Oak had watched
the yellow waggon and its occupant in the sunshine of
a few days earlier.
Norcombe Hill -- not far from lonely Toller-Down
-- was one of the spots which suggest to a passer-by
that he (<font color='blue'><b>passer-by</b></font>) is in the presence of a shape approaching the
indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth.
It was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil -- an
ordinary specimen of those smoothly-outlined protuber-
ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
some great day of confusion, when far grander heights
and dizzy granite precipices topple down.
The hill was covered on its northern side by an
ancient and decaying plantation of beeches, whose
upper verge formed a line over the crest, fringing its
arched curve against the sky, like a mane. To-night
these trees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest
blasts, which smote the wood and floundered through
it with a sound as of grumbling, or gushed over its
crowning boughs in a weakened moan. The dry leaves
in the ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes,
a tongue of air occasionally ferreting out a few, and
sending them spinning across the grass. A group or
two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
had remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs
which bore them and in falling rattled against the trunks
with smart taps:
Between this half-wooded, half naked hill, and the
vague still horizon that its summit indistinctly com-
manded, was a mysterious sheet of fathomless shade
-- the sounds from which suggested that what it con-
cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here.
The thin grasses, more or less coating the hill, were
touched by the wind in breezes of differing powers, and
almost of differing natures -- one rubbing the blades
heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing
them like a soft broom. The instinctive act of human-
kind was to stand and listen, and learn how the trees
to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
choir; how hedges and other shapes to leeward them
caught the note, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and
how the hurrying gust then plunged into the south, to
be heard no more.
The sky was clear -- remarkably clear -- and the
twinkling of all the stars seemed to be but throbs of
one body, timed by a common pulse. The North Star
was directly in the wind's eye, and since evening the
Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east, till he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
was now at a right angle with the meridian. A
difference of colour in the stars -- oftener read of than
seen in England-was really perceptible here. The
sovereign brilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely
glitter, the star called Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and
Betelgueux shone with a fiery red.
To persons standing alone on a hill during a clear
midnight such as this, the roll of the world eastward is
almost a palpable movement. The sensation may be
caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of still-
ness, or by the better outlook upon space that a hill
affords, or by the wind, or by the solitude; but whatever
be its origin, the impression of riding along is vivid and
abiding. The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it
is necessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the
night, and, having first expanded with a sense of differ-
ence from the mass of civilised mankind, who are
dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at
this time, long and quietly watch your stately progress
through the stars. After such a nocturnal reconnoitre
it is hard to get back to earth, and to believe that the
consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from
a tiny human frame.
Suddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to
be heard in this place up against the sky. They had a
clearness which was to be found nowhere in the wind,
and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
nature. They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
air: it seemed muffled in some way, and was altogether
too curtailed in power to spread high or wide. It came
from the direction of a small dark object under the
plantation hedge -- a shepherd's hut -- now presenting
an outline to which an uninitiated person might have
been puzzled to attach either meaning or use.
The image as a whole was that of a small Noah's
Ark on a small Ararat, allowing the traditionary outlines
and general form of the Ark which are followed by toy-
makers -- and by these means are established in men's
imaginations among their firmest, because earliest im-
pressions -- to pass as an approximate pattern. The
hut stood on little wheels, which raised its floor about a
foot from the ground. Such shepherds' huts are dragged
into the fields when the lambing season comes on, to
shelter the shepherd in his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)- enforced nightly attendance.
It was only latterly that people had begun to call
Gabriel <div class="bookquote">``Farmer''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Oak. During the twelvemonth pre-
ceding this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been enabled by sustained
efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the
small sheep farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion,
and stock it with two hundred sheep. Previously he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>)
had been a bailiff for a short time, and earlier still a
shepherd only, having from his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) childhood assisted his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till old
Gabriel sank to rest.
This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of
farming as master and not as man, with an advance of
sheep not yet paid for, was a critical juncture with
Gabriel Oak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) position clearly.
The first movement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) new progress was the lambing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) ewes, and sheep having been his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) speciality from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) wisely refrained from deputing -- the task
of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice.
The wind continued to beat-about the corners of the
hut, but the flute-playing ceased. A rectangular space
of light appeared in the side of the hut, and in the
opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) carried
a lantern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) hand, and closing the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>),
came forward and busied himself about this nook of the
field for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light appear-
ing and disappearing here and there, and brightening
him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) or darkening him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) stood before or behind it.
Oak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were
slow, and their deliberateness accorded well with his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)
occupation. Fitness being the basis of beauty, nobody
could-have denied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) steady swings and turns''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in and- about the flock had elements of grace, Yet,
although if occasion demanded he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) could do or think a
thing with as mercurial a dash as can the men of towns
who are more to the manner born, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) special power,
morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing
little or nothing to momentum as a rule.
A close examination of the ground hereabout, even
by the wan starlight only, revealed how a portion of
what would have been casually called a wild slope had
been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) great purpose
this winter. Detached hurdles thatched with straw
were stuck into the ground at various scattered points,
amid and under which the whitish forms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) meek
ewes moved and rustled. The ring of the sheep-bell,
which had been silent during his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) absence, recommenced,
in tones that had more mellowness than clearness, owing
to an increasing growth of surrounding wool. This
continued till Oak withdrew again from the flock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
-- returned to the hut, bringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) arms a new-born
lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for a full-
grown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable mem-
brane about half the substance of the legs collectively,
which constituted the animal's entire body just at present.
The little speck of life he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) placed on a wisp of hay
before the small stove, where a can of milk was simmer-
ing. Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it
and then pinching the snuff, the cot being lighted
by a candle suspended by a twisted wire. A rather
hard couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly
down, covered half the floor of this little habitation, and
here the young man stretched himself along, loosened
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woollen cravat, and closed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. In about the
time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would have
decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.
The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was
cosy and alluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in
addition to the candle, reflecting its own genial colour
upon whatever it could reach, flung associations of
enjoyment even over utensils and tools. In the corner
stood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side
were ranged bottles and canisters of the simple prepara-
tions pertaining to bovine surgery and physic; spirits of
wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger, and castor-oil
being the chief. On a triangular shelf across the corner
stood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider,
which was supplied from a flagon beneath. Beside the
provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately been
called forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious
hour. The house was ventilated by two round holes,
like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides-
The lamb, revived by the warmth began to bleat''
instant meaning, as expected sounds will. Passing
from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness
with the same ease that had accompanied the reverse
operation, he (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) watch, found that the hour-
hand had shifted again, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) hat, took the lamb
in his (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) arms, and carried it into the darkness. After
placing the little creature with its mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) stood and
carefully examined the sky, to ascertain the time of
night from the altitudes of the stars.
The Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless
Pleiades, were half-way up the Southern sky, and between
them hung Orion, which gorgeous constellation never
burnt more vividly than now, as it soared forth above
the rim of the landscape. Castor and Pollux will
the north-west; far away through the plantation Vega
and Cassiopeia's chair stood daintily poised on the
uppermost boughs. ``One o'clock.'' said Gabriel.
Being a man not without a frequent consciousness
that there was some charm in this life he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) led, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood
still after looking at the sky as a useful instrument, and
regarded it in an appreciative spirit, as a work of art
superlatively beautiful. For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) seemed
impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or
rather with the complete abstraction from all its compass
of the sights and sounds of man. Human shapes,interferences,
troubles, and joys were all as if they were not, and there
seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient
being save himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could fancy them all gone round to the sunny side.
Occupied this, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually per-
ceived that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had previously taken to be a star low
down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no
such thing. It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
To find themselves utterly alone at night where company
is desirable and expected makes some people fearful; but a
case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some
mysterious companionship when intuition, sensation, memory,
analogy, testimony, probability, induction -- every kind of
evidence in the logician's list -- have united to persuade con-
sciousness that it is quite in isolation.
Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed
through its lower boughs to the windy side. A dim mass under
the slope reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) that a shed occupied a place here,
the site being a cutting into the slope of the hill, so that at
its back part the roof was almost level with the ground. In
front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with
tar as a preservative. Through crevices in the roof and side
spread streaks and spots of light, a combination of which made
the radiance that had attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>). Oak stepped up behind,
where,leaning down upon the roof and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) eye close
to a hole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) could see into the interior clearly.
The place contained two women and two cows. By the side
of the latter a steaming bran-mash stood in a bucket. One
of the women was past middle age. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) companion was ap-
parently young and graceful; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could form no decided opinion
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) looks, her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) position being almost beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eye, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) in a bird's-eye view, as Milton's Satan first saw
Paradise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) wore no bonnet or het, but had enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>)-
self in a large cloak, which was carelessly flung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) head
as a covering.
``There, now we'll go home,'' said the elder of the two, resting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) knuckles upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) hips, and looking at their goings-on as
a whole. ``I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now. I have
never been more frightened in my life, but I don't mind break-
ing my rest if she (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) recovers.''
The young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined
to fall together on the smallest provocation of silence,yawned
in sympathy.
``I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these
things,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
``As we are not, we must do them ourselves,'' said the other;
``for you must help me if you stay.''
``Well, my hat is gone, however,'' continued the younger. ``It
went over the hedge, I think. The idea of such a slight wind
catching it.''
The cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was
encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely
uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had been dipped in
a dye of that colour, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long back being mathematically level.
The other was spotted,grey and white. Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Oak now
noticed a little calf about a day old, looking idiotically at
the two women, which showed that it had not long been
accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turn-
ing to the lantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon.
inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction
by experience. Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had
been busy on Norcombe hill lately.
``I think we had better send for some oatmeal,'' said the
``Yes, aunt; and I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light.''
``But there's no side-saddle.''
<div class="bookquote">``I can ride on the other: trust me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more
curious to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features, but this prospect being
denied him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by the hooding effect of the cloak, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
aerial position, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt himself drawing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fancy
for their details. In making even horizontal and clear
inspections we colour and mould according to the warts
within us whatever our eyes bring in. Had Gabriel
been able from the first to get a distinct view of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -
countenance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) estimate of it as very handsome or
slightly so would have been as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) soul required a
divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one.
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
form to fill an increasing void within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) position
moreover affording the widest scope for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
painted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a beauty.
By one of those whimsical coincidences in which
Nature, like a busy mother, seems to spare a moment
from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unremitting labours to turn and make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and
forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.
Oak knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) instantly as the heroine of the yellow
waggon, myrtles, and looking-glass: prosily, as the
woman who owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) twopence.
They placed the calf beside its mother again, took
up the lantern, and went out, the light sinking down
the hill till it was no more than a nebula. Gabriel
Oak returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) flock.




<p/>CHAPTER III



<p/>A GIRL ON HORSEBACK -- CONVERSATION


<p/>THE sluggish day began to break. Even its position
terrestrially is one of the elements of a new interest,
and for no particular reason save that the incident of
the night had occurred there, Oak went again into
the plantation. Lingering and musing here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) heard
the steps of a horse at the foot of the hill, and soon
there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
its back, ascending by the path leading past the cattle-
shed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the young woman of the night before.
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had mentioned
as having lost in the wind; possibly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to
look for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hastily scanned the ditch and after
walking about ten yards along it, found the hat among the
leaves. Gabriel took it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand and returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
hut. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ensconced himself, and peeped through
the loophole in the direction of the riders approach.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came up and looked around -- then on the other
side of the hedge. Gabriel was about to advance and
restore the missing article when an unexpected per-
formance induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to suspend the action for the
present. The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected
the plantation. It was not a bridle-path -- merely a
pedestrian's track, and the boughs spread horizontally
at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground,
which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them.
The girl, who wore no riding-habit, looked around for
a moment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was
out of view, then dexterously dropped backwards flat
upon the pony's back, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head over its tail, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet
against its shoulders, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes to the sky. The
rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glide into this position was that of a
kingfisher -- its noiselessness that of a hawk. Gabriel's
eyes had scarcely been able to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The tall lank
pony seemed used to such doings, and ambled
along unconcerned. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) passed under the level boughs.
The performer seemed quite at home anywhere
between a horse's head and its tail, and the necessity
for this abnormal attitude having ceased with the
passage of the plantation, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to adopt another,
even more obviously convenient than the first. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
no side-saddle, and it was very apparent that a firm
seat upon the smooth leather beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was un-
attainable sideways. Springing to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) accustomed
perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
self that nobody was in sight, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seated herself in the
manner demanded by the saddle, though hardly expected
of the woman, and trotted off in the direction of Tewnell
Mill.
Oak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and
hanging up the hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hut, went again among his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ewes. An hour passed, the girl returned, properly
seated now, with a bag of bran in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). On
nearing the cattle-shed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was met by a boy bringing
a milking-pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slid off. The boy led away the horse, leaving the
pail with the young woman.
Soon soft shirts alternating with loud shirts came
in regular succession from within the shed, the obvious
sounds of a person milking a cow. Gabriel took the
lost hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand, and waited beside the path she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
would follow in leaving the hill.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knee. The left arm was extended as a balance, enough
of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event
ha happened in the summer, when the whole would
have been revealed. There was a bright air and manner
about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to imply that the
desirability of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) existence could not be questioned;
and this rather saucy assumption failed in being offensive,
because a beholder felt it to be, upon the whole, true.
Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius, that
which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an
addition to recognised power. It was with some
surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw Gabriel's face rising like the
moon behind the hedge.
The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
charms to the portrait of herself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now presented
him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) with was less a diminution than a difference. The
starting-point selected by the judgment was. her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) height
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the
hedge diminutive; hence, making allowance for error
by comparison with these, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could have been not
above the height to be chosen by women as best. All
features of consequence were severe and regular. It
may have been observed by persons who go about the
shires with eyes for beauty, that in Englishwoman a
classically-formed face is seldom found to be united
with a figure of the same pattern, the highly-finished
features being generally too large for the remainder of
the frame; that a graceful and proportionate figure of
eight heads usually goes off into random facial curves.
Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid,
let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out
of place, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) proportions with a long
consciousness of pleasure. From the contours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>)
figure in its upper part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) must have had a beautiful
neck and shoulders; but since her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) infancy nobody had
ever seen them. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) been put into a low dress
she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) would have run and thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) head into a bush.
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) was not a shy girl by any means; it was merely
her (<font color='blue'><b>Englishwoman</b></font>) instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the
unseen higher than they do it in towns.
That the girl's thoughts hovered about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face
and form as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) caught Oak's eyes conning the
same page was natural, and almost certain. The self-
consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little
more pronounced, dignity if a little less. Rays of male
vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces
in rural districts; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brushed hers with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, as if
Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual
touch, and the free air of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) previous movements was
reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of
itself. Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not
at all.
<div class="bookquote">``I found a hat.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``It is mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), and, from a sense of proportion,
kept down to a small smile an inclination to laugh dis-
tinctly: <div class="bookquote">``it flew away last night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>proportion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``One o'clock this morning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well -- it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was surprised. <div class="bookquote">``How did you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I was here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are Farmer Oak, are you not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That or thereabouts. I'm lately come to this place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A large farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) inquired, casting her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eyes round,
and swinging back her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hair, which was black in the
shaded hollows of its mass; but it being now an hour
past sunrise, the rays touched its prominent curves with
a colour of their own.
<div class="bookquote">``No; not large. About a hundred.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-In speaking
of farms the word <div class="bookquote">``acres''  (<font color='red'><b>the natives</b></font>)</div>is omitted by the natives, by
analogy to such old expressions as <div class="bookquote">``a stag of ten.'' (<font color='red'><b>the natives</b></font>)</div>-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted my hat this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) went on.
<div class="bookquote">``I had to ride to Tewnell Mill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes you had.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) inquired, a misgiving bringing every
muscle of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lineaments and frame to a standstill.
<div class="bookquote">``Here-going through the plantation, and all down
the hill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Farmer Oak</b></font>)</div>said Farmer Oak, with an aspect excessively
knowing with regard to some matter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) mind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and then
turned back to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) colloquist's eyes.
A perception caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) to withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) own eyes
from hers as suddenly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had been caught in a
theft. Recollection of the strange antics she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had
indulged in when passing through the trees, was suc-
ceeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by
a hot face. It was a time to see a woman redden who
was not given to reddening as a rule; not a point in
the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour. From
the Maiden's Blush, through all varieties of the Provence
down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's
acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), in con-
siderateness, turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) head.
The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and
wondered when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would recover coolness sufficient to
justify him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in facing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) heard what seemed
to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze, and
looked. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone away.
With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy!
Gabriel returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) work.
Five mornings and evenings passed. The young
woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to
attend to the sick one, but never allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vision to
stray in the direction of Oak's person. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) want of
tact had deeply offended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -- not by seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
could not help, but by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
seen it. For, as without law there is no sin, without
eyes there is no indecorum; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared to feel
that Gabriel's espial had made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) an indecorous woman
without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own connivance. It was food for great regret
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>); it was also a contretemps which touched into
life a latent heat he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had experienced in that direction.
The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in
a slow forgetting, but for an incident which occurred at
the end of the same week. One afternoon it began to
freeze, and the frost increased with evening, which drew
on like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time
when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to
the sheets; when round the drawing-room fire of a
thick-walled mansion the sitters' backs are cold, even
whilst their faces are all aglow. Many a small bird went
to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.
As the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) usual
watch upon the cowshed. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) felt cold, and
shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the yearling
ewes he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon
the stove. The wind came in at the bottom of the door,
and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the
cot round a little more to the south. Then the wind
spouted in at a ventilating hole -- of which there was one
on each side of the hut.
Gabriel had always known that when the fire was
lighted and the door closed one of these must be kept
open -- that chosen being always on the side away from
the wind. Closing the slide to windward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turned to
open the other; on second -- thoughts the farmer con-
sidered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would first sit down leaving both
closed for a minute or two, till the temperature of the
hut was a little raised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sat down.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and,
fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of
the preceding nights, Oak decided to get up, open the
slide, and then allow himself to fall asleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fell
asleep, however, without having performed the necessary
preliminary.
How long he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) remained unconscious Gabriel never
knew. During the first stages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) return to percep-
tion peculiar deeds seemed to be in course of enactment.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) dog was howling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head was aching fearfully --
somebody was pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) about, hands were loosening
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) neckerchief.
On opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) found that evening had sunk
to dusk in a strange manner of unexpectedness. The
young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white
teeth was beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). More than this -- astonishingly
more -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lap, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face and neck
were disagreeably wet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers were unbuttoning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) collar.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, vacantly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignifi-
cant a kind to start enjoyment.
``Nothing now', she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, ``since you are not
dead It is a wonder you were not,suffocated in this
hut of yours.''
``Ah, the hut!'' murmured Gabriel. ``I gave ten
pounds for that hut. But I'll sell it, and sit under
thatched hurdles as they did in old times, curl up
to sleep in a lock of straw! It played me nearly the
same trick the other day!'' Gabriel, by way of emphasis,
brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) fist upon the floor.
``It was not exactly the fault of the hut.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ob-
served in a tone which showed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be that novelty
among women -- one who finished a thought before
beginning the sentence which was to convey it. ``You
should I think, have considered, and not have been so
foolish as to leave the slides closed.''
``Yes I suppose I should.'' said Oak, absently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
was endeavouring to catch and appreciate the sensation
of being thus with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dress, before
the event passed on into the heap of bygone things.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) impressions; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would as
soon have thought of carrying an odour in a net as of
attempting to convey the intangibilities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) feeling
in the coarse meshes of language. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) remained
silent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sit up, and then Oak began wiping
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) face and shaking himself like a Samson. ``How
can I thank `ee?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said at last, gratefully, some of the
natural rusty red having returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) face. ``Oh, never mind that.''
said the girl, smiling, and
allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smile to hold good for Gabriel's next
remark, whatever that might prove to be.
``How did you find me?''
``I heard your dog howling and scratching at the
door of the hut when I came to the milking -LRB-it was so
lucky, Daisy's milking is almost over for the season, and
I shall not come here after this week or the next-RRB-. The
dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of
my skirt. I came across and looked round the hut the
very first thing to see if the slides were closed. My
uncle has a hut like this one, and I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) tell
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide
open. I opened the door, and there you were like
dead. I threw the milk over you, as there was no
water, forgetting it was warm, and no use.''
``I wonder if I should have died?'' Gabriel said, in a
low voice, which was rather meant to travel back to
himself than to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
``O no,'' the girl replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to prefer a
less tragic probability; to have saved a man from death
involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of
such a deed -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shunned it.
``I believe you saved my life, Miss -- -- I don't know
your name. I know your aunt's, but not yours.''
``I would just as soon not tell it -- rather not. There
is no reason either why I should, as you probably will
never have much to do with me.'' ``Still, I should like to know.''
``You can inquire at my aunt's -- she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) will tell you.''
``My name is Gabriel Oak.''
``And mine isn't. You seem fond of yours in
speaking it so decisively, Gabriel Oak.''
``You see, it is the only one I shall ever have, and I
must make the most of it.''
``I always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable.''
``I should think you might soon get a new one.''
``Mercy! -- how many opinions you keep about you
concerning other people, Gabriel Oak.''
``Well Miss-excuse the words-I thought you
would like them But I can't match you I know in
napping out my mind upon my tongue. I never was
very clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come
give me your hand!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak's old-
fashioned earnest conclusion. to a dialogue lightly
carried on.``Very well.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hand, compressing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips to a demure impassivity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) held it but an instant, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fear of being too
demonstrative, swerved to the opposite extreme, touching
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fingers with the lightness of a small-hearted person.
``I am sorry.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said, the instant after.
``What for?''
``You may have it again if you like; there it is.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand again.
Oak held it longer this time -- indeed, curiously long.
``How soft it is -- being winter time, too -- not chapped
or rough or anything!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said.
``There -- that's long enough.'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), though with-
out pulling it away ``But I suppose you are thinking
you would like to kiss it? You may if you want to.''
``I wasn't thinking of any such thing.'' said Gabriel,
simply; ``but I will''
``That you won't!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) snatched back her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.
<div class="bookquote">``Now find out my name.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, teasingly; and
withdrew.




<p/>CHAPTER IV



<p/>GABRIEL``S RESOLVE -- THE VISIT -- THE MISTAKE


<p/>THE only superiority in women that is tolerable to the
rival sex is, as a rule, that of the unconscious kind; but
a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes
please by suggesting possibilities of capture to the
subordinated man.
This well-favoured and comely girl soon made appre-
ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young
Farmer Oak.
Love, being an extremely exacting usurer -LRB-a sense of
exorbitant profit, spiritually, by an exchange of hearts,
being at the bottom of pure passions, as that of exorbi-
tant profit, bodily or materially, is at the bottom of
those of lower atmosphere-RRB-, every morning Oak's feelings
were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) chances. His (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) dog waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) meals in a
way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl's
presence, that the farmer was quite struck with the
resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at the
dog. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) continued to watch through the
hedge for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) regular coming, and thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) sentiments
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were deepened without any corresponding
effect being produced upon herself. Oak had nothing
finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able
to frame love phrases which end where they begin;
passionate tales --
-- Full of sound and fury
-- signifying nothing --
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said no word at all.
By making inquiries he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) found that the girl's name
was Bathsheba Everdene, and that the cow would go
dry in about seven days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) dreaded the eight day.
At last the eighth day came. The cow had ceased
to give milk for that year, and Bathsheba Everdene
came up the hill no more. Gabriel had reached a
pitch of existence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) never could have anticipated a
short time before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) liked saying `Bathsheba' as a
private enjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
taste to black hair, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had sworn by brown ever
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was a boy, isolated himself till the space he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
filled in a possible strength in an actual weakness. Marriage
transforms a distraction into a support, the power of
which should be, and happily often is, in direct pro-
portion to the degree of imbecility it supplants. Oak
began now to see light in this direction, and said to
himself, <div class="bookquote">``I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) my wife, or upon my soul I shall
be good for nothing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All this while he (<font color='blue'><b>GABRIEL</b></font>) was perplexing himself about an
errand on which he (<font color='blue'><b>GABRIEL</b></font>) might consistently visit the cottage
of Bathsheba's aunt.
He (<font color='blue'><b>GABRIEL</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>GABRIEL</b></font>) opportunity in the death of a ewe,
mother of a living lamb. On a day which had a
summer face and a winter constitution-a fine January
morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible to
make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an
occasional gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb
into a respectable Sunday basket, and stalked across the
fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the aunt -- George,
the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great
concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be
taking.
Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling
from the chimney with strange meditation. At evening
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had fancifully traced it down the chimney to the
spot of its origin -- seen the hearth and Bathsheba
beside it -- beside it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) out-door dress; for the
clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) had worn on the hill were by association
equally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) person included in the compass of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
affection; they seemed at this early time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) love a
necessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bath-
sheba Everdene.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind -- of a
nature between the carefully neat and the carelessly
ornate -- of a degree between fine-market-day and wet-
Sunday selection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) thoroughly cleaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) silver
watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
boots, looked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the
inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick,
and trimmed it vigorously on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) way back; took a new
handkerchief from the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) clothes-box, put
on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs
of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose
and lily without the defects of either, and used all the
hair-oil he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) possessed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) usually dry, sandy, and
inextricably curly hair, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had deepened it to a
splendidly novel colour, between that of guano and
Roman cement, making it stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head like mace
round a nutmeg, or wet seaweed round a boulder after
the ebb.
Nothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save
the chatter of a knot of sparrows on the eaves; one
might fancy scandal and rumour to be no less the
staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of
those under them. It seemed that the omen was an
unpropitious one, for, as the rather untoward commence-
ment of Oak's overtures, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arrived by the garden
gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw a cat inside, going into various arched shapes
and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) dog George.
The dog took no notice , for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had arrived at an age
at which all superfluous barking was cynically avoided
as a waste of breath -- in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) never barked even
at the sheep except to order, when it was done with
an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Com-
mination-service, which, though offensive, had to be
gone through once now and then to frighten the flock
for their own good.
A voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into
which the cat had run:
<div class="bookquote">``Poor dear! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to
kill it; -- did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) poor dear!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the cat</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak to the voice, <div class="bookquote">``but
George was walking on behind me with a temper as
mild as milk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Almost before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had ceased speaking, Oak was
seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) answer. Nobody appeared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) heard the
person retreat among the bushes.
Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brought
small furrows into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forehead by sheer force of
reverie. Where the issue of an interview is as likely
to be a vast change for the worse as for the better,
any initial difference from expectation causes nipping
sensations of failure. Oak went up to the door a little
abashed: his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mental rehearsal and the reality had had
no common grounds of opening.
Bathsheba's aunt was indoors. <div class="bookquote">``Will you tell Miss
Everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Oak</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Oak. -LRB-Calling one's self merely Some-
body, without giving a name, is not to be taken as
an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it
springs from a refined modesty, of which townspeople,
with their cards and announcements, have no notion
whatever.-RRB-
Bathsheba was out. The voice had evidently been
hers.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you come in, Mr. Oak?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Oh, thank `ee, said Gabriel, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to the
fireplace. ``I've brought a lamb for Miss Everdene.
I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might like one to rear; girls do.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might.<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)'s only a visitor here. If you will wait a minute,
Bathsheba will be in.''
``Yes, I will wait.'' said Gabriel, sitting down. ``The
lamb isn't really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.
In short, I was going to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)'d like to be
married.''
``And were you indeed?''
``Yes. Because if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) would, I should be very glad
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>). D'ye know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)'s got any other young
man hanging about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) at all?''
``Let me think,'' said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire
superfluously... ``Yes -- bless you, ever so many young
men. You see, Farmer Oak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)'s so good-looking, and
an excellent scholar besides -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was going to be a
governess once, you know, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was too wild. Not
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) young men ever come here -- but, Lord, in the
nature of women, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) must have a dozen!''
``That's unfortunate.'' said Farmer Oak, contemplating
a crack in the stone floor with sorrow. ``I'm only an
every-day sort of man, and my only chance was in being
the first comer... , Well, there's no use in my waiting,
for that was all I came about: so I'll take myself off
home-along, Mrs. Hurst.''
When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the
down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heard a ``hoi-hoi!'' uttered behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), in a piping note of more treble quality than that
in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when
shouted across a field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) looked round, and saw a girl
racing after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), waving a white handkerchief.
Oak stood still -- and the runner drew nearer. It was
Bathsheba Everdene. Gabriel's colour deepened: hers
was already deep, not, as it appeared, from emotion,
but from running.
``Farmer Oak -- I -- '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, pausing for want of
breath pulling up in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) with a slanted face
and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side.
``I have just called to see you,'' said Gabriel, pending
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) further speech.
``Yes-I know that!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said panting like a robin,
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face red and moist from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exertions, like a peony
petal before the sun dries off the dew. ``I didn't know
you had come to ask to have me, or I should have come
in from the garden instantly. I ran after you to say --
that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from
courting me -- -- -- ''
Gabriel expanded.``I'm sorry to have made you
run so fast, my dear.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, with a grateful sense of
favours to come. ``Wait a bit till you've found your
breath.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-- It was quite a mistake-aunt's telling you I had
a young man <div class="bookquote">``already.'' (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>- Bathsheba went on. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't
a sweetheart at all -- and I never had one, and I thought
that, as times go with women, it was such a pity to send
you away thinking that I had several.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really and truly I am glad to hear that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Farmer Oak</b></font>)</div>said
Farmer Oak, smiling one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) long special smiles, and
blushing with gladness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) hand to take
hers, which, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had eased her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side by pressing
it there, was prettily extended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom to still
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loud-beating heart. Directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) seized it she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put
it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), so that it slipped through his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fingers like
an eel. ''
``I have a nice snug little farm.'' said Gabriel, with
half a degree less assurance than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
``Yes; you have.''
``A man has advanced me money to begin with, but
still, it will soon be paid off and though I am only an
every-day sort of man, I have got on a little since I was
a boy.'' Gabriel uttered ``a little'' in a tone to-show
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that it was the complacent form of ``a great deal.<div class="bookquote">''
e continued: ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When we be married, I am quite sure
I can work twice as hard as I do now.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went forward and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm again.
Bathsheba had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) at a point beside which
stood a low stunted holly bush, now laden with red
berries. Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>) advance take the form of an attitude
threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) person, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) edged off round the bush.
``Why, Farmer Oak.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, over the top, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>bush</b></font>) with rounded eyes, ``I never said I was going to
marry you.''
``Well -- that is a tale!<div class="bookquote">'' said Oak, with dismay.''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>To
run after anybody like this, and then say you don't
want him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)!''
``What I meant to tell you was only this.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said
eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the
position she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had made for herself -- ``that nobody has
got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my having a
dozen, as my aunt said; I hate to be thought men's
property in that way, though possibly I shall be had
some day. Why, if I'd wanted you I shouldn't have
run after you like this; `twould have been the forwardest
thing! But there was no harm in `hurrying to correct
a piece of false news that had been told you.''
``Oh, no -- no harm at all.'' But there is such a thing
as being too generous in expressing a judgment impuls-
ively, and Oak added with a more appreciative sense
of all the circumstances -- ``Well, I am not quite certain
it was no harm.''
``Indeed, I hadn't time to think before starting
whether I wanted to marry or not, for you'd have been
gone over the hill.''
``Come.'' said Gabriel, freshening again; ``think a
minute or two. I'll wait a while, Miss Everdene. Will
you marry me? Do, Bathsheba. I love you far more
than common!''
``I'll try to think.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) observed, rather more timor-
ously; ``if I can think out of doors; my mind spreads
away so.''
``But you can give a guess.''
``Then give me time.'' Bathsheba looked thought-
fully into the distance, away from the direction in which
Gabriel stood.
``I can make you happy,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
head, across the bush. ``You shall have as piano in a
year or two -- farmers' wives are getting to have pianos
now -- and I'll practise up the flute right well to play
with you in the evenings.''
``Yes; I should like that.''
``And have one of those little ten-pound<div class="bookquote">'' gigs for
market -- and nice flowers, and birds -- cocks and hens
I mean, because they be useful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>continued Gabriel,
feeling balanced between poetry and practicality.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And a frame for cucumbers -- like a gentleman and
lady.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes.''
``And when the wedding was over, we'd have it put
in the newspaper list of marriages.''
``Dearly I should like that!''
``And the babies in the births -- every man jack of
<div class="bookquote">``em! And at home by the fire, whenever you look up,
there I shall be -- and whenever I look up there will
be you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait wait and don't be improper!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) countenance fell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was silent awhile.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) regarded the red berries between them over and
over again, to such an extent, that holly seemed in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
marriage. Bathsheba decisively turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`tis no use.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. ``I don't want to marry
you.''
``Try.''
``I have tried hard all the time I've been thinking;
for a marriage would be very nice in one sense.
People would talk about me, and think I had won my
battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all that,
But a husband -- -- --
<div class="bookquote">``Well!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a husband</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d always be there, as you say; whenever
I looked up, there he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would -- I, that is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being
a bride at a wedding, if I could be one without having
a husband. But since a woman can't show off in that
way by herself, I shan't marry -- at least yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a terrible wooden story.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>At this criticism of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) statement Bathsheba made
an addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dignity by a slight sweep away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what a
maid can say stupider than that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak. <div class="bookquote">``But
dearest.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) continued in a palliative voice, <div class="bookquote">``don't be
like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Oak sighed a deep honest sigh -- none the
less so in that, being like the sigh of a pine plantation,
it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo-
sphere. <div class="bookquote">``Why won't you have me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) appealed,
creeping round the holly to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side.
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, retreating.
<div class="bookquote">``But why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) persisted, standing still at last in
despair of ever reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and facing over the
bush.
<div class="bookquote">``Because I don't love you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness,
so that it was hardly ill-mannered at all. <div class="bookquote">``I don't love
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.''
``But I love you -- and, as for myself, I am content
to be liked.''
``O Mr. Oak -- that's very fine! You'd get to despise me.''
``Never.'' said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) seemed
to be coming, by the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) words, straight
through the bush and into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms. ``I shall do one
thing in this life -- one thing certain -- that is, love you,
and long for you, and keep wanting you till I die.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)
voice had a genuine pathos now, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) large brown
hands perceptibly trembled.
``It seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when
you feel so much!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said with a little distress, and
looking hopelessly around for some means of escape
from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) moral dilemma. ``H-LRB-ow I wish I hadn't run
after you!'' However she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to have a short cut
for getting back to cheerfulness, and set her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face to
signify archness. ``It wouldn't do, Mr Oak. I want
somebody to tame me; I am too independent; and
you would never be able to, I know.''
Oak cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) eyes down the field in a way implying
that it was useless to attempt argument.
``Mr. Oak.<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, with luminous distinctness and
common sense, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Oak</b></font>)</div>you are better off than I. I have
hardly a penny in the world -- I am staying with my
aunt for my bare sustenance. I am better educated
than you -- and I don't love you a bit: that's my side
of the case. Now yours: you are a farmer just begin-
ing; and you ought in common prudence, if you marry
at all -LRB-which you should certainly not think of doing
at present-RRB- to marry a woman with money, who would

<div class="bookquote">``That's the very thing I had been thinking myself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) naively said.
Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian character-
istics too many to succeed with Bathsheba: his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) humility,
and a superfluous moiety of honesty. Bathsheba was
decidedly disconcerted,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, why did you come and disturb me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, almost angrily, if not quite, an enlarging red

<div class="bookquote">``I can't do what I think would be -- would be -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Right?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No: wise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have made an admission now, Mr. Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
exclaimed, with even more hauteur, and rocking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``After that, do you think I could
marry you? Not if I know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) broke in passionately. <div class="bookquote">``But don't mistake me
like that! Because I am open enough to own what

notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury is, I have
heerd, a large farmer -- much larger than ever I shall
be. May I call in the evening, or will you walk along

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- no -- I cannot. Don't press me any more --

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said, with a laugh.

 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V



<p/>DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA -- A PASTORAL TRAGEDY


<p/>THE news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bath-
sheba Everdene had left the neighbourhood, had an
influence upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) which might have surprised any
who never suspected that the more emphatic the renun-
ciation the less absolute its character.
It may have been observed that there is no regula
path for getting out of love as there is for getting in.
Some people look upon marriage as a short cut that way,
but it has been known to fail. Separation, which was
the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by
Bathsheba's disappearance though effectual with people
of certain humours is apt to idealise the removed object
with others -- notably those whose affection, placid and
regular as it may be flows deep and long. Oak belonged
to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the
secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with
a finer flame now that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was gone -- that was all.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) incipient friendship with her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) aunt-had been
nipped by the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) suit, and all that Oak learnt
of Bathsheba's movements was done indirectly. It ap-
peared that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) had gone to a place called Weatherbury,
more than twenty miles off, but in what capacity --
whether as a visitor, or permanently, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not
discover.
Gabriel had two dogs. George, the elder, exhibited
an ebony-tipped nose, surrounded by a narrow margin
of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches
approximating in colour to white and slaty grey; but the
grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and
washed out of the more prominent locks, leaving them
of a reddish-brown, as if the blue component of the grey
had faded, like the indigo from the same kind of colour in
Turner's pictures. In substance it had originally been
hair, but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning
it by degrees into wool of a poor quality and staple.
This dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of
inferior morals and dreadful temper, and the result was
that George knew the exact degrees of condemnation
signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions
better than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood.
Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the
difference between such exclamations as <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``D -- -- ye, come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew to a hair's
breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes' tails
that each call involved, if a staggerer with the sheep
crook was to be escaped. Though old, he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) was clever
and trustworthy still.
The young dog, George's son, might possibly have
been the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, for there was not much
resemblance between him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and George. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was learn-
ing the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow on at
the flock when the other should die, but had got no
further than the rudiments as yet -- still finding an
insuperable difficulty in distinguishing between doing a
thing well enough and doing it too well. So earnest
and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had no,
name in particular, and answered with perfect readiness
to any pleasant interjection-RRB-, that if sent behind the
flock to help them on, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did it so thoroughly that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
would have chased them across the whole county with
the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when
to step by the example of old George.
Thus much for the dogs. On the further side of
Norcombe Hill was a chalk-pit, from which chalk had
been drawn for generations, and spread over adjacent
farms. Two hedges converged upon it in the form of
a V, but without quite meeting. The narrow opening
left, which was immediately over the brow of the pit,
was protected by a rough railing.
One night, when Farmer Oak had returned to, his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
house, believing there would be no further necessity for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) attendance on the down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) called as usual to the
dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse till
next morning. Only one responded -- old George; the
other-could not be found, either in the house, lane, or
garden. - Gabriel then remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had left the
two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb -LRB-a kind of meat
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) usually kept from them, except when other food-ran
finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) meal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went indoors to the luxury of a bed,
which latterly he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had only enjoyed on Sundays.
It was a still, moist night. Just before dawn he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was
assisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of
familiar music. To the shepherd, the note of the sheep''
chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing
ever distant, that all is well in the fold. In the solemn
This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways --
by the rapid feeding of the sheep bearing the bell, as
when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it
an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off in
a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation. The
experienced ear of Oak knew the sound he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) now heard
to be caused by the running of the flock with great
velocity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane
through a foggy dawn, and ascended the hill. The
forward ewes were kept apart from those among which
the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred
of the latter class in Gabriel's flock. These two hundred
seemed to have absolutely vanished from the hill. There
were the fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had left them, but the rest, forming the bulk of
the flock, were nowhere. Gabriel called at the top of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice the shepherd's call.
``Ovey, ovey, ovey!''
Not a single bleat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went to the hedge -- a gap
had been broken through it, and in the gap were the
footprints of the sheep. Rather surprised to find
them break fence at this season, yet putting it down
instantly to their great fondness for ivy in winter-time,
of which a great deal grew in the plantation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) followed
through the hedge. They were not in the plantation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) called again: the valleys and farthest hills resounded
as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian
shore; but no sheep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) passed through the trees and
along the ridge of the hill. On the extreme summit,
where the ends of the two converging hedges of which
we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow
of the chalk-pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw the younger dog standing against
the sky -- dark and motionless as Napoleon at St.
Helena.
A horrible conviction darted through Oak. With
a sensation of bodily faintness he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) advanced: at one
point the rails were broken through, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) saw
the footprints of his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) ewes. The dog came up, licked
his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) hand, and made signs implying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) expected
some great reward for signal services rendered. Oak
looked over the precipice. The ewes lay dead and dying
at its foot -- a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses,
representing in their condition just now at least two
hundred more.
Oak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which bordered on strategy, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on as
by gravitation. A shadow in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life had always been
that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flock ended in mutton -- that a day came and
found every shepherd an arrant traitor to his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) defenseless
sheep. His (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) first feeling now was one of pity for the
untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn
lambs.
It was a second to remember another phase of the
matter. The sheep were not insured. All the savings
of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow; his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hopes
of being an independent farmer were laid low -- possibly
for ever. Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had
been so severely taxed during the years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life between
eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) present stage
of progress that no more seemed to be left in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
hands.
Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer
Oak recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>). It was as remarkable as it was
characteristic that the one sentence he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) uttered was in
thankfulness: --
<div class="bookquote">``Thank God I am not married: what would she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) have
done in the poverty now coming upon me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) head, and wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) could
do listlessly surveyed the scene. By the outer margin
of the Pit was an oval pond, and over it hung the
attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which
had only a few days to last -- the morning star dogging
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) on the left hand. The pool glittered like a dead
man's eye, and as the world awoke a breeze blew,
shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon
without breaking it, and turning the image of the star
to a phosphoric streak upon the water. All this Oak
saw and remembered.
As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor
young dog, still under the impression that since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
kept for running after sheep, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran after
them the better, had at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meal off the
dead lamb, which may have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) additional energy
and spirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven
the timid creatures through the hedge, across the upper
field, and by main force of worrying had given them
momentum enough to break down a portion of the
rotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.
George's son had done his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) work so thoroughly that
he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was considered too good a workman to live, and was,
in fact, taken and tragically shot at twelve o'clock that
same day -- another instance of the untoward fate which
so often attends dogs and other philosophers who
follow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion,
and attempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world
made up so largely of compromise.
Gabriel's farm had been stocked by a dealer -- on the
strength of Oak's promising look and character -- who
was receiving a percentage from the farmer till such
time as the advance should be cleared off Oak found-
that the value of stock, plant, and implements which
were really his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own would be about sufficient to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
debts, leaving himself a free man with the clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
stood up in, and nothing more.




<p/>CHAPTER VI



<p/>THE FAIR -- THE JOURNEY -- THE FIRE


<p/>TWO months passed away. We are brought on to a
day in February, on which was held the yearly statute
or hiring fair in the county-town of Casterbridge.
At one end of the street stood from two to three
hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance
-- all men of the stamp to whom labour suggests nothing
worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and pleasure
nothing better than a renunciation of the same among
these, carters and waggoners were distinguished by
having a piece of whip-cord twisted round their hats;
thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw; shepherds
held their sheep-crooks in their hands; and thus the
situation required was known to the hirers at a
glance.
In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of some-
what superior appearance to the rest -- in fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
superiority was marked enough to lead several ruddy
peasants standing by to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) inquiringly, as to
a farmer, and to use `Sir' as a finishing word. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
answer always was,
<div class="bookquote">``I am looking for a place myself -- a bailiff's. Do
Ye know of anybody who wants one?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel was paler now. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes were more medi-
tative, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) expression was more sad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) more than it had taken away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had sunk
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) modest elevation as pastoral king into the very
slime-pits of Siddim; but there was left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a digni-
fied calm he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had never before known, and that indiffer-
ence to fate which, though it often makes a villain of
a man, is the basis of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sublimity when it does not.
And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the
loss gain.
In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the
town, and a sergeant and his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) party had been beating up
for recruits through the four streets. As the end of the
day drew on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) found himself not hired, Gabriel
almost wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had joined them, and gone off to
serve his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) country. Weary of standing in the market-
place, and not much minding the kind of work he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) decided to offer himself in some
other capacity than that of bailiff.
All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds.
Sheep-tending was Gabriel's speciality. Turning down
an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went
up to a smith's shop.
<div class="bookquote">``How long would it take you to make a shepherd's
crook?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Twenty minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two shillings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem
being given him (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) into the bargain.
He (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) then went to a ready-made clothes' shop, the
owner of which had a large rural connection. As the
crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat
for a shepherd's regulation smock-frock.
This transaction having been completed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) again
hurried off to the centre of the town, and stood on the
kerb of the pavement, as a shepherd, crook in hand.
Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it
seemed that bailifs were most in demand. However, two
or three farmers noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) and drew near. Dialogues
followed, more or lessin the subjoined for: --
<div class="bookquote">``Where do you come from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Norcombe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``That's a long way.
``Fifteen miles.''
``Who's farm were you upon last?''
``My own.''
This reply invariably operated like a rumour of
cholera. The inquiring farmer would edge away and
shake his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head dubiously. Gabriel, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) dog, was
too good to be trustworthy,. and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) never made advance
beyond this point.
It is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and
extemporize a procedure to fit it, than to get a good
shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the
whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair. It
grew dusk. Some merry men were whistling and
singing by the corn-exchange. Gabriel's hand, which
had lain for some time idle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) smock-frock pocket,
touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) flute which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) carried there. Here was
an opportunity for putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) dearly bought wisdom
into practice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) flute and began to play ``Jockey to
the Fair'' in the style of a man who had never known
moment's sorrow. Oak could pipe with Arcadian
sweetness and the sound of the well-known notes
cheered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own heart as well as those of the loungers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) played on with spirit, and in half an hour had
earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute
man.
By making inquiries he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learnt that there was another
fair at Shottsford the next day.
``How far is Shottsford?''
``Ten miles t`other side of Weatherbury.''
Weatherbury! It was where Bathsheba had gone
two months before. This information was like coming
from night into noon.
``How far is it to Weatherbury?''
``Five or six miles.''
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
this time, but the place had enough interest attaching
to it to lead Oak to choose Shottsford fair as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next
field of inquiry, because it lay in the Weatherbury
quarter. Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no
means uninteresting intrinsically. If report spoke truly
they were as hardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set as
any in the whole county. Oak resolved to sleep at
Weatherbury -- that -- night on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to Shottsford,
and struck out at once -- into the -- high road which had
been recommended as the direct route to the village in
question.
The road stretched through water-meadows traversed
by little brooks, whose quivering surfaces were braided
along their centres, and folded into creases at the sides;
or, where the flow was more rapid, the stream was pied
with spots of white froth, which rode on in undisturbed
serenity. On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses
of leaves tapped the ground as they bowled along helter-
skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and little birds
in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking
themselves in comfortably for the night, retaining their
places if Oak kept moving, but flying away if he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
stopped to look at them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) passed by Yalbury-Wood
where the game-birds were rising to their roosts, and
heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants ``cu-uck, cuck,''
and the wheezy whistle of the hens.
By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had walked three or four miles every
shape in the-landscape had assumed a uniform hue of
blackness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) descended Yalbury Hill and could just
discern ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) a waggon, drawn up under a great
over-hanging tree by the roadside.
On coming close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) found there were no horses
attached to it, the spot being apparently quite deserted.
The waggon, from its position, seemed to have been left
there for the night, for beyond about half a truss of hay
which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty.
Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and con-
sidered his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) calculated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had walked
a very fair proportion of the journey; and having been
on foot since daybreak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) felt tempted to lie down upon
the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the
village of Weatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.
Eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) las slices of bread and ham, and drinking
from the bottle of cider he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had taken the precaution to
bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) got into the lonely waggon. Here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
could in the darkness, pulled the other half over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
by way of bed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and
feeling, physically, as comfortable as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life. Inward melancholy it was impossible for
a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) neighbours,
to banish quite, whilst conning the present. untoward
page of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) history. So, thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) misfortunes,
amorous and pastoral he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fell asleep, shepherds enjoying,
in common with sailors, the privilege of being able to
summon the god instead of having to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>).
On somewhat suddenly awaking after a sleep of
whose length he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had no idea, Oak found that the waggon
was in motion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was being carried along the road
at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without
springs, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) head being dandled up and down on the bed of
the waggon like a kettledrum-stick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) then dis-
tinguished voices in conversation, coming from the
forpart of the waggon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) concern at this dilemma
-LRB-which would have been alarm, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) been a thriving
man; but -- misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror-RRB-
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) to peer cautiously from the hay, and the first
sight he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) beheld was the stars above him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>). Charles's
Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole
star, and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine
o'clock -- in other words, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had slept two hours.
This small astronomical calculation was made without
any positive effort, and whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was stealthily turning
to discover, if possible, into whose hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had fallen.
Two figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with
their legs outside the waggon, one of whom was driving.
Gabriel soon found that this was the waggoner, and it
appeared they had come from Casterbridge fair, like
himself.
A conversation was in progress, which continued
thus: --
``Be as `twill, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a fine handsome body as far's
looks be concerned. But that's only the skin of the
woman, and these dandy cattle be as-proud as a lucifer
in their insides.''
``Ay -- so 'a do seem, Billy Smallbury -- so 'a do seem.''
This utterance was very shaky by nature, and more so
by circumstance, the jolting of the waggon not being-
without its effect upon the speaker's larynx. It came
``from the man who held the reins.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a very vain feymell -- so `tis said here and
there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, now. If so be `tis like that, I can't look her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
the face. Lord, no: not I -- heh-heh-heh! Such a shy
man as I be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s very vain. ``Tis said that every night at
going to bed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks in the glass to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) night-
cap properly.''
``And not a married woman. Oh, the world!''
``And 'a can play the peanner, so `tis said. Can
play so clever that 'a can make a psalm tune sound as
well as the merriest loose song a man can wish for.''
``D'ye tell o`t! A happy time for us, and I feel quite
a new man! And how do she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) play?''
``That I don't know, Master Poorgrass.''
On hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild
thought flashed into Gabriel's mind that they might
be speaking of Bathsheba. There were, however, no
ground for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon,
though going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be
going beyond it, and the woman alluded to seemed to be
the mistress of some estate. They were now apparently
close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers
unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turned to an opening in the hedge, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
found to be a gate, and mounting thereon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sat
meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in the
village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under
some hay or corn-stack. The crunching jangle of the
waggon died upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was about to walk on,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) noticed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) left hand an unusual light --
appearing about half a mile distant. Oak watched it,
and the glow increased. Something was on fire.
Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down
on the other side upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) found to be ploughed
soil, made across the field in the exact direction of the
fire. The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
approach and its own increase, showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) drew
nearer the outlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great
distinctness. A rick-yard was the source of the fire.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) weary face now began to be painted over with a
rich orange glow, and the whole front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) smock-
frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow
pattern of thorn-twigs -- the light reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) through
a leafless intervening hedge -- and the metallic curve of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sheep-crook shone silver-bright in the same abound-
ing rays. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) came up to the boundary fence, and
stood to regain breath. It seemed as if the spot was
unoccupied by a living soul.
The fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which
was so far gone as to preclude a possibility of saving it.
A rick burns differently from a house. As the wind
blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames completely
disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is lost
to the eye. However, a hay or a wheat-rick, well put
together, will resist combustion for a length of time, if
it begins on the outside.
This before Gabriel's eyes was a- rick of straw, loosely
put together, and the flames darted into it with lightning
swiftness. It glowed on the windward side, rising and
falling in intensity, like the coal of a cigar. Then a
superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking
noise; flames elongated, and bent themselves about
with a quiet roar, but no crackle. Banks of smoke
went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds,
and behind these burned hidden pyres, illuminating
the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow
uniformity. Individual straws in the foreground were
consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat, as
if they were knots of red worms, and above shone
imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring
eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals
sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest,
Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator
by discovering the case to be more serious than he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had
at first imagined. A scroll of smoke blew aside and
revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition
with the decaying one, and behind this a series of
others, composing the main corn produce of the farm;
so that instead of the straw-stack standing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had
imagined comparatively isolated, there was a regular
connection between it and the remaining stacks of the
group.
Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was
not alone. The first man he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) came to was running
about in a great hurry, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) thoughts were several
yards in advance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) body, which they could never
drag on fast enough.
``O, man -- fire, fire! A good master and a. bad
servant is fire, fire! -- I mane a bad servant and a good
master O, Mark Clark -- come! And you, Billy
Smallbury -- and you, Maryann Money -- and you, Jan
Coggan, and Matthew there!'' Other figures now
appeared behind this shouting man and among the
smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from being alone
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was in a great company -- whose shadows danced
merrily up and down, timed by the jigging of the
flames, and not at all by their owners' movements.
The assemblage -- belonging to that class of society
which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling, and
its feelings into the form of commotion -- set to work
with a remarkable confusion of purpose.
``Stop the draught under the wheat-rick!'' cried
Gabriel to those nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). The corn stood on
stone staddles, and between these, tongues of yellow
hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully.
If the fire once got under this stack, all would be
lost.
``Get a tarpaulin -- quick!'' said Gabriel.
A rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a
curtain across the channel. The flames immediately
ceased to go under the bottom of the corn-stack, and
stood up vertical.
``Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the
cloth wet.'' said Gabriel again.
The flames, now driven upwards, began to attack
the angles of the huge roof covering the wheat-stack.
``A ladder.'' cried Gabriel.
``The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt
to a cinder.'' said a spectre-like form in the smoke.
Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
were going to engage in the operation of ``reed-drawing,''
and digging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) feet, and occasionally sticking in the
stem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sheep-crook, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) clambered up the beetling
face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) at once sat astride the very apex, and began
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had
lodged thereon, shouting to the others to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a
bough and a ladder, and some water.
Billy Smallbury -- one of the men who had been on
the waggon -- by this time had found a ladder, which
Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak upon the
thatch. The smoke at this corner was stifling, and
Clark, a nimble fellow, having been handed a bucket
of water, bathed Oak's face and sprinkled him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) generally,
whilst Gabriel, now with a long beech-bough in one
hand, in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) crook in the other, kept
sweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles.
On the ground the groups of villagers were still
occupied in doing all they could to keep down the
conflagration, which was not much. They were all
tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying
pattern. Round the corner of the largest stack, out
of the direct rays of the fire, stood a pony, bearing a
young woman on its back. By her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side was another
woman, on foot. These two seemed to keep at a
distance from the fire, that the horse might not become
restive.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)'s a shepherd.'' said the woman on foot. ``Yes --
he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is. See how his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) crook shines as he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) beats the rick
with it. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) smock-frock is burnt in two holes, I
declare! A fine young shepherd he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) is too, ma'am.''
``Whose shepherd is he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)?'' said the equestrian in a
clear voice.
``Don't know, ma'am.'' ``Don't any of the others know?''
``Nobody at all -- I've asked 'em. Quite a stranger,
they say.''
The young woman on the pony rode out from the
shade and looked anxiously around.
``Do you think the barn is safe?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
``D'ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coggan?'' said
the second woman, passing on the question to the
nearest man in that direction.
``Safe -now -- leastwise I think so. If this rick had
gone the barn would have followed. <div class="bookquote">``Tis- that bold
shepherd up there that have done the most good -- he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) great long-arms
about like a windmill.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) does work hard.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the young woman on
horseback, looking up at Gabriel through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thick
woollen veil. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was shepherd here. Don't
any of you know his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never heard the man's name in my life, or seed
his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) form afore.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>The fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated
position being no longer required of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) made as
if to descend.
<div class="bookquote">``Maryann.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl on horseback, <div class="bookquote">``go to him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) comes down, and say that the farmer wishes to
thank him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) for the great service he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) has done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Maryann stalked off towards the rick and met
Oak at the foot of the ladder. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
message.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is your master the farmer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>asked Gabriel,
kindling with the idea of getting employment that
seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) now.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tisn't a master; `tis a mistress, shepherd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A woman farmer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, 'a b`lieve, and a rich one too!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a by-
stander. <div class="bookquote">``Lately 'a came here from a distance. Took
on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncle's farm, who died suddenly. Used to
measure his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) money in half-pint cups. They say now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ve business in every bank in Casterbridge, and
thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than
you and I, do pitch-halfpenny -- not a bit in the world,
shepherd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), back there upon the pony.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary-
ann. <div class="bookquote">``wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face a-covered up in that black cloth with
holes in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>crook</b></font>)</div>Oak, his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable
from the smoke and heat, his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) smock-frock burnt-into
holes and dripping with water, the ash stem of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sheep-
crook charred six inches shorter, advansed with the
humility stern adversity had thrust upon him (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) up to
the slight female form in the saddle. He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
hat with respect, and not without gallantry: stepping
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hanging feet he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) said in a hesitating voice, --
<div class="bookquote">``Do you happen to want a shepherd, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lifted the wool veil tied round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face, and
looked all astonishment. Gabriel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cold-hearted
darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to face.
Bathsheba did not speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mechanically
repeated in an abashed and sad voice, --
<div class="bookquote">``Do you want a shepherd, ma'am?''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VII



<p/>RECOGNITION -- A TIMID GIRL


<p/>BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade. She (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) scarcely
knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of
the meeting, or to be concerned at its awkwardness.
There was room for a little pity, also for a very little
exultation: the former at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) position, the latter at her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>)
own. Embarrassed she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) was not, and she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>)'' remembered
Gabriel's declaration of love to her (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) at Norcombe only
to think she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) had nearly forgotten it.
``Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>GIRL</b></font>) murmured, putting on an air of dignity,
and turning again to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) with a little warmth of cheek;
``I do want a shepherd. But -- -- ''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)'s the very man, ma'am.'' said one of the villagers,
quietly.
Conviction breeds conviction. ``Ay, that 'a is.'' said
a second, decisively.
``The man, truly!<div class="bookquote">'' said a third, with heartiness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s all there!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said number four, fervidly.''
Then will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to speak to the bailiff, said
Bathsheba.
All ``was practical again now. A summer eve and
loneliness would have been necessary to give the
meeting its proper fulness of romance.
the palpitation within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast at discovering that this
Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of
Venus the well-known and admired, retired with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.
The fire before them wasted away. <div class="bookquote">``Men.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said
Bathsheba, <div class="bookquote">'' you shall take a little refreshment after this
extra work. Will you come to the house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal
freer, Miss, if so be ye'd send it to Warren's Malthouse,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the spokesman</b></font>)</div>replied the spokesman.
Bathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and the
men straggled on to the village in twos and threes -- Oak
and the bailiff being left by the rick alone.
<div class="bookquote">``And now.''  (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div>said the bailiff, finally, <div class="bookquote">``all is settled, I
think, about your coming, and I am going home-along.
Good-night to ye, shepherd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bailiff</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you get me a lodging?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>inquired Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``That I can't, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, moving past Oak as
a Christian edges past an offertory-plate when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) does
not mean to contribute. <div class="bookquote">``If you follow on the road till
you come to Warren's Malthouse, where they are all
gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay some of
'em will tell you of a place. Good-night to ye, shepherd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The bailiff</b></font>)</div>The bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving
his (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) neighbour as himself, went up the hill, and Oak
walked on to the village, still astonished at the ren-
counter with Bathsheba, glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) nearness to her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>), and
perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl
of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cool
woman here. But some women only require an emerg-
ency to make them fit for one.
Obliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order
to find the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) reached the churchyard, and passed
round it under the wall where several ancient trees grew.
There was a wide margin of grass along here, and
Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even
at this indurating period of the year. When abreast of
a trunk which appeared to be the oldest of the old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
became aware that a figure was standing behind it.
Gabriel did not pause in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) walk, and in another
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise
was enough to disturb the motionless stranger, who
started and assumed a careless position.
It was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, heartily.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl to Gabriel.
The voice was unexpectedly attractive; it was <div class="bookquote">``the
low and dulcet note suggestive of romance,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>common in
descriptions, rare in experience.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll thank you to tell me if I'm in the way for
Warren's Malthouse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel resumed, primarily to gain
the information, indirectly to get more of the music.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite right. It's at the bottom of the hill. And
do you know -- --''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl hesitated and then went
on again. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know how late they keep open
the Buck's Head Inn?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed'' to be won by
Gabriel's heartiness, as Gabriel had been won by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
modulations.
``I don't know where the Buck's Head is, or anything
about it. Do you think of going there to-night?''
``Yes -- --'' The woman again paused. There was
no necessity for any continuance of speech, and the fact
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did add more seemed to proceed from an
unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a
remark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they
are acting by stealth. ``You are not a Weatherbury man?''
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, timorously.
``I am not. I am the new shepherd -- just arrived.''
``Only a shepherd -- and you seem almost a farmer by
your ways.''
``Only a shepherd.'' Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence
of finality. ``His (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) thoughts were directed to the past, his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
eyes to the feet of the girl; and for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)
saw lying there a bundle of some sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may have
perceived the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) face, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said
coaxingly, --
<div class="bookquote">``You won't say anything in the parish about having
seen me here, will you -- at least, not for a day or two?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't if you wish me not to.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the other replied.<div class="bookquote">``I am
rather poor, and I don't want people to know anything
about me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was silent and shivered.
<div class="bookquote">``You ought to have a cloak on such a cold night,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel observed. <div class="bookquote">``I would advise `ee to get indoors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no! Would you mind going on and leaving me?
I thank you much for what you have told me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will go on.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said; adding hesitatingly, -- <div class="bookquote">``Since
you are not very well off, perhaps you would accept this
trifle from me. It is only a shilling, but it is all I have
to spare.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will take it.''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, gratefully.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) extended her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand; Gabriel his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). In feeling for
each other's palm in the gloom before the money could
be passed, a minute incident occurred which told much.
Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young woman's wrist.
It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
frequently felt the same quick, hard beat in the femoral
artery of -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lambs when overdriven. It suggested a
consumption too great of a vitality which, to judge from
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure and stature, was already too little.
<div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But there is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no! Let your having seen me be a secret!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I will. Good-night, again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The young girl remained motionless by the tree, and
Gabriel descended into the village of Weatherbury, or
Lower Longpuddle as it was sometimes called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had felt himself in the penumbra of a
very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile
creature. But wisdom lies in moderating mere impres-
sions, and Gabriel endeavoured to think little of this.




<p/>CHAPTER VIII



<p/>THE MALTHOUSE -- THE CHAT -- NEWS


<p/>WARREN``S Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall
inwrapped with ivy, and though not much of the exterior
was visible at this hour, the character and purposes of
the building were clearly enough shown by its outline
upon the sky. From the walls an overhanging thatched
roof sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose
a small wooden lantern, fitted with louvre-boards on all
the four sides, and from these openings a mist was dimly
perceived to be escaping into the night air. There was
no window in front; but a square hole in the door was
glazed with a single pane, through which red, comfortable
rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front.
Voices were to be heard inside.
Oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with
fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Somerer pattern, till
he found a leathern strap, which he (<font color='blue'><b>he</b></font>) pulled. This lifted
a wooden latch, and the door swung open.
The room inside was lighted only by the, ruddy glow
from the kiln mouth, which shone over ,the floor with
the streaming, horizontality of the setting sun, and threw
upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those
assembled around. The stone-flag floor was worn into
a path from the doorway to the kiln, and into undula-
tions everywhere. A curved settle of unplaned oak
stretched along one side, and in a remote corner was a
small bed and bedstead, the owner and frequent occupier
of which was the maltster.
This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gnarled
figure like the grey moss and lichen upon a leafless
apple-tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore breeches and the laced-up shoes
called ankle-jacks; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the
fire.
Gabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden
with the sweet smell of new malt. The conversation
-LRB-which seemed to have been concerning the origin of the
fire-RRB- immediately ceased, and every one ocularly criticised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of
their foreheads and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) with narrowed eye-
lids, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been a light too strong for their sight.
Several exclaimed meditatively, after this operation had
been completed: --
``Oh, `tis the new shepherd, 'a b`lieve.''
``We thought we heard a hand pawing about the
door for the bobbin, but weren't sure `twere not a dead
leaf blowed across.'' said another. ``Come in, shepherd;
sure ye be welcome, though we don't know yer name.''
``Gabriel Oak, that's my name, neighbours.''
The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned up
this -- his (<font color='blue'><b>WARREN</b></font>) turning being as the turning of a rusty
crane.
``That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Nor-
combe -- never!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>WARREN</b></font>) said, as a formula expressive of
surprise, which nobody was supposed to take literally'.
``My father and my grandfather were old men of the
name of Gabriel.'' said the shepherd, placidly.
``Thought I knowed the man's face as I seed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
on the rick! -- thought I did! And where be ye trading
o't to now, shepherd?''
``I'm thinking of biding here.'' said Mr. Oak.
``Knowed yer grandfather for years and years!''
continued the maltster, the words coming forth of their
own accord as if the momentum previously imparted
had been sufficient.
``Ah -- and did you!''
``Knowed yer grandmother.''
``And her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) too!''
``Likewise knowed yer father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a child.
Why, my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn
brothers -- that they were sure -- weren't ye, Jacob?''
``Ay, sure.'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) son, a young man about sixty-
five, with a semi-bald head and one tooth in the left
centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) upper jaw, which made much of itself by
standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank. ``But
<div class="bookquote">``twas Joe had most to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). However, my son
William must have knowed the very man afore us --
didn't ye, Billy, afore ye left Norcombe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, 'twas Andrew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Jacob's son Billy, a child
of forty, or thereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity
of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy body, and
whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here
and there.
<div class="bookquote">``I can mind Andrew.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, <div class="bookquote">``as being a man in
the place when I was quite a child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay -- the other day I and my youngest daughter,
Liddy, were over at my grandson's christening.''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy Smallbury/Billy</b></font>)</div>continued
Billy. ``We were talking about this very family, and
``twas only last Purification Day in this very world, when
the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor
folk, you know, shepherd, and I can mind the day
because they all had to traypse up to the vestry -- yes,
this very man's family.''
``Come, shepherd, and drink. <div class="bookquote">``Tis gape and
swaller with us -- a drap of sommit, but not of much
account.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the maltster, removing from the fire his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing
into it for so many years. <div class="bookquote">``Take up the God-forgive-
me, Jacob. See if `tis warm, Jacob.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Jacob stooped to the God-forgive-me, which was a
two-handled tall mug standing in the ashes, cracked
and charred with heat: it was rather furred with ex-
traneous matter about the outside, especially in the
crevices of the handles, the innermost curves of which
may not have seen daylight for several years by reason
of this encrustation thereon -- formed of ashes accident-
ally wetted with cider and baked hard; but to the mind
of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that,
being incontestably clean on the inside and about the
rim. It may be observed that such a class of mug is
called a God-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity
for uncertain reasons; probably because its size makes
any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>drinker</b></font>) sees
its bottom in drinking it empty.
Jacob, on receiving the order to see if the liquor was
warm enough, placidly dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) forefinger into it by
way of thermometer, and having pronounced it nearly
of the proper degree, raised the cup and very civilly
attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom
with the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak
was a stranger.
<div class="bookquote">``A clane cup for the shepherd.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the maltster
commandingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No -- not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, in a reproving tone
of considerateness. <div class="bookquote">``I never fuss about dirt in its pure
state, and when I know what sort it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Taking the
mug he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) drank an inch or more from the depth of its
contents, and duly passed it to the next man.
wouldn't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in
washing up when there's so much work to be done in
the world already.'' continued Oak in a moister tone,
after recovering from the stoppage of breath which is
occasioned by pulls at large mugs.
``A right sensible man.'' said Jacob.
``True, true; it can't be gainsaid!'' observed a brisk
young man -- Mark Clark by name, a genial and pleasant
gentleman, whom to meet anywhere in your travels was
to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink with
was, unfortunately, to pay for.
``And here's a mouthful of bread and bacon that
mis`ess have sent, shepherd. The cider will go down
better with a bit of victuals. Don't ye chaw quite close,
shepherd, for I let the bacon fall in the road outside as
I was bringing it along, and may be `tis rather gritty.
There, `tis clane dirt; and we all know what that is,
as you say, and you bain't a particular man we see,
shepherd.''
``True, true -- not at all.'' said the friendly Oak.
``Don't let your teeth quite meet, and you won't feel
the sandiness at all. Ah! `tis wonderful what can be
done by contrivance!''
``My own mind exactly, neighbour.''
``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfer's own grandson! -- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandfer
were just such a nice unparticular man!'' said the maltster.
``Drink, Henry Fray -- drink.'' magnanimously said
Jan Coggan, a person who held Saint-Simonian notions
of share and share alike where liquor was concerned, as
the vessel showed signs of approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) in its gradual
revolution among them.
Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
gaze into mid-air, Henry did not refuse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a man
of more than middle age, with eyebrows high up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
forehead, who laid it down that the law of the world
was bad, with a long-suffering look through his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) listeners
at the world alluded to, as it presented itself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
imagination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) always signed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) name ``Henery'' --
strenuously insisting upon that spelling, and if any
passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second
``e'' was superfluous and old-fashioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) received the
reply that ``H-e-n-e-r-y'' was the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was christened
and the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would stick to -- in the tone of one
to whom orthographical differences were matters which
had a great deal to do with personal character.
Mr. Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery,
was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and
private glimmer in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, whose name had appeared
on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbour-
ing parishes as best man and chief witness in countless
unions of the previous twenty years; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) also very
frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms
of the subtly-jovial kind.
``Come, Mark Clark -- come. Ther's plenty more
in the barrel.'' said Jan.
``Ay -- that I will, `tis my only doctor.'' replied Mr.
Clark, who, twenty years younger than Jan Coggan,
revolved in the same orbit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) secreted mirth on all
occasions for special discharge at popular parties.
``Why, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!'' said
Mr. Coggan to a self-conscious man in the background,
thrusting the cup towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>).
``Such a modest man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!'' said Jacob Smallbury.
``Why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look
in our young mis`ess's face, so I hear, Joseph?''
All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.
``No -- I've hardly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) at all.'' simpered
Joseph, reducing his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) body smaller whilst talking,
apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence.
``And when I seed her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), 'twas nothing but blushes with
me!''
``Poor feller.<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Clark.
'' (<font color='red'><b>Poor feller</b></font>)</div>`Tis a curious nature for a man.'' said Jan Coggan.
``Yes.<div class="bookquote">'' continued Joseph Poorgrass -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) shyness,
which was so painful as a defect, filling him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) with a
mild complacency now that it was regarded as an
interesting study. '' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>`Twere blush, blush, blush with
me every minute of the time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) was speaking
to me.''
``I believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know ye
to be a very bashful man.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>`Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul.'' said the
maltster. ``And ye have suffered from it a long time,
we know.''
``Ay ever since I was a boy. Yes -- mother was
concerned to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart about it -- yes. But twas all
nought.''
``Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it,
Joseph Poorgrass?''
``Oh ay, tried all sorts o' company. They took me
to Greenhill Fair, and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble
show, where there were women-folk riding round --
standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their
smocks; but it didn't cure me a morsel. And then I
was put errand-man at the Women's Skittle Alley at the
back of the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge. <div class="bookquote">``Twas a
horrible sinful situation, and a very curious place for a
good man. I had to stand and look ba`dy people in
the face from morning till night; but 'twas no use -- I
was just as-bad as ever after all. Blushes hev been
in the family for generations. There, `tis a happy pro-
vidence that I be no worse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Jacob Smallbury, deepening his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) thoughts
to a profounder view of the subject. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis a thought
to look at, that ye might have been worse; but even
as you be, `tis a very bad affliction for `ee, Joseph. For
ye see, shepherd, though `tis very well for a woman,
dang it all, `tis awkward for a man like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), poor
feller?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis -- `tis.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, recovering from a medita-
tion. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, very awkward for the man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s very timid, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>observed Jan Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``Once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been working late at Yalbury Bottom,
and had had a drap of drink, and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
coming home-along through Yalbury Wood, didn't ye,
Master Poorgrass?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no; not that story!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>expostulated the
modest man, forcing a laugh to bury his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concern.
<div class="bookquote">''-- -- And so 'a lost himself quite.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued Mr
Coggan, with an impassive face, implying that a true
narrative, like time and tide, must run its course and
would respect no man. ``And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was coming along
in the middle of the night, much afeared, and not able
to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) way out of the trees nohow, 'a cried out,
``Man-a-lost! man-a-lost!'' A owl in a tree happened
to be crying ``Whoo-whoo-whoo!<div class="bookquote">'' as owls do, you
know, shepherd''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Gabriel nodded-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">'' and Joseph, all
in a tremble, said, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury,
sir!''
``No, no, now -- that's too much!'' said the timid
man, becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden.
``I didn't say sir. I'll tike my oath I didn't say <div class="bookquote">'' Joseph
Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, no; what's right
is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very
well that no man of a gentleman's rank would be
hollering there at that time o' night.<div class="bookquote">'' Joseph Poor-
grass of Weatherbury,''  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>-- that's every word I said, and
I shouldn't ha' said that if 't hadn't been for Keeper
Day's metheglin... There, 'twas a merciful thing it
ended where it did.''
The question of which was right being tacitly waived
by the company, Jan went on meditatively: --
``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)'s the fearfullest man, bain't ye, Joseph?
Ay, another time ye were lost by Lambing-Down Gate,
weren't ye, Joseph?''
``I was.'' replied Poorgrass, as if there were some
conditions too serious even for modesty to remember
itself under, this being one.
``Yes; that were the middle of the night, too. The
gate would not open, try how he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would, and knowing
there was the Devil's hand in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) kneeled down.''
``Ay.'' said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the
warmth of the fire, the cider, and a perception of the
narrative capabilities of the experience alluded to.
``My heart died within me, that time; but I kneeled
down and said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belie
right through, and then the Ten Commandments, in
earnest prayer. But no, the gate wouldn't open; and
then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and,
thinks I, this makes four, and `tis all I know out of
book, and if this don't do it nothing will, and I'm a
lost man. Well, when I got to Saying After Me, I
rose from my knees and found the gate would open
-- yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever.''
A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged
in by all, and during its continuance each directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
vision into the ashpit, which glowed like a desert in
the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long
and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the
depth of the subject discussed.
Gabriel broke the silence. ``What sort of a place
is this to live at, and what sort of a mis`ess is she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to
work under?'' Gabriel's bosom thrilled gently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the inner-
most subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heart.
``We d' know little of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) -- nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only
showed herself a few days ago. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) uncle was took
bad, and the doctor was called with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) world-wide
skill; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) couldn't save the man. As I take it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s going to keep on the farm.
<div class="bookquote">``That's about the shape o`t, 'a b`lieve.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Jan
uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know en,
be under 'em as under one here and there. Her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)
uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know `en,
shepherd -- a bachelor-man?''
``Not at all.''
``I used to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) house a-courting my first wife,
Charlotte, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dairymaid. Well, a very good-
hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and I being a
respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) and drink as much ale as I liked, but not to carry
away any -- outside my skin I mane of course.''
``Ay, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer meaning.''
``And so you see 'twas beautiful ale, and I wished
to value his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) kindness as much as I could, and not to
be so ill-mannered as to drink only a thimbleful, which
would have been insulting the man's generosity -- -- ''
``True, Master Coggan, `twould so.<div class="bookquote">'' corroborated
Mark Clark.
''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Coggan</b></font>)</div>-- -- And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore
going, and then by the time I got there I were as dry
as a lime-basket -- so thorough dry that that ale would
slip down -- ah, `twould slip down sweet! Happy
times! heavenly times! Such lovely drunks as I
used to have at that house! You can mind, Jacob?
You used to go wi' me sometimes.''
``I can -- I can.'' said Jacob. ``That one, too, that
we had at Buck's Head on a White Monday was a
pretty tipple.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>'Twas. But for a wet of the better class, that
brought you no nearer to the horned man than you were
afore you begun, there was none like those in Farmer
Everdene's kitchen. Not a single damn allowed; no,
not a bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment
when all were blindest, though the good old word of
sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
relief to a merry soul.''
``True.'' said the maltster. ``Nater requires her (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
swearing at the regular times, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)'s not herself; and
unholy exclamations is a necessity of life.''
``But Charlotte.'' continued Coggan -- ``not a word of
the sort would Charlotte allow, nor the smallest item of
taking in vain... Ay, poor Charlotte, I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had the good fortune to get into Heaven when 'a died!
But 'a was never much in luck's way, and perhaps 'a
went downwards after all, poor soul.''
``And did any of you know Miss Everdene's-father
and mother?'' inquired the shepherd, who found some
difficulty in keeping the conversation in the desired
channel.
``I knew them a little.'' said Jacob Smallbury; ``but
they were townsfolk, and didn't live here. They've
been dead for years. Father, what sort of people were
mis`ess' father and mother?''
``Well.'' said the maltster, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't much to look
at; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a lovely woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was fond enough
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sweetheart.''
``Used to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) scores and long-hundreds o times,
so 'twas said.'' observed Coggan.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too, when they were
married, as I've been told.'' said the maltster.
``Ay.'' said Coggan. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) so much that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used to light the candle three time a night to look
at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''
``Boundless love; I shouldn't have supposed it in the
universe!'' murmered Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually
spoke on a large scale in his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) moral reflections.
``Well, to be sure.'' said Gabriel.
``Oh, `tis true enough. I knowed the man and
woman both well. Levi Everdene -- that was the man's
name, sure. <div class="bookquote">``Man.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>saith I in my hurry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) were
of a higher circle of life than that -- 'a was a gentleman-
tailor really, worth scores of pounds. And he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) became
a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times.''
``Oh, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was quite a common man!'' said
Joseph.
``O no, no! That man failed for heaps of money;
hundreds in gold and silver.''
The maltster being rather short of breath, Mr. Coggan,
after absently scrutinising a coal which had fallen among
the ashes, took up the narrative, with a private twirl of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) eye: --
``Well, now, you'd hardly believe it, but that man --
husbands alive, after a while. Understand? 'a didn't
want to be fickle, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't help it. The poor
feller were faithful and true enough to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) wish,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) heart would rove, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) would. He (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) spoke
to me in real tribulation about it once. <div class="bookquote">``Coggan,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I could never wish for a handsomer woman
than I've got, but feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s ticketed as my lawful
wife, I can't help my wicked heart wandering, do what
I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But at last I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) cured it by making her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
take off her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wedding-ring and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) maiden
name as they sat together after the shop was shut, and
so 'a would get to fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was only his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) sweetheart, and
not married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) at all. And as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) could
thoroughly fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) was doing wrong and committing
the seventh, 'a got to like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as well as ever, and they
lived on a perfect picture of mutel love.''
``Well, 'twas a most ungodly remedy.'' murmured
Joseph Poorgrass; ``but we ought to feel deep cheerful-
ness that a happy Providence kept it from being any
worse. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) might have gone the bad road and
given his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) eyes to unlawfulness entirely -- yes, gross un-
lawfulness, so to say it.''
``You see.'' said Billy Smallbury, ``The man's will was
to do right, sure enough, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart didn't chime in.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got so much better, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite godly
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) later years, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Jan?'' said Joseph Poor-
grass. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) got himself confirmed over again in a more
serious way, and took to saying <div class="bookquote">``Amen''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>almost as loud
as the clerk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poor</b></font>) liked to copy comforting verses
from the tombstones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poor</b></font>) used, too, to hold the money-
plate at Let Your Light so Shine, and stand godfather
to poor little come-by-chance children; and he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) kept a
missionary box upon his (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) table to nab folks unawares
when they called; yes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>godfather</b></font>) would-box the charity-
boys' ears, if they laughed in church, till they could
hardly stand upright, and do other deeds of piety
natural to the saintly inclined.''
``Ay, at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) thought of nothing but high
things.'' added Billy Smallbury. ``One day Parson Thirdly
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-Morning, Mister Everdene; `tis
a fine day!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Amen''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Everdene, quite absent-
like, thinking only of religion when he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) seed a parson-
<div class="bookquote">``Their daughter was not at all a pretty chile at that
time.''  (<font color='red'><b>a parson</b></font>)</div>said Henery Fray. <div class="bookquote">``Never should have. thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'d have growed up such a handsome body as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis to be hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) temper is as good as her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; but the baily will have most to do with
the business and ourselves. Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Henery</b></font>)</div>Henery gazed into
the ashpit, and smiled volumes of ironical knowledge.
``A queer Christian, like the Devil's head in a cowl,
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is.'' said Henery, implying that irony must cease
at a certain point. ``Between we two, man and man, I
believe that man would as soon tell a lie Sundays as
working-days -- that I do so.''
``Good faith, you do talk!'' said Gabriel.
``True enough.'' said the man of bitter moods, looking
round upon the company with the antithetic laughter
that comes from a keener appreciation of the miseries
of life than ordinary men are capable of. ``Ah, there's
people of one sort, and people of another, but that man
-- bless your souls!''
Gabriel thought fit to change the subject. ``You
must be a very aged man, malter, to have sons growed
mild and ancient'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) remarked.
``Father's so old that 'a can't mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) age, can ye,
father?'' interposed Jacob. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) growled terrible
crooked too, lately'' Jacob continued, surveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
father's figure, which was rather more bowed than his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own.
``Really one may say that father there is three-double.''
``Crooked folk will last a long while.'' said the maltster,
grimly, and not in the best humour.
``Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer
life, father -- wouldn't ye, shepherd?
<div class="bookquote">``Ay that I should.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel with the heartiness
of a man who had longed to hear it for several months.
<div class="bookquote">``What may your age be, malter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The maltster cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) throat in an exaggerated
form for emphasis, and elongating his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) gaze to the
remotest point of the ashpit! said, in the slow speech
justifiable when the importance of a subject is so
generally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated
in getting at it, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't mind the year I were

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hundred and seventeen.''  (<font color='red'><b>another gentleman</b></font>)</div>chuckled another old
gentleman, given to mental arithmetic and little con-
versation, who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, that's my age.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the maltster, em-
phatically.
<div class="bookquote">``O no, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Jacob. <div class="bookquote">``Your turnip-hoeing
were in the summer and your malting in the winter of
the same years, and ye don't ought to count-both halves
father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Chok' it all! I lived through the summers, didn't
I? That's my question. I suppose ye'll say next I be
no age at all to speak of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sure we shan't.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, soothingly.
<div class="bookquote">``Ye be a very old aged person, malter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>attested Jan
must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able
to live so long, mustn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>), neighbours?''
``True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful,<div class="bookquote">'' said the
meeting unanimously.
The maltster, being know pacified, was even generous
enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degree the
virtue of having lived a great many years, by mentioning
that the cup they were drinking out of was three years
older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>).
While the cup was being examined, the end of
Gabriel Oak's flute became visible over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) smock-frock
I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at Caster-
bridge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You did.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, blushing faintly. <div class="bookquote">``I've been
in great trouble, neighbours, and was driven to it.
take it careless-like, shepherd and your time will come
tired?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since
Christmas.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Jan Coggan. <div class="bookquote">``Come, raise a tune,
Master Oak!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) flute and
putting it together. <div class="bookquote">``A poor tool, neighbours; but
such as I can do ye shall have and welcome.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak then struck up <div class="bookquote">``Jockey to the Fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>jerks</b></font>)</div>and played
that sparkling melody three times through accenting the
notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively
manner by bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) body in small jerks and tapping
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) foot to beat time.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) can blow the flute very well -- that 'a can.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said
a young married man, who having no individuality worth
mentioning was known as <div class="bookquote">``Susan Tall's husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``I'd as lief as not be able to blow into a
flute as well-as that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a clever man, and `tis a true comfort for us to
have such a shepherd.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in
a soft cadence. <div class="bookquote">``We ought to feel full o' thanksgiving
that he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)'s not a player of ba`dy songs `instead of these
merry tunes; for `twould have been just as easy for God
to have made the shepherd a loose low man -- a man of
iniquity, so to speak it -- as what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. Yes, for our wives''
 (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>and daughters' sakes we should feel real thanks giving.''
``True, true, -- real thanksgiving!'' dashed in Mark
Clark conclusively, not feeling it to be of any conse-
quence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) had only heard about a
word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said.
``Yes.'' added Joseph, beginning to feel like a man in
the Bible; ``for evil do thrive so in these times that ye
may be as much deceived in the cleanest shaved and
whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the
turnpike, if I may term it so.''
``Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd.'' said
Henery Fray, criticising Gabriel with misty eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
entered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) second tune. ``Yes -- now I see `ee
blowing into the flute I know `ee to be the same man
I see play at Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped
up and yer eyes a-staring out like a strangled man's --
just as they be now.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>`Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man
look such a scarecrow.'' observed Mr. Mark Clark, with
additional criticism of Gabriel's countenance, the latter
person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by
the instrument, the chorus of ``Dame Durden!
<div class="bookquote">``I hope you don't mind that young man's bad
manners in naming your features?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>whispered Joseph to
Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Not at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Oak</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``For by nature ye be a very handsome man,
shepherd.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>continued Joseph Poorgrass, with winning
sauvity.
<div class="bookquote">``Ay, that ye be, shepard.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the company.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Oak, in the modest
tone good manners demanded, thinking, however, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would never let Bathsheba see him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) playing the
flute; in this severe showing a discretion equal to that
related to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva
herself.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe
Church.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the old maltster, not pleased at finding
himself left out of the subject <div class="bookquote">``we were called the
handsomest couple in the neighbourhood -- everybody
said so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Danged if ye bain't altered now, malter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice
with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark-
ably evident truism. It came from the old man in the
background, whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were
barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) con-
tributed to general laughs.
<div class="bookquote">``O no, no.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't ye play no more shepherd''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>said Susan Tall's
husband, the young married man who had spoken once
before. <div class="bookquote">``I must be moving and when there's tunes
going on I seem as if hung in wires. If I thought after
I'd left that music was still playing, and I not there, I
should be quite melancholy-like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What's yer hurry then, Laban?''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>inquired Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``You used to bide as late as the latest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a
woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s my vocation now, and so ye see -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man hated lamely.
<div class="bookquote">``New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>remarked Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``Ay, 'a b`lieve -- ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>said Susan Tall's husband,
in a tone intended to imply his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) habitual reception of
jokes without minding them at all. The young man
then wished them good-night and withdrew.
Henery Fray was the first to follow. Then Gabriel
arose and went off with Jan Coggan, who had offered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a lodging. A few minutes later, when the remaining
ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray came
back again in a hurry. Flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) finger ominously
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) threw a gaze teeming with tidings just -- where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eye
alighted by accident, which happened to be in Joseph
Poorgrass's face.
<div class="bookquote">``O -- what's the matter, what's the matter, Henery?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, starting back.
<div class="bookquote">``What's a-brewing, Henrey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>asked Jacob and Mark
Clark.
<div class="bookquote">``Baily Pennyways -- Baily Pennyways -- I said so; yes,
I said so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, found out stealing anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stealing it is. The news is, that after Miss
Everdene got home she (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) went out again to see all was
safe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) usually do, and coming in found Baily
Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a
a bushel of barley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) fleed at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) like a cat -- never
such a tomboy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) is -- of course I speak with closed
doors?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do -- you do, Henery.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) fleed at him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and, to cut a long story short,
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) owned to having carried off five sack altogether, upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Everdene</b></font>) promising not to persecute him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s turned
out neck and crop, and my question is, who's going to
be baily now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henery</b></font>)</div>The question was such a profound one that Henery
was obliged to drink there and then from the large
cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside. Before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) had replaced it on the table, in came the young man,
Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.
<div class="bookquote">``Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About Baily Pennyways?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But besides that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- not a morsel of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>they replied, looking into
the very midst of Laban Tall as if to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words
half-way down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat.
<div class="bookquote">``What a night of horrors!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph Poor</b></font>)</div>murmured Joseph Poor-
grass, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands spasmodically. <div class="bookquote">``I've had the
news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
murder, and I've seen a magpie all alone!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fanny Robin -- Miss everdene's youngest servant --
can't be found. They've been wanting to lock up the
door these two hours, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) isn't come in. And they
don't know what to do about going to hed for fear of
locking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) out. They wouldn't be so concerned if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
hadn't been noticed in such low spirits these last few
days, and Maryann d'think the beginning of a crowner's
inquest has happened to the poor girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O -- `tis burned -- `tis burned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>came from Joseph
Poorgrass's dry lips.
<div class="bookquote">``No -- `tis drowned!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``Or `tis her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's razor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Billy Smallbury/Billy</b></font>)</div>suggested Billy Smallbury,
with a vivid sense of detail.
<div class="bookquote">``Well -- Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two
of us before we go to bed. What with this trouble about
the baily, and now about the girl, mis`ess is almost wild.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse,
excepting the old maltster, whom neither news, fire,
rain, nor thunder could draw from his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) hole. There, as
the others' footsteps died away he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) sat down again and
continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) red,
bleared eyes.
From the bedroom window above their heads Bath-
sheba's head and shoulders, robed in mystic white, were
dimly seen extended into the air.
<div class="bookquote">``Are any of my men among you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said anxiously.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, several.''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>said Susan Tall's husband.
<div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow morning I wish two or three of you to
make inquiries in the villages round if they have seen
such a person as Fanny Robin. Do it quietly; there is
no reason for alarm as yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have left whilst
we were all at the fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I beg yer pardon, but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) any young man court-
ing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the parish, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>asked Jacob Smallbury.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
two or three.
<div class="bookquote">``It is hardly likely, either.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>continued Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``For any lover of hers might have come to the house if
he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been a respectable lad. The most mysterious
matter connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence -- indeed, the only
thing which gives me serious alarm -- is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
seen to go out of the house by Maryann with only her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
indoor working gown on -- not even a bonnet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a
young woman would hardly go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) young man
without dressing up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jacob/Jacob Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Jacob, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) mental
vision upon past experiences. <div class="bookquote">``That's true -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
not, ma'am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't see
very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maryann/Maryann Money</b></font>)</div>said a female voice from another window,
which seemed that of Maryann. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no
young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, and
I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a soldier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba said.
<div class="bookquote">``No, mistress; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was very close about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to
Casterbridge barracks.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said William Smallbury.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well; if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) doesn't return tomorrow, mind
you go there and try to discover which man it is, and
see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I feel more responsible than I should if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
has come to no harm through a man of that kind...
And then there's this disgraceful affair of the bailiff --
but I can't speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that
it seemed she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) did not think it worth while to dwell
upon any particular one. <div class="bookquote">``Do as I told you, then''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) said in conclusion, closing the casement.
<div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, mistress; we will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they replied, and moved
away.
That night at Coggan's, Gabriel Oak, beneath the
screen of closed eyelids, was busy with fancies, and full
of movement, like a river flowing rapidly under its ice.
Night had always been the time at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) saw Bath-
sheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of
shadow he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) tenderly regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) image now. It is
rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will compen-
sate for the pain of sleeplessness, but they possibly did
with Oak to-night, for the delight of merely seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
effaced for the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) perception of the great differ-
ence between seeing and possessing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) also thought of Plans for fetching his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) few utensils
and books from Norcombe. The Young Man's Best
Companion, The Farrier's Sure Guide, The Veterinary
Surgeon, Paradise Lost, The Pilgrim's Progress, Robinson
Crusoe, Ash's Dictionary, the Walkingame's Arithmetic,
constituted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) library; and though a limited series, it was
one from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) had acquired more sound informa-
tion by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities
has done from a furlong of laden shelves.




<p/>CHAPTER IX



<p/>THE HOMESTEAD -- A VISITOR -- HALF-CONFIDENCES


<p/>By daylight, the Bower of Oak's new-found mistress,
Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary build-
ing, of the early stage of Classic Renaissance as regards
its architecture, and of 'a proportion which told at a
glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once
been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it,
now altogether effaced as a distinct property, and merged
in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord, which com-
prised several such modest demesnes.
Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone,
decorated its front, and above the roof the chimneys
were panelled or columnar, some coped gables with
finials and like features still retaining traces of their
Gothic extraction. Soft Brown mosses, like faded
velveteen, formed cushions upon the stone tiling, and
tufts of the houseleek or sengreen sprouted from the
eaves of the low surrounding buildings. A gravel walk
leading from the door to the road in front was encrusted
at the sides with more moss -- here it was a silver-green
variety, the nut-brown of the gravel being visible to the
width of only a foot or two in the centre. This circum-
stance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect
here, together with the animated and contrasting state
of the reverse facade, suggested to the imagination that
on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes
the vital principle' of the house had turned round inside
its body to face the other way. Reversals of this kind,
strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen
to be inflicted by trade upon edifices -- either individual
or in the aggregate as streets and towns -- which were
originally planned for pleasure alone.
Lively voices were heard this morning in the upper
rooms, the main staircase to which was of hard oak, the
balusters, heavy as bed-posts, being turned and moulded
in the quaint fashion of their century, the handrail as
stout as a parapet-top, and the stairs themselves con-
tinually twisting round like a person trying to look over
his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) shoulder. Going up, the floors above were found
to have a very irregular surface, rising to ridges, sinking
into valley; and being just then uncarpeted, the face
of the boards was seen to be eaten into innumerable
the opening and shutting of every door a tremble
followed every bustling movement, and a creak accom-
panied a walker about the house like a spirit, wherever-
he (<font color='blue'><b>walker</b></font>) went.
In the room from which the conversation proceeded,
Bathsheba and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) servant-companion, Liddy Small-
bury were to be discovered sitting upon the floor, and
sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles, and
rubbish spread out thereon -- remnants from the house-
hold stores of the late occupier. Liddy, the maltster's
great-granddaughter, was about Bathsheba's equal in
age, and her (<font color='blue'><b>great-granddaughter</b></font>) face was a prominent advertisement of the
features' might have lacked in form was amply made up
for by perfection of hue, which at this winter-time was
the softened ruddiness on a surface of high rotundity
and, like the presentations of those great colourists, it
was a face which kept well back from the boundary
between comeliness and the ideal. Though elastic in
nature she (<font color='blue'><b>great-granddaughter</b></font>) was less daring than Bathsheba, and occa-
sionally showed some earnestness, which consisted half
of genuine feeling, and half of mannerliness superadded
by way of duty.
Through a partly-opened door the noise of a scrubbing-
brush led up to the charwoman, Maryann Money, a person
who for a face had a circular disc, furrowed less by age
than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects. To
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Money</b></font>) was to get good-humoured; to speak of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Money</b></font>) was to raise the image of a dried Normandy
pippin.
<div class="bookquote">``Stop your scrubbing a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba
through the door to her (<font color='blue'><b>Money</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I hear something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maryann/Maryann Money</b></font>)</div>Maryann suspended the brush.
The tramp of a horse was apparent, approaching the
front of the building. The paces slackened, turned in
at the wicket, and, what was most unusual, came up
the mossy path close to the door. The door was
tapped with the end of a crop or stick.
<div class="bookquote">``What impertinence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, in a low voice.
``To ride up the footpath like that! Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>)
stop at the gate? Lord! ``Tis a gentleman! I see the
top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hat.''
``Be quiet!'' said Bathsheba.
The further expression of Liddy's concern was con-
tinued by aspect instead of narrative.
``Why doesn't Mrs. Coggan go to the door?'' Bath-
sheba continued.
Rat-tat-tat-tat, resounded more decisively from Bath-
sheba's oak.
``Maryann, you go!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>), fluttering under the
onset of a crowd of romantic possibilities.
``O ma'am -- see, here's a mess!''
The argument was unanswerable after a glance at
Maryann.
``Liddy -- you must.'' said Bathsheba.
Liddy held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) hands and arms, coated with dust
from the rubbish they were sorting, and looked implor-
ingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) mistress.
``There -- Mrs. Coggan is going!'' said Bathsheba,
exhaling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) relief in the form of a long breath which
had lain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) bosom a minute or more.
The door opened, and a deep voice said --
``Is Miss Everdene at home?''
``I'll see, sir.'' said Mrs. Coggan, and in a minute
appeared in the room.
``Dear, what a thirtover place this world is!'' con-
tinued Mrs. Coggan -LRB-a wholesome-looking lady who
had a voice for each class of remark according to the
emotion involved; who could toss a pancake or twirl
a mop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and
who at this moment showed hands shaggy with frag-
ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour-RRB-. ``I
am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding
but one of two things do happen -- either my nose must
needs begin tickling, and I can't live without scratching
A woman's dress being a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) countenance,
and any disorder in the one being of the same nature
with a malformation or wound in the other, Bathsheba
said at once --
<div class="bookquote">``I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in this state. Whatever shall I do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Not-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury
farmhouses, so Liddy suggested -- <div class="bookquote">``Say you're a fright
with dust, and can't come down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- that sounds very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coggan</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Coggan,
critically.
<div class="bookquote">``Say I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) -- that will do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coggan</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Coggan went downstairs, and returned the
answer as requested, adding, however, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) own
responsibility, <div class="bookquote">``Miss is dusting bottles, sir, and is quite
a object -- that's why `tis.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coggan</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the deep voice.'' indifferently.
``All I wanted to ask was, if anything had been heard
of Fanny Robin?''
``Nothing, sir -- but we may know to-night. William
Smallbury is gone to Casterbridge, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) young
man lives, as is supposed, and the other men be inquir-
ing about everywhere.''
The horse's tramp then recommenced and -retreated,
and the door closed.
``Who is Mr. Boldwood?'' said Bathsheba.
``A gentleman-farmer at Little Weatherbury.''
``Married?''
``No, miss.''
``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)?''
``Forty, I should say -- very handsome -- rather stern-
looking -- and rich.''
``What a bother this dusting is! I am always in
some unfortunate plight or other,'' Bathsheba said,
complainingly. ``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) inquire about Fanny?''
``Oh, because, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no friends in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) childhood,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to school, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
place here under your uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)'s a very kind man
that way, but Lord -- there!''
``What?''
``Never was such a hopeless man for a woman!
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been courted by sixes and sevens -- all the girls,
gentle and simple, for miles round, have tried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Jane
Perkins worked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) for two months like a slave,
and the two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perkins</b></font>) cost Farmer Ives's daughter nights of tears
and twenty pounds' worth of new clothes; but Lord --
the money might as well have been thrown out of the
window.''
A little boy came up at this moment and looked in
upon them. This child was one of the Coggans who,
with the Smallburys, were as common among the
families of this district as the Avons and Derwents
among our rivers. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always had a loosened tooth or
a cut finger to show to particular friends, which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did
with an air of being thereby elevated above the common
herd of afflictionless humanity -- to which exhibition
of congratulation as well as pity.
``I've got a pen-nee!'' said Master Coggan in a
scanning measure.
``Well -- who gave it you, Teddy?'' said Liddy.
``Mis-terr Bold-wood! He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) gave it to me for opening
the gate.''
``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) say?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, my little man?'''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and I said, <div class="bookquote">``To Miss Everdene's please,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a staid woman, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), my little man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and
I said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You naughty child! What did you say that for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cause he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me the penny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a pucker everything is in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba,
discontentedly when the child had gone. <div class="bookquote">``Get away,
thing! You ought to be married by this time, and not
here troubling me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, mistress -- so I did. But what between the poor
men I won't have, and the rich men who won't have me,
I stand as a pelicon in the wilderness!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did anybody ever want to marry you miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy
ventured to ask when they were again alone. ``Lots of
``em, i daresay.?''
Bathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but
the temptation to say yes, since it was really in her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
power was irresistible by aspiring virginity, in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) spleen at having been published as old.
``A man wanted to once.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) said, in a highly experi-
enced tone and the image of Gabriel Oak, as the farmer,
rose before her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>).
``How nice it must seem!'' said Liddy, with the fixed
features of mental realization. ``And you wouldn't have
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasn't quite good enough for me.''
``How sweet to be able to disdain, when most of us
are glad to say, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I seem I hear it.
<div class="bookquote">``No, sir -- I'm your better.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Kiss my foot, sir; my
face is for mouths of consequence.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And did you love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>), miss?''
``Oh, no. But I rather liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
``Do you now?''
``Of course not -- what footsteps are those I hear?''
Liddy looked from a back window into the courtyard
behind, which was now getting low-toned and dim with
the earliest films of night. A crooked file of men was
approaching the back door. The whole string of trailing
individuals advanced in the completest balance of inten-
tion, like the remarkable creatures known as Chain
Salpae, which, distinctly organized in other respects, have
one will common to a whole family. Some were, as
usual, in snow-white smock-frocks of Russia duck, and
some in whitey-brown ones of drabbet -- marked on the
wrists, breasts, backs, and sleeves with honeycomb-work.
Two or three women in pattens brought up the rear.
``The Philistines be upon us.'' said Liddy, making her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>)
nose white against the glass.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well. Maryann, go down and keep them
in the kitchen till I am dressed, and then show them in
to me in the hall.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X



<p/>HALF-AN-HOUR later Bathsheba, in finished dress,


<p/>and followed by Liddy, entered the upper end of the old
hall to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) men had all deposited themselves on
a long form and a settle at the lower extremity. She (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) sat
down at a table and opened the time-book, pen in her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>)
hand, with a canvas money-bag beside her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>). From this
she (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) poured a small heap of coin. Liddy chose a
position at her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) elbow and began to sew, sometimes
pausing and looking round, or with the air of a privileged
person, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying before
her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) and surveying it merely as a work of art, while
strictly preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) countenance from expressing any
wish to possess it as money.
<div class="bookquote">``Now before I begin, men.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, <div class="bookquote">``I have
two matters to speak of. The first is that the bailiff is
dismissed for thieving, and that I have formed a resolu-
tion to have no bailiff at all, but to manage everything
with my own head and hands.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>The men breathed an audible breath of amazement.
<div class="bookquote">``The next matter is, have you heard anything of
Fanny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Nothing, ma'am.
``Have you done anything?''
``I met Farmer Boldwood.<div class="bookquote">'' said Jacob Smallbury, `and
I went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) men, and dragged New-
mill Pond, but we found nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the new shepherd have been to Buck's Head,
by Yalbury, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had gone there, but nobody
had seed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Laban</b></font>)</div>said Laban Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``Hasn't William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)'s not yet come home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)
promised to be back by six.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It wants a quarter to six at present.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba,
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``I daresay he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)'ll be in directly.
Well, now then''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- she (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) looked into the book -- <div class="bookquote">``Joseph
Poorgrass, are you there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir -- ma'am I mane.''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>said the person addressed.
<div class="bookquote">``I be the personal name of Poorgrass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing in my own eye. In the eye of other people
-- well, I don't say it; though public thought will out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What do you do on the farm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do do carting things all the year, and in seed time I
shoots the rooks and sparrows, and helps at pig-killing, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How much to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Please nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny
where 'twas a bad one, sir -- ma'am I mane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite correct. Now here are ten shillings in addi-
tion as a small present, as I am a new comer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being
generous in public, and Henery Fray, who had drawn
up towards her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) chair, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) eyebrows and fingers to
express amazement on a small scale.
<div class="bookquote">``How much do I owe you -- that man in the corner --
what's your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>continued Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``Matthew Moon, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a singular framework of
clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them,
which advanced with the toes in no definite direction
forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to swing.
<div class="bookquote">``Matthew Mark, did you say? -- speak out -- I shall
not hurt you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>inquired the young farmer, kindly.
<div class="bookquote">``Matthew Moon mem''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Henery Fray, correct-
ingly, from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) chair, to which point he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had
edged himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Matthew Moon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>murmured Bathsheba, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>)
bright eyes to the book. <div class="bookquote">``Ten and twopence halfpenny
is the sum put down to you, I see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mis`ess.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, as the rustle of wind
among dead leaves.
<div class="bookquote">``Here it is and ten shillings. Now -the next -- Andrew
Randle, you are a new man, I hear. How come you to
leave your last farm?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``P-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease, ma'am, p-p-p-p-pl-pl-
pl-pl-please, ma'am-please'm-please'm -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`A's a stammering man, mem.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Henery Fray in
an undertone, ``and they turned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away because the
only time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever did speak plain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul was
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, and other iniquities, to the squire. ``A can cuss,
mem, as well as you or I, but 'a can't speak a common
speech to save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.''
``Andrew Randle, here's yours -- finish thanking me
in a day or two. Temperance Miller -- oh, here's another,
Soberness -- both women I suppose?''
``Yes'm. Here we be, 'a b`lieve.'' was echoed in shrill
unison.
``What have you been doing?''
``Tending thrashing-machine and wimbling haybonds,
and saying <div class="bookquote">``Hoosh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thompson</b></font>)</div>to the cocks and hens when they
go upon your seeds and planting Early Flourballs and
Thompson's Wonderfuls with a dibble.''
``Yes -- I see. Are they satisfactory women?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>)
inquired softly of Henery Fray.
``O mem -- don't ask me! Yielding women?<div class="bookquote">'' as
scarlet a pair as ever was!''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>groaned Henery under his (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>)
breath.
``Sit down.
``Who, mem?''
``Sit down,''
Joseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) lips became dry with fear of some terrible conse-
quences, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) saw Bathsheba summarily speaking, and
Henery slinking off to a corner.
``Now the next. Laban Tall, you'll stay on working
for me?''
``For you or anybody that pays me well, ma'am,''
replied the young married man.
``True -- the man must live!'' said a woman in the
back quarter, who had just entered with clicking pattens.
``What woman is that?'' Bathsheba asked.
``I be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lawful wife!'' continued the voice with
greater prominence of manner and tone. This lady
called herself five-and-twenty, looked thirty, passed as
thirty-five, and was forty. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a woman who never,
like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in
public, perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had none to show.
``Oh, you are.'' said Bathsheba. ``Well, Laban, will
you stay on?''
``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll stay, ma'am!'' said again the shrill tongue
of Laban's lawful wife.
``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can speak for himself, I suppose.''
``O Lord, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), ma'am! A simple tool. Well
enough, but a poor gawkhammer mortal.'' the wife replied
``Heh-heh-heh!'' laughed the married man with a
hideous effort of appreciation, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as irrepressibly
good-humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary
candidate on the hustings.
The names remaining were called in the same
manner.
``Now I think I have done with you.'' said Bathsheba,
closing the book and shaking back a stray twine of hair.
``Has William Smallbury returned?''
``No, ma'am.''
``The new shepherd will want a man under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''
suggested Henery Fray, trying to make himself official
again by a sideway approach towards her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chair.
``Oh -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will. Who can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have?''
``Young Cain Ball is a very good lad.'' Henery said,
``and Shepherd Oak don't mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) youth?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added,
turning with an apologetic smile to the shepherd, who
had just appeared on the scene, and was now leaning
against the doorpost with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded.
``No, I don't mind that.'' said Gabriel.
``How did Cain come by such a name?'' asked
Bathsheba.
``Oh you see, mem, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) pore mother, not being a
Scripture-read woman made a mistake at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) christening,
thinking 'twas Abel killed Cain, and called en Cain,
but 'twas too late, for the name could never be got rid
of in the parish. <div class="bookquote">``Tis very unfortunate for the boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is rather unfortunate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. However, we soften it down as much as we
can, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Cainey. Ah, pore widow-woman!
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart out about it almost. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
brought up by a very heathen father and mother, who
never sent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to church or school, and it shows how
the sins of the parents are visited upon the children,
mem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Fray here drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) features to the mild degree
of melancholy required when the persons involved in
the given misfortune do not belong to your own family.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well then, Cainey Ball to be under-shepherd
And you quite understand your duties? -- you I mean,
Gabriel Oak?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite well, I thank you Miss Everdene.''  (<font color='red'><b>Shepard</b></font>)</div>said
Shepard Oak from the doorpost. <div class="bookquote">``If I don't, I'll
inquire.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel was rather staggered by the remark-
able coolness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) manner. Certainly nobody without
previous information would have dreamt that Oak and
the handsome woman before whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) stood had ever
been other than strangers. But perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air was
the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from a cottage to a large house and fields. The
case is not unexampled in high places. When, in the
writings of the later poets, Jove and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) family are found
to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak
of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show
a proportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.
Footsteps were heard in the passage, combining in
their character the qualities both of weight and measure,
rather at the expense of velocity.
-LRB-All.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Here's Billy Smallbury come from Caster-
bridge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what's the news?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, as William,
after marching to the middle of the hall, took a hand-
kerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) hat and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) forehead from its
centre to its remoter boundaries.
<div class="bookquote">``I should have been sooner, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if it
hadn't been for the weather.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) then stamped with
each foot severely, and on looking down his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) boots were
perceived to be clogged with snow.
<div class="bookquote">``Come at last, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henery</b></font>)</div>said Henery.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, what about Fanny?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, ma'am, in round numbers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s run away with
the soldiers.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said William.
<div class="bookquote">``No; not a steady girl like Fanny!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell ye all particulars. When I got to Caster,

The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards.

 (<font color='red'><b>troops</b></font>)</div>Gabriel had listened with interest. <div class="bookquote">``I saw them go,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Smallbury</b></font>)</div>continued William,'' they pranced down the
street playing ``The Girl I Left Behind Me.<div class="bookquote">'' so `tis
said, in glorious notes of triumph. Every looker-on's
inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)

less women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, ma'am; but they be gone to take the places

that's it in black and white.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel remained musing and said nothing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
was in doubt.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, we are not likely to know more to-night, at
any rate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba. <div class="bookquote">``But one of you had better
run across to Farmer Boldwood's and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) that

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) then rose; but before retiring, addressed a few
words to them with a pretty dignity, to which her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
mourning dress added a soberness that was hardly to
be found in the words themselves.
<div class="bookquote">``Now mind, you have a mistress instead of a master

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then this small-thesmothete stepped from the table,
and surged out of the hall, her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) black silk dress licking
up a few straws and dragging them along with a scratch-
ing noise upon the floor. biddy, elevating her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) feelings
to the occasion from a sense of grandeur, floated off
behind Bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely
free from travesty, and the door was closed.




<p/>CHAPTER XI



<p/>OUTSIDE THE BARRACKS -- SNOW -- A MEETING


<p/>FOR dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the
outskirts of a certain town and military station, many
miles north of Weatherbury, at a later hour on this
same snowy evening -- if that may be called a prospect
of which the chief constituent was darkness.
It was a night when sorrow may come to the
brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity:
when, with impressible persons, love becomes solicitous-
ness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope: when
the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret
at opportunities for ambition that have been passed by,
and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.
The scene was a public path, bordered on the left
hand by a river, behind which rose a high wall. On
the right was a tract of land, partly meadow`and partly
moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide undulating
uplan.
The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on
spots of this kind than amid woodland scenery. Still,
to a close observer, they are just as perceptible; the
difference is that their media of manifestation are less
trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the
bursting of the buds or the fall of the leaf. Many are
not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to
imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor
or waste. Winter, in coming to the country hereabout,
advanced in well-marked stages, wherein might have
been successively observed the retreat of the snakes,
the transformation of the ferns, the filling of the pools,
a rising of fogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse
of the fungi, and an obliteration by snow.
This climax of the series had been reached to-night on
the aforesaid moor, and for the first time in the season
its irregularities were forms without features; suggestive
of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more
character than that of being the limit of something
else -- the lowest layer of a firmament of snow. From
this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and
moor momentarily received additional clothing, only
to appear momentarily more naked thereby. The vast
arch of cloud above was strangely low, and formed as
it were the roof of a large dark cavern, gradually sinking
in upon its floor; for the instinctive thought was that
the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the
earth would soon unite into one mass without any
intervening stratum of air at all.
We turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics;
which were flatness in respect of the river, verticality
in respect of the wall behind it, and darkness as to
both. These features made up the mass. If anything
could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any
thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river
beneath. The indistinct summit of the facade was
notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and
upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes
of windows, though only in the upper part. Below,
down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by
hole or projection.
An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing
in their regularity, sent their sound- with difficulty
through the fluffy atmosphere. It was a neighbouring
clock striking ten The bell was in the open air, and
being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow, had
lost its voice for the time.
About this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell
where twenty had fallen, then one had the room of
ten. Not long after a form moved by the brink of
the river.
By its outline upon the colourless background, a close
observer might have seen that it was small. This was
all that was positively discoverable, though it seemed
human.
The shape went slowly along, but without much
exertion, for the snow, though sudden, was not as yet
more than two inches deep. At this time some words
were spoken aloud: --
<div class="bookquote">``One. Two. Three. Four. Five.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>Between each utterance the little shape advanced
about half a dozen yards. It was evident now that
the windows high in the wall were being counted.
The word <div class="bookquote">``Five''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>represented the fifth window from
the end of the wall.
Here the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller. The
figure was stooping. Then a morsel of snow flew
across the river towards the fifth window. It smacked
against the wall at a point several yards from its mark.
The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the
execution of a woman. No man who had ever seen bird,
rabbit, or squirrel in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood, could possibly have
thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.
Another attempt, and another; till by degrees the
wall must have become pimpled with the adhering
lumps of snow At last one fragment struck the fifth
window.
The river would have been; seen by day to be of
that deep smooth sort which races middle and sides
with the same gliding precision, any irregularities of
speed being immediately corrected by a small whirl-
pool. Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but
the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible wheels --
together with a few small sounds which a sad man
would have called moans, and a happy man laughter --
caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling
objects in other parts of the stream.
The window was struck again in the same manner.
Then a noise was heard, apparently produced by
the opening of the window. This was followed by a
voice from the same quarter.
<div class="bookquote">``Who's there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.
The high wall being that of a barrack, and marriage
being looked upon with disfavour in the army, assigna-
tions and communications had probably been made
across the river before tonight.
<div class="bookquote">``Is it Sergeant Troy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the blurred spot in the
snow, tremulously.
This person was so much like a mere shade upon
the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of
the building, that one would have said the wall was
holding a conversation with the snow.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came suspiciously from the shadow.<div class="bookquote">'' What
girl are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Frank -- don't you know me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the spot.
<div class="bookquote">``Your wife, Fanny Robin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fanny!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the wall, in utter astonishment.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of
emotion.
There was something in the woman's tone which is
not that of the wife, and there was a mannerin the man
which is rarely a husband's. The dialogue went on:
<div class="bookquote">``How did you come here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I asked which was your window. Forgive me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect you to-night. Indeed, I did not
think you would come at all. It was a wonder you
found me here. I am orderly to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You said I was to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well -- I said that you might.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I mean that I might. You are glad to see me,
Frank?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes -- of course.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you -- come to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fan no</b></font>)</div>My dear Fan, no! The bugle has sounded, the
barrack gates are closed, and I have no leave. We are
all of us as good as in the county gaol till to-morrow
morning.''
``Then I shan't see you till then!'' The words- were
in a faltering tone of disappointment.
``How did you get here from Weatherbury?''
``I walked -- some part of the way -- the rest by the
carriers.''
``I am surprised.''
``Yes -- so am I. And Frank, when will it be?''
``What?''
``That you promised.''
``I don't quite recollect.''
``O You do! Don't speak like that. It weighs me
to the earth. It makes me say what ought to be said
first by you.''
``Never mind -- say it.''
``O, must I? -- it is, when shall we be married,
Frank?''
``Oh, I <div class="bookquote">'' see. Well -- you have to get proper
clothes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have money. Will it be by banns or license?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Banns, I should think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And we live in two parishes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do we? What then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My lodgings are in St. Mary's, and this is not. So

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that the law?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. O Frank -- you think me forward, I am

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, now! It is foolish. If i said so, of

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And shall I put up the banns in my parish, and will

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- yes -- it is. It was wrong of me to worry you.
I'll go away now. Will you come and see me to-morrow,
at Mrs. Twills's, in North Street? I don't like to come
to the Barracks. There are bad women about, and they
think me one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite,so. I'll come to you, my dean Good-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Frank -- good-night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the noise was again heard of a window closing
The little spot moved away. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) passed the
corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
wall.
<div class="bookquote">``Ho -- ho -- Sergeant -- ho -- ho!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>An expostulation
followed, but it was indistinct; and it became lost amid
a low peal of laughter, which was hardly distinguishable
from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside.




<p/>CHAPTER XII



<p/>FARMERS -- A RULE -- IN EXCEPTION


<p/>THE first public evidence of Bathsheba's decision to
be a farmer in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own person and by proxy no more
was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appearance the following market-day in. the
cornmarket at Casterbridge.
The low though extensive hall, supported by beams
and pillars, and latterly dignified by-the name of Corn Ex-
change, was thronged with hot men who talked among
each other in twos and threes, the speaker of the minute
looking sideways into his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) auditor's face and concentrating
his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) argument by a contraction of one eyelid during de-
livery. The greater number carried in their hands
ground-ash saplings, using them partly as walking-sticks
and partly for poking up pigs, sheep, neighbours with
their backs turned, and restful things in general, which
seemed to require such treatment in the course of their
peregrinations. During conversations each subjected
his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) sapling to great varieties of usage -- bending it round
his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) back, forming an``arch of it between his (<font color='blue'><b>ho</b></font>) two hands,
overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a
semicircle; or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the
arm whilst the sample-bag was pulled forth and a hand-
ful of corn poured into the palm, which, after criticism,
was flung upon the floor, an issue of events perfectly
well known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which
had as usual crept into the building unobserved, and
waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high-
stretched neck and oblique eye.
Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided,
the single one of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sex that the room contained. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
was prettily and even daintily dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) moved
between them as a chaise between carts, was heard after
them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them
like a breeze among furnaces. It had required a little
determination -- far more than she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had at first imagined
-- to take up a position here, for at her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) first entry the
lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every face had
been turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and those that were already
turned rigidly fixed there.
Two or three only of the farmers were personally
known to Bathsheba, and to these she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
way. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was to be the practical woman she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had
intended to show herself, business must be carried on,
introductions or none, and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) ultimately acquired con-
fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely
known to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) by hearsay. Bathsheba too had her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
sample-bags, and by degrees adopted the professional
pour into the hand -- holding up the grains in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) narrow
palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge manner.
Something in the exact arch of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) upper unbroken
row of teeth, and in the keenly pointed corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
red mouth when, with parted lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) somewhat
defiantly turned up her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face to argue a point with a
tall man, suggested that there was potentiality enough
in that lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of
sex, and daring enough to carry them out. But her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes
had a softness -- invariably a softness -- which, had they
not been dark, would have seemed mistiness; as they
were, it lowered an expression that might have been
piercing to simple clearness,
Strange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interlocutors to finish their state-
ments before rejoining with hers. In arguing on prices,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own firmly, as was natural in a dealer,
and reduced theirs persistently, as was inevitable in a
oman. But there was an elasticity in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) firmness
which removed it from obstinacy, as there was a naivete
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheapening which saved it from meanness.
Those of the farmers with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no dealings
by far the greater part-RRB- were continually asking each
other, ``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'' The reply would be --
``Farmer Everdene's niece; took on Weatherbury
Upper Farm; turned away the baily, and swears she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'ll do
everything herself.''
The other man would then shake his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
``Yes, `tis a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'s so headstrong.'' the first would
say. ``But we ought to be proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) here -- she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
lightens up the old place. <div class="bookquote">``Tis such a shapely maid,
however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)'ll soon get picked up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) engagement in such an occupation had almost as
much to do with the magnetism as had the beauty of
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face and movements. However, the interest was
general, and this Saturday's debut in the forum, whatever
it may have been to Bathsheba as the buying and selling
farmer, was unquestionably a triumph to her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) as the
maiden. Indeed, the sensation was so pronounced that
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) instinct on two or three occasions was merely to
walk as a queen among these gods of the fallow, like a
little sister of a little Jove, and to neglect closing prices
altogether.
The numerous evidences of-her power to attract were
only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception.
Women seem to have eyes in their ribbons for such
matters as these. Bathsheba, without looking within
a right angle of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), was conscious of a black sheep
among the flock.
It perplexed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) first. If there had been a respect-
able minority on either side, the case would have been
most natural. If nobody had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would
have -- taken the matter indifferently -- such cases had
occurred. If everybody, this man included, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would
have taken it as a matter of course -- people had done
so before. But the smallness of the exception made the
mystery.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) soon knew thus much of the recusant's appear-
ance. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a gentlemanly man, with full and
distinctly outlined Roman features, the prominences
of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like richness
of tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was erect in attitude, and quiet in
demeanour. One characteristic pre-eminently marked
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -- dignity.
Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some time ago reached that
entrance to middle age at which a man's aspect naturally
ceases to alter for the term of a dozen years or so; and,
artificially, a woman't does likewise. Thirty-five and
fifty were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limits of variation -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been
either, or anywhere between the two.
It may be said that married men of forty are usually
ready and generous enough to fling passing glances at
any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by
the way. Probably, as with persons playing whist for
love, the consciousness of a certain immunity under
any circumstances from that worst possible ultimate,
the having to pay, makes them unduly speculative.
Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person
was not a married man.
When marketing was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) rushed off to Liddy,
who was waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) -- beside the yellowing in which
they had driven to town. The horse was put in, and
on they trotted Bathsheba's sugar, tea, and drapery
parcels being packed behind, and expressing in some
indescribable manner, by their colour, shape, and
general lineaments, that they were that young lady-
farmer's property, and the grocer's and drapers no
more.
<div class="bookquote">``I've been through it, Liddy, and it is over. I shan't
mind it again, for they will all have grown accustomed
to seeing me there; but this morning it was as bad as
being married -- eyes everywhere!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knowed it would. be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy said <div class="bookquote">``Men be such
a terrible class of society to look at a body.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But there was one man who had more sense than
to waste his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time upon me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>The information was put
in this form that Liddy might not for a moment suppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mistress was at all piqued. <div class="bookquote">``A very good-looking
man.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``upright; about forty, I should
think. Do you know at all who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Liddy couldn't think.
<div class="bookquote">``Can't you guess at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba with some
disappointment.
<div class="bookquote">``I haven't a notion; besides, `tis no difference, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took less notice of you than any of the rest. Now,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d taken more, it would have mattered a great deal.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just
then, and they bowled along in silence. A low carriage,
bowling along still more rapidly behind a horse of un-
impeachable breed, overtook and passed them.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.
Liddy looked. <div class="bookquote">``That! That's Farmer Boldwood --
of course `tis -- the man you couldn't see the other day
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Farmer Boldwood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>murmured Bathsheba, and
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) outstripped them. The farmer had
never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head once, but with eyes fixed on the
most advanced point along the road, passed as uncon-
sciously and abstractedly as if Bathsheba and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charms
were thin air.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'s an interesting man -- don't you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
remarked.
<div class="bookquote">``O yes, very. Everybody owns it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>replied Liddy.
<div class="bookquote">``I wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) is so wrapt up and indifferent, and
seemingly so far away from all he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sees around him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is said -- but not known for certain -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) met

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``People always say that -- and we know very well
women scarcely ever jilt men; `tis the men who jilt us.
I expect it is simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) nature to be so reserved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) nature -- I expect so, miss -- nothing else

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Still, `tis more romantic to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) has been served

feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) must have.''
``However, we are very apt to think extremes of
people. I -- shouldn't wonder after all if it wasn't a
little of both -- just between the two -- rather cruelly
used and rather reserved.''
``O dear no, miss -- I can't think it between the

``That's most likely.''
<div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, so it is. I am convinced it is most likely.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII



<p/>SORTES SANCTORUM -- THE VALENTINE


<p/>IT was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the
thirteenth of February. Dinner being over, Bathsheba,
for want of a better companion, had asked Liddy to
come and sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The mouldy pile was dreary
in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the
shutters closed; the atmosphere of the place seemed
as old as the walls; every nook behind the furniture
had a temperature of its own, for the fire was not
kindled in this part of the house early in the day;
and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one
in other annals, looked particularly sloping and out
of level on the warped floor before night threw a
shade over its less prominent angles and hid the
unpleasantness. Liddy, like a little brook, though
shallow, was always rippling; her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) presence had not so
much weight as to task thought, and yet enough to
exercise it.
On the table lay an old quarto Bible, bound in
leather. Liddy looking at it said, --
``Did you ever find out, miss, who you are going to
marry by means of the Bible and key?,
``Don't be so foolish, Liddy. As if such things
could be.''
``Well, there's a good deal in it, all the same.''
``Nonsense, child.''
``And it makes your heart beat fearful. Some believe
in it; some don't; I do.''
``Very well, let's try it.'' said Bathsheba, bounding
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) seat with that total disregard of consistency
which can be indulged in towards a dependent, and
entering into the spirit of divination at once. ``Go and
get the front door key.''
Liddy fetched it. ``I wish it wasn't Sunday.<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
said, on returning.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Perhaps `tis wrong.''
``What's right week days is right Sundays.<div class="bookquote">'' replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
mistress in a tone which was a proof in itself.
The book was opened -- the leaves, drab with age,
being quite worn away at much-read verses by the fore''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fingers ``of unpractised readers in former days, where they
were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision.
The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out
by Bathsheba, and the sublime words met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) eye. They
slightly thrilled and abashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>). It was Wisdom in
the abstract facing Folly in the concrete. Folly in the
concrete blushed, persisted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) intention, and placed
the key on -the book. A rusty patch immediately upon
the verse, caused by previous pressure of an iron
substance thereon, told that this was not the first time
the old volume had been used for the purpose.
``Now keep steady, and be silent.'' said Bathsheba.
The `verse was repeated; the book turned round;
Bathsheba blushed guiltily.
``Who did you try?'' said Liddy curiously.
``I shall not tell you.''
``Did you notice Mr. Boldwood's doings in church
this morning, miss?``Liddy continued, adumbrating by
the remark the track her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) thoughts had taken.
``No, indeed.'' said Bathsheba, with serene indifference
``His (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) pew is exactly opposite yours, miss.''
``I know it.''
``And you did not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) goings on!,<div class="bookquote">''
Certainly I did not, I tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and shut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) lips decisively.
This move was unexpected, and proportionately dis
concerting. <div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba said perforce.
``Didn't turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) head to look at you once all the
service.
``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)?'' again demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) mistress,
wearing a nettled look. ``I didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) to.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh no. But everybody else was noticing you; and
it was odd he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) didn't. There, `tis like him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>). Rich and
gentlemanly, what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Rich</b></font>) care?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba dropped into a silence intended to ex-
press that she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) had opinions on the matter too abstruse
for Liddy's comprehension, rather than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) had
nothing to say.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear me -- I had nearly forgotten the valentine
I bought yesterday.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) exclaimed at length.
<div class="bookquote">``Valentine! who for, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy. <div class="bookquote">``Farmer
Boldwood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>all ones</b></font>)</div>It was the single name among all possible wrong
ones that just at this moment seemed to Bathsheba
more pertinent than the right.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, no. It is only for little Teddy Coggan.
have promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) something, and this will be a pretty
surprise for him (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>). Liddy, you may as well bring me
my desk and I'll direct it at once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) desk a gorgeously illumin-
ated and embossed design in post-octavo, which had
been ``bought on the previous market-day at the chief
stationer's in Casterbridge. In the centre was a small
oval enclosure; this was left blank, that the sender
might insert tender words more appropriate to the
special occasion than any generalities by a printer
could possibly be.
``Here's a place for writing.'' said Bathsheba. ``What
shall I put?''
``Something of this sort, I should think', returned
Liddy promptly: --
<div class="bookquote">``The rose is red,
The violet blue,
Carnation's sweet,
And so are you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that shall be it. It just suits itself to a chubby-
faced child like him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) inserted the
words in a small though legible handwriting; enclosed
the sheet in an envelope, and dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) pen for the
direction.
<div class="bookquote">``What fun it would be to send it to the stupid old
Boldwood, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would wonder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said the
irrepressible Liddy, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) eyebrows, and indulging
in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) thought
of the moral and social magnitude of the man contem-
plated.
Bathsheba paused to regard the idea at full length.
Boldwood's had begun to be a troublesome image -- a
species of Daniel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) kingdom who persisted in
kneeling eastward when reason and common sense
said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) might just as well follow suit with the
rest, and afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) the official glance of admiration
which cost nothing at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) was far from being
seriously concerned about his (<font color='blue'><b>Daniel</b></font>) nonconformity. Still,
it was faintly depressing that the most dignified and
valuable man in the parish should withhold his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes,
and that a girl like Liddy should talk about it. So
Liddy's idea was at first rather harassing than piquant.
<div class="bookquote">``No, I won't do that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wouldn't see any humour
in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'d worry to death.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said the persistent Liddy.
<div class="bookquote">``Really, I don't care particularly to send it to
Teddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>remarked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mistress. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>)'s rather a naughty
child sometimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's toss as men do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, idly. <div class="bookquote">``Now

money on a Sunday that would be tempting the devil

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Toss this hymn-book; there can't be no sinfulness

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Open, Boldwood -- shut, Teddy. No;

Boldwood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The book went fluttering in the air and came down shut.
Bathsheba, a small yawn upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth, took the
pen, and with off-hand serenity directed the missive to
Boldwood.
<div class="bookquote">``Now light a candle, Liddy. Which seal shall we

one with a motto -- I remember it is some funny one,
but I can't read it. We'll try this, and if it doesn't
do we'll have another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A large red seal was duly affixed. Bathsheba looked
closely at the hot wax to discover the words.
<div class="bookquote">``Capital!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed, throwing down the letter
frolicsomely. ''`Twould upset the solemnity of a parson
The same evening the letter was sent, and was duly
returned to Weatherbury again in the morning.
Of love as a spectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge;
but of love subjectively she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew nothing.




<p/>CHAPTER XIV



<p/>EFFECT OF THE LETTER -- SUNRISE


<p/>AT dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Bold-
wood sat down to supper as usual, by a beaming fire
of aged logs. Upon the mantel-shelf before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) was
a time-piece, surmounted by a spread eagle, and upon
the eagle's wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent.
Here the bachelor's gaze was continually fastening
itself, till the large red seal became as a blot of blood
on the retina of his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) eye; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) ate and drank he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)
still read in fancy the words thereon, although they
were too remote for his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) sight --
<div class="bookquote">``MARRY ME.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The pert injunction was like those crystal substances
which, colourless themselves, assume the tone of objects
about them. Here, in the quiet of Boldwood's parlour,
where everything that ,was not grave was extraneous,
and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday
lasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed''
their tenor from the thoughtlessness of their origin to
a deep solemnity, imbibed from their accessories
now.
Since the receipt of the missive in the morning,
Boldwood had felt the symmetry of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) existence to
be slowly getting distorted in the direction of an ideal
passion. The disturbance was as the first floating
weed to Columbus -- the eontemptibly little suggesting
possibilities of the infinitely great.
The letter must have had an origin and a motive.
That the latter was of the smallest magnitude com-
patible with its existence at all, Boldwood, of course,
did not know. And such an explanation did not
strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) as a possibility even. It is foreign to a
mystified condition of mind to realize of the mystifier
that the processes of approving a course suggested by
circumstance, and of striking out a course from inner
impulse, would look the same in the result. The vast
difference between starting a train of events, and direct-
ing into a particular groove a series already started, is
rarely apparent to the person confounded by the
issue.
When Boldwood went to bed he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) placed the valen-
tine in the corner of the looking-glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was
conscious of its presence, even when his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) back was
turned upon it. It was the first time in Boldwood's
life that such an event had occurred. The same
fascination that caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) to think it an act which had
a deliberate motive prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) from regarding it as
an impertinence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) looked again at the direction.
The mysterious influences of night invested the writing
with the presence of the unknown writer. Somebody's
some woman's -- hand had travelled softly over the
paper bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) name; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unrevealed eyes had
watched every curve as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) formed it; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brain had
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) in imagination the while. Why should
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mouth -- were the lips
red or pale, plump or creased? -- had curved itself to a
certain expression as the pen went on -- the corners had
moved with all their natural tremulousness: what had
been the expression?
The vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to
the words written, had no individuality. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a
misty shape, and well she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be, considering that
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) original was at that moment sound asleep and
oblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky.
Whenever Boldwood dozed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took a form, and com-
paratively ceased to be a vision: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) awoke there
was the letter justifying the dream.
The moon shone to-night, and its light was not of
a customary kind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) window admitted only a
reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen had that
reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward
and lighting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) ceiling in an unnatural way, casting
shadows in strange places, and putting lights where
shadows had used to be.
The substance of the epistle had occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) but
little in comparison with the fact of its arrival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
suddenly wondered if anything more might be found in
the envelope than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had withdrawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) jumped
out of bed in the weird light, took the letter, pulled out
the flimsy sheet, shook the envelope -- searched it.
Nothing more was there. Boldwood looked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent red
seal: ``Marry me.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said aloud.
The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the
letter, and stuck it in the frame of the glass. In doing
so he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) caught sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) reflected features, wan in
expression, and insubstantial in form. He (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) saw how
closely compressed was his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) mouth, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>) eyes
were wide-spread and vacant. Feeling uneasy and dis-
satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability, he (<font color='blue'><b>yeoman</b></font>)
returned to bed.
Then the dawn drew on. The full power of the
clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at
noon, when Boldwood arose and dressed himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of
a field to the east, leaning over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) paused and
looked around.
It was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of
the year, and the sky, pure violet in the zenith, was
leaden to the northward, and murky to the east, where,
over the snowy down or ewe-lease on Weatherbury
Upper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the
only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red
and flameless fire shining over a white hearthstone.
The whole effect resembled a sunset as childhood
resembles age.
In other directions, the fields and sky were so much
of one colour by the snow, that it was difficult in a
hasty glance to tell whereabouts the horizon occurred;
and in general there was here, too, that before-mentioned
preternatural inversion of light and shade which attends
the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in
the sky is found on the earth, and the shades of earth
are in the sky. Over the west hung the wasting moon,
now dull and greenish-yellow, like tarnished brass.
Boldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had
hardened and glazed the surface of the snow, till it
shone in the red eastern light wit-h the polish of marble;
how, in some portions of the slope, withered grass-bents,
encased in icicles, bristled through the smooth wan
coverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old
Venetian glass; and how the footprints of a few birds,
which had hopped over the snow whilst it lay in the
state of a soft fleece, were now frozen to a short perma-
nency. A half-muffled noise of light wheels interrupted
him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Boldwood turned back into the road. It was
the mail-cart -- a crazy, two-wheeled vehicle, hardly
heavy enough to resist a puff of wind. The driver held
out a letter. Boldwood seized it and opened it, ex-
pecting another anonymous one -- so greatly are people's
ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent will
repeat itself.
``I don't think it is for you, sir.'' said the man, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Boldwood's action. ``Though there is no name
I think it is for your shepherd.''
Boldwood looked then at the address --
To the New Shepherd,
Weatherbury Farm,
Near Casterbridge.
``Oh -- what a mistake! -- it is not mine. Nor is it
for my shepherd. It is for Miss Everdene's.<div class="bookquote">'' You had
better take it on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) -- Gabriel Oak -- and say I opened
it in mistake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>At this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing
sky, a figure was visible, like the black snuff in the
midst of a candle-flame. Then it moved and began to
bustle about vigorously from place to place, carrying
square skeleton masses, which were riddled by the same
rays. A small figure on all fours followed behind. The
tall form was that of Gabriel Oak; the small one that
of George; the articles in course of transit were hurdles.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood.<div class="bookquote">'' That's the man on the hill.
I'll take the letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>To Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to
I another man. It was an opportunity. Exhibiting a
face pregnant with intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the snowy field.
Gabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards
the right. The glow stretched down in this direction
now, and touched the distant roof of Warren's Malthouse
whither the shepherd was apparently bent: Boldwood
followed at a distance.




<p/>CHAPTER XV



<p/>THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did
not penetrate to its interior, which was, as usual, lighted
by a rival glow of similar hue, radiating from the hearth.
The maltster, after having lain down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) clothes
for a few hours, was now sitting beside a three-legged
table, breakfasting of bread and bacon. This was
eaten on the plateless system, which is performed by
placing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat
upon the bread, a mustard plaster upon the meat, and
a pinch of salt upon the whole, then cutting them
vertically downwards with a large pocket-knife till wood
is reached, when the severed lamp is impaled on the
knife, elevated, and sent the proper way of food.
The maltster's lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly
diminish his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) powers as a mill. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been without
them for so many years that toothlessness was felt less
to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition. Indeed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic curve
approaches a straight line -- less directly as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) got nearer,
till it was doubtful if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would ever reach it at all.
In the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting, and a
boiling pipkin of charred bread, called <div class="bookquote">``coffee.''  (<font color='red'><b>Warren/WARREN</b></font>)</div>for the
benefit of whomsoever should call, for Warren's was a
sort of clubhouse. used as an alternative to the in!
<div class="bookquote">``I say, says I, we get a fine day, and then down
comes a snapper at night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a remark now suddenly
heard spreading into the malthouse from the door, which
had been opened the previous moment. The form of
Henery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) boots when about half-way there. The speech
and entry had not seemed to be at all an abrupt begin-
ning to the maltster, introductory matter being often
omitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and
deed, and the maltster having the same latitude allowed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>), did not hurry to reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) picked up a fragment
of cheese, by pecking upon it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) knife, as a butcher
picks up skewers.
Henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat,
buttoned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) smock-frock, the white skirts of the
latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below
the coat-tails, which, when you got used to the style of
dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental -- it
certainly was comfortable.
Matthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters
and waggoners followed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) heels, with great lanterns
dangling from their hands, which showed that they had
just come from the cart-horse stables, where they had
been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.
<div class="bookquote">``And how is she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) getting on without a baily?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the
maltster inquired.
Henery shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) head, and smiled one of the bitter
smiles, dragging all the flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) forehead into a
corrugated heap in the centre.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll rue it -- surely, surely!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">'' Benjy
Pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily --
as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot himself. But to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) can carr' on alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) head to swing
laterally three or four times in silence. <div class="bookquote">``Never in all my
creeping up -- never!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was recognized by all as the conclusion of some
gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought
alone during the shake of the head; Henery meanwhile
retained several marks of despair upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) face, to
imply that they would be required for use again directly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) should go on speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``All will be ruined, and ourselves too, or there's no
meat in gentlemen's houses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark Clark/Mr. Clark/Mr. Mark Clark</b></font>)</div>said Mark Clark.
<div class="bookquote">``A headstrong maid, that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) is -- and won't
listen to no advice at all. Pride and vanity have ruined
many a cobbler's dog. Dear, dear, when I think o' it,
I sorrows like a man in travel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True, Henery, you do, I've heard ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph
Poorgrass in a voice of thorough attestation, and with
a wire-drawn smile of misery.
<div class="bookquote">''`Twould do a martel man no harm to have what's
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Iscariot</b></font>) bonnet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Billy Smallbury, who had just
entered, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) one tooth before him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) can
spaik real language, and must have some sense some-
where. Do ye foller me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do: but no baily -- I deserved that place.''  (<font color='red'><b>genius</b></font>)</div>wailed
Henery, signifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at
visions of a high destiny apparently visible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) on
Billy Smallbury's smock-frock. <div class="bookquote">``There, 'twas to be, I
suppose. Your lot is your lot, and Scripture is nothing;
for if you do good you don't get rewarded according to
your works, but be cheated in some mean way out of
your recompense.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I don't agree with`ee there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark Clark/Mr. Clark/Mr. Mark Clark</b></font>)</div>said Mark
Clark. God's a perfect gentleman in that respect.''
``Good works good pay, so to speak it.'' attested
Joseph Poorgrass.
A short pause ensued, and as a sort of entr`acte
Henery turned and blew out the lanterns, which the
increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even
in the malthouse, with its one pane of glass.
``I wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a
harpsichord, dulcimer, pianner, or whatever `tis they d'call
it?'' said the maltster. ``Liddy saith she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ve a new one.''
``Got a pianner?''
``Ay. Seems her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) old uncle's things were not good
enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'ve bought all but everything new.
There's heavy chairs for the stout, weak and wiry ones
for the slender; great watches, getting on to the size
of clocks, to stand upon the chimbley-piece.<div class="bookquote">''
Pictures, for the most part wonderful frames.''
 (<font color='red'><b>ones</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And long horse-hair settles for the drunk, with horse-
hair pillows at each end.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark Clark/Mr. Clark/Mr. Mark Clark</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Clark. <div class="bookquote">``Likewise
looking-glasses for the pretty, and lying books for the
wicked.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside;
the door was opened about six inches, and somebody on
the other side exclaimed --
``Neighbours, have ye got room for a few new-born
lambs?``Ay, sure, shepherd.'' said the conclave.
The door was flung back till it kicked the wall and
trembled from top to bottom with the blow. Mr.
Oak appeared in the entry with a steaming face, hay-
bands wound about his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) ankles to keep out the snow, a
leather strap round his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) waist outside the smock-frock,
and looking altogether an epitome of the world's health
and vigour. Four lambs hung in various embarrassing
attitudes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) shoulders, and the dog George, whom
Gabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe, stalked
solemnly behind.
``Well, Shepherd Oak, and how's lambing this year,
if I mid say it?'' inquired Joseph Poorgrass.
``Terrible trying,'' said Oak. ``I've been wet through
twice a-day, either in snow or rain, this last fortnight.
Cainy and I haven't tined our eyes to-night.''
``A good few twins, too, I hear?''
``Too many by half. Yes; `tis a very queer lambing
this year. We shan't have done by Lady Day.''
``And last year `twer all over by Sexajessamine
Sunday.'' Joseph remarked.
``Bring on the rest Cain.<div class="bookquote">'' said Gabriel, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>and then run
back to the ewes. I'll follow you soon.''
Cainy Ball -- a cheery-faced young lad, with a small
circular orifice by way of mouth, advanced and deposited
two others, and retired as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was bidden. Oak lowered
the lambs from their unnatural elevation, wrapped them
in hay, and placed them round the fire.
``We've no lambing-hut here, as I used to have at
Norcombe.<div class="bookquote">'' said Gabriel, ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and `tis such a plague to bring
the weakly ones to a house. If 'twasn't for your place
here, malter, I don't know what I should do! this keen
weather. And how is it with you to-day, malter?''
``Oh, neither sick nor sorry, shepherd, but no
younger.''
``Ay -- I understand.''
``Sit down, Shepherd Oak,'' continued the ancient man
of malt. ``And how was the old place at Norcombe,
when ye went for your dog? I should like to see the
old familiar spot; but faith, I shouldn't<div class="bookquote">'' know a soul
there now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``I suppose you wouldn't. ``Tis altered very much.''
``Is it true that Dicky Hill's wooden cider-house is
pulled down?''
``O yes -- years ago, and Dicky's cottage just above it.''
``Well, to be sure!,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; and Tompkins's old apple-tree is rooted that
used to bear two hogsheads of cider; and no help from
other trees.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rooted? -- you don't say it! Ah! stirring times we
live in -- stirring times.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And you can mind the old well that used to be in
the middle of the place? That's turned into a solid
iron pump with a large stone trough, and all complete.''
``Dear, dear -- how the face of nations alter, and
what we live to see nowadays! Yes -- and `tis the same
here. They've been talking but now of the mis`ess's
strange doings.''
``What have you been saying about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?'' inquired
Oak, sharply turning to the rest, and getting very
warm.
``These middle-aged men have been pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) over
the coals for pride and vanity.'' said Mark Clark; ``but
I say, let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) have rope enough. Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pretty face
shouldn't I like to do so -- upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cherry lips!''
The gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well
known sound with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) own.
``Mark.'' said Gabriel, sternly, ``now you mind this!
none of that dalliance-talk -- that smack-and-coddle style
of yours -- about Miss Everdene. I don't allow it. Do
you hear? ''
``With all my heart, as I've got no chance.'' replied
Mr. Clark, cordially.
``I suppose you've been speaking against her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?'' said
Oak, turning to Joseph Poorgrass with a very grim
look.
``No, no -- not a word I -- `tis a real joyful thing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s no worse, that's what I say.'' said Joseph, trembling
and blushing with terror. ``Matthew just said -- -- ''
``Matthew Moon, what have you been saying?'' asked
Oak.
``I? Why ye know I wouldn't harm a worm -- no,
not one underground worm?'' said Matthew Moon,
looking very uneasy.
``Well, somebody has -- and look here, neighbours.''
Gabriel, though one of the quietest and most gentle
men on earth, rose to the occasion, with martial
promptness and vigour. ``That's my fist.'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) fist, rather smaller in size than a common
loaf, in the mathemarical centre of the maltster's little
table, and with it gave a bump or two thereon, as if
to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the
idea of fistiness before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went further. ``Now -- the
first man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of
our mistress, why'' -LRB-here the fist was raised and let fall
as T'hor might have done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hammer in assaying
it-RRB- -- ``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll smell and taste that -- or I'm a Dutchman.''
All earnestly expressed by their features that their
minds did not wander to Holland for a moment on
account of this statement, but were deploring the
difference which gave rise to the figure; and Mark
Clark cried ``Hear, hear; just what I should ha' said.''
The dog George looked up at the same time after the
shepherd's menace, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) understood English
but imperfectly, began to growl.
``Now, don't ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!''
said Henery, with a deprecating peacefulness equal to
anything of the kind in Christianity.
``We hear that ye be a extraordinary good and
clever man, shepherd.<div class="bookquote">'' said Joseph Poorgrass with
considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed-
stead whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) had retired for safety. '' (<font color='red'><b>shepherd</b></font>)</div>`Tis a great
thing to be clever, I'm sure.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) added, making move-
ments associated with states of mind rather than body;
``we wish we were, don't we, neighbours?''
``Ay, that we do, sure.'' said Matthew Moon, with
a small anxious laugh towards Oak, to show how very
friendly disposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) was likewise.
``Who's been telling you I'm clever?<div class="bookquote">'' said Oak.
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`Tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common,''
said Matthew. ``We hear that ye can tell the time as
well by the stars as we can by the sun and moon,
shepherd.''
``Yes, I can do a little that way.<div class="bookquote">'' said Gabriel, as a
man of medium sentiments on the subject.
names upon their waggons almost like copper-plate,
with beautiful flourishes, and great long tails. A
excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man,
shepherd. Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer
James Everdene's waggons before you came, and 'a
could never mind which way to turn the J's and E's
-- could ye, Joseph?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Joseph shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) head to express
how absolute was the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) couldn't. <div class="bookquote">``And so
you used to do 'em the wrong way, like this, didn't ye,
Joseph?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>Matthew marked on the dusty floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)
whip-handle.
<div class="bookquote">``And how Farmer James would cuss, and call thee a
fool, wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), Joseph, when 'a seed his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) name
looking so inside-out-like?''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>continued Matthew Moon
with feeling.
<div class="bookquote">``Ay -- 'a would.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, meekly. <div class="bookquote">``But, you see,
I wasn't so much to blame, for them J's and E's be
such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind
whether they face backward or forward; and I always
had such a forgetful memory, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a bad afiction for ye, being such a man of
calamities in other ways.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, `tis; but a happy Providence ordered that it
should be no worse, and I feel my thanks. As to
shepherd, there, I'm sure mis`ess ought to have made
ye her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) baily -- such a fitting man for't as you be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind owning that I expected it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak,
frankly.<div class="bookquote">'' Indeed, I hoped for the place. At the same
time, Miss Everdene has a right to be own baily if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) choose -- and to keep me down to be a common
shepherd only.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak drew a slow breath, looked sadly
into the bright ashpit, and seemed lost in thoughts not
of the most hopeful hue.
The genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate
the nearly lifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs
briskly upon the hay, and to recognize for the first time
the fact that they were born. Their noise increased to a
chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the milk-can from
before the fire, and taking a small tea-pot from the pocket
of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) smock-frock, filled it with milk, and taught those of
the helpless creatures which were not to be restored to
their dams how to drink from the spout -- a trick they
acquired with astonishing aptitude.
<div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) don't even let ye have the skins of the
dead lambs, I hear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>resumed Joseph Poorgrass, his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>)
eyes lingering on the operations of Oak with the neces-
sary melancholy.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't have them.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Ye be very badly used, shepherd.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>hazarded Joseph
again, in the hope of getting Oak as an ally in lamenta-
tion after all. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s took against ye -- that
I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no -- not at all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>replied Gabriel, hastily, and a
sigh escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), which the deprivation of lamb skins
could hardly have caused.
Before any further remark had been added a shade
darkened the door, and Boldwood entered the malthouse,
bestowing upon each a nod of a quality between friendli-
ness and condescension.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah! Oak, I thought you were here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I
met the mail-cart ten minutes ago, and a letter was put
into my hand, which I opened without reading the
address. I believe it is yours. You must excuse the
accident please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes -- not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood --
not a bit.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, readily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had not a corre-
spondent on earth, nor was there a possible letter coming
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) whose contents the whole parish would not have
been welcome to persue.
Oak stepped aside, and read the following in an
unknown hand: --
``DEAR FRIEND, -- I do not know your name, but l think
these few lines will reach you, which I wrote to thank you
for your kindness to me the night I left Weatherbury in a
reckless way. I also return the money I owe you, which
you will excuse my not keeping as a gift. All has ended
well, and I am happy to say I am going to be married to
the young man who has courted me for some time -- Sergeant
Troy, of the 11th Dragoon Guards, now quartered in this
town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) would, I know, object to my having received
anything except as a loan, being a man of great respecta-
bility and high honour -- indeed, a nobleman by blood.
``I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the
contents of this letter a secret for the present, dear friend.
We mean to surprise Weatherbury by coming there soon
as husband and wife, though l blush to state it to one nearly
a stranger. The sergeant grew up in Weatherbury. Thank-
ing you again for your kindness,
``I am, your sincere well-wisher,
``FANNY ROBIN.''
``Have you read it, Mr. Boldwood?'' said Gabriel;
``if not, you had better do so. I know you are interested
in Fanny Robin.''
Boldwood read the letter and looked grieved.
``Fanny -- poor Fanny! the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is so confident
of has not yet come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should remember -- and may
never come. I see she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gives no address.''
``What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?'' said
Gabriel.
``H'm -- I'm afraid not one to build much hope upon
in such a case as this.'' the farmer murmured, ``though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)'s a clever fellow, and up to everything. A slight
romance attaches to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>), too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) mother was a French
governess, and it seems that a secret attachment existed
between her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and the late Lord Severn. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was married
to a poor medical man, and soon after an infant was
horn; and while money was forthcoming all went on
well. Unfortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) best friends died;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's
in Casterbridge. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stayed there for some time, and
might have worked himself into a dignified position of
some sort had he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not indulged in the wild freak of
enlisting. I have much doubt if ever little Fanny will
surprise us in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mentions -- very much doubt
A silly girl! -- silly girl!''
The door was hurriedly burst open again, and in
came running Cainy Ball out of breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mouth red
and open, like the bell of a penny trumpet, from which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face.
``Now, Cain Ball.'' said Oak, sternly, ``why will you
run so fast and lose your breath so? I'm always telling
you of it.''
``Oh -- I -- a puff of mee breath -- went -- the -- wrong
way, please, Mister Oak, and made me cough -- hok --
hok!''
``Well -- what have you come for?''
``I've run to tell ye.<div class="bookquote">'' said the junior shepherd,
supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) exhausted youthful frame against the
doorpost,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that you must come directly'. Two more ewes
have twinned -- that's what's the matter, Shepherd Oak.''
``Oh, that's it.'' said Oak, jumping up, and dimissing
for the present his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) thoughts on poor Fanny. ``You are
a good boy to run and tell me, Cain, and you shall
smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat. But,
before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we'll mark
this lot and have done with 'em.''
Oak took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) illimitable pockets a marking iron,
dipped it into the pot, and imprintcd on the buttocks
of the infant sheep the initials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) delighted to
muse on -- ``B. E..'' which signified to all the region
round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer
Bathsheba Everdene, and to no one else.
``Now, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off Good
morning, Mr. Boldwood.'' The shepherd lifted the
sixteen large legs and four small bodies he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) had himself
brought, and vanished with them in the direction of
the lambing field hard by -- their frames being now in a
sleek and hopeful state, pleasantly contrasting with their
death's-door plight of half an hour before.
Boldwood followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) a little way up the field,
hesitated, and turned back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) again
with a last resolve, annihilating return. On approaching
the nook in which the fold was constructed, the farmer
drew out-his pocket-book, unfastened-it, and allowed it
to lie open on his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hand. A letter was revealed -- Bath-
sheba's.
``I was going to ask you, Oak.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said, with unreal
carelessness, ``if you know whose writing this is? <div class="bookquote">''
Oak glanced into the book, and replied instantly,
with a flushed face, ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Everdene's.<div class="bookquote">''
Oak had coloured simply at the consciousness of
sounding her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) name. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) now felt a strangely distressing
qualm from a new thought.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The letter could of course
be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry would not
have been necessary.
Boldwood mistook his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) confusion: sensitive persons
are always ready with their <div class="bookquote">``Is it I?''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>in preference to
objective reasoning.
<div class="bookquote">``The question was perfectly fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) returned -- and
there was something incongruous in the serious earnest-
ness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) applied himself to an argument on
a valentine. <div class="bookquote">``You know it is always expected that
privy inquiries will be made: that's where the -- fun
lies.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>If the word <div class="bookquote">``fun''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had been <div class="bookquote">``torture.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>it could
not have been uttered with a more constrained and
restless countenance than was Boldwood's then.''
Soon parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved
man returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) house to breakfast -- feeling twinges
of shame and regret at having so far exposed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mood
by those fevered questions to a stranger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) again
placed the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to
think of the circumstances attending it by the light of
Gabriel's information.




<p/>CHAPTER XVI



<p/>ALL SAINTS' AND ALL SOULS'


<p/>ON a week-day morning a small congregation, con-
sisting mainly of women and girls, rose from its knees
in the mouldy nave of a church called All Saints', in
the distant barrack-town before mentioned, at the end
of a service without a sermon. They were about to
disperse, when a smart footstep, entering the porch and
coming up the central passage, arrested their attention.
The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church; it
was the clink of spurs. Everybody looked. A young
cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons
of a sergeant upon his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) sleeve, strode up the aisle, with
an embarrassment which was only the more marked
by the intense vigour of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) step, and by the deter-
mination upon his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face to show none. A slight flush
had mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) cheek by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had run the
gauntlet between these women; but, passing on through
the chancel arch, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) never paused till he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) came close
to the altar railing. Here for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) stood
alone.
The officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
surplice, perceived the new-comer, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
to the communion-space. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) whispered to the soldier,
and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) turn
whispered to an elderly woman, apparently his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) wife, and
they also went up the chancel steps.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis a wedding!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>murmured some of the women,
brightening. <div class="bookquote">``Let's wait!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The majority</b></font>)</div>The majority again sat down.
There was a creaking of machinery behind, and
some of the young ones turned their heads. From the
interior face of the west wall of the tower projected a
little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bell beneath
it, the automaton being driven by the same clock
machinery that struck the large bell in the tower. Be-
tween the tower and the church was a close screen, the
door of which was kept shut during services, hiding
this grotesque clockwork from sight. At present, how-
ever, the door was open, and the egress of the jack, the
blows on the bell, and the mannikin's retreat into.the
nook again, were visible to many, and audible through-
out the church.
The jack had struck half-past eleven.
<div class="bookquote">``Where's the woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>the spectators</b></font>)</div>whispered some of the
spectators.
The young sergeant stood still with the abnormal
rigidity of the old pillars around. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) faced the south-
east, and was as silent as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was still.
The silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the
minutes went on, and nobody else appeared, and not a
soul moved. The rattle of the quarter-jack again from
its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its fussy retreat,
were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the
congregation to start palpably.
<div class="bookquote">``I wonder where the woman is!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a voice whispered
again.
There began now that slight shifting of feet, that
artificial coughing among several, which betrays a
nervous suspense. At length there was a titter. But
the soldier never moved. There he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) stood, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) face to
the south-east, upright as a column, his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) cap in his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) hand.
The clock ticked on. The women threw off their
nervousness, and titters and giggling became more
frequent. Then came a dead silence. Every one was
waiting for the end. Some persons may have noticed
how extraordinarily the striking of quarters. seems to
quicken the flight of time. It was hardly credible that
the jack had not got wrong with the minutes when the
rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the four
quarters were struck fitfully as before: One could al-
most be positive that there was a malicious leer upon
the hideous creature's face, and a mischievous delight
in its twitchings. Then, followed the dull and remote
resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower
above. The women were impressed, and there was no
giggle this time.
The clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk
vanished. The sergeant had not yet turned; every
woman in the church was waiting to see his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) appeared to know it. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) did turn, and
stalked resolutely down the nave, braving them all,
with a compressed lip. Two bowed and toothless old
almsmen then looked at each other and chuckled,
innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird
effect in that place.
Opposite to the church was a paved square, around
which several overhanging wood buildings of old time
cast a picturesque shade. The young man on leaving
the door went to cross the square, when, in the middle,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) met a little woman. The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face,
which had been one of intense anxiety, sank at the
sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nearly to terror.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``O, Frank -- I made a mistake! -- I thought that
church with the spire was All Saints', and I was at the
door at half-past eleven to a minute as you said.
waited till a quarter to twelve, and found then that I
was in All Souls'. But I wasn't much frightened, for
I thought it could be to-morrow as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You fool, for so fooling me! But say no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shall it be to-morrow, Frank?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked blankly.
<div class="bookquote">``To-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave vent to a hoarse laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't go through that experience again for some
time, I warrant you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) expostulated in a trembling voice,
<div class="bookquote">``the mistake was not such a terrible thing! Now, dear
Frank, when shall it be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, when? God knows!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with a light
irony, and turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked rapidly away.




<p/>CHAPTER XVII



<p/>IN THE MARKET-PLACE


<p/>ON Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market
house as usual, when the disturber of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) dreams entered
and became visible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). Adam had awakened from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) deep sleep, and behold! there was Eve. The
farmer took courage, and for the first time really looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Material causes and emotional effects are not to be
arranged in regular equation. The result from capital
employed in the production of any movement of a
mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause
itself is absurdly minute. When women are in a freakish
mood, their usual intuition, either from carelessness or
inherent defect, seemingly fails to teach them this, and
hence it was that Bathsheba was fated to be astonished
today.
Boldwood looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -- not slily, critically, or
understandingly, but blankly at gaze, in the way a
reaper looks up at a passing train -- as something foreign
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) element, and but dimly understood. To Bold-
wood women had been remote phenomena rather than
necessary complements -- comets of such uncertain
aspect, movement, and permanence, that whether
their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and
as subject to laws as his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own, or as absolutely erratic
as they superficially appeared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had not deemed it
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) duty to consider.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) black hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) correct facial curves
and profile, and the roundness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) chin and throat.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) saw then the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eyelids, eyes, and lashes,
and the shape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) ear. Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) figure,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) skirt, and the very soles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) shoes.
Boldwood thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) beautiful, but wondered
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thought, for it seemed
impossible that this romance in the flesh, if so sweet
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) imagined, could have been going on long without
creating a commotion of delight among men, and pro-
voking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done, even
though that was not a little. To the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) judge-
ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect
one of an imperfect many. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heart began to move
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). Boldwood, it must be remembered, though
forty years of age, had never before inspected a woman
with the very centre and force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) glance; they had
struck upon all his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) senses at wide angles.
Was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really beautiful? He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could not assure
himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) opinion was true even now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) fur-
tively said to a neighbour, <div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Everdene considered
handsome?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a neighbour</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was a good deal noticed the first
time she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came, if you remember. A very handsome
girl indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>A man is never more credulous than in receiving
favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
half, or quite, in love with; a mere child's word on the
point has the weight of an R.A.``s. Boldwood was
satisfied now.
And this charming woman had in effect said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), ``Marry me.'' Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have done that
strange thing? Boldwood's blindness to the difference
between approving of what circumstances suggest, and
originating what they do not suggest, was well matched
by Bathsheba's insensibility to the possibly great issues
of little beginnings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing
young farmer, adding up accounts with him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) as indiffer-
ently as if his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) face had been the pages of a ledger. It
was evident that such a nature as his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had no attraction
for a woman of Bathsheba's taste. But Boldwood grew
hot down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hands with an incipient jealousy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
trod for the first time the threshold of <div class="bookquote">``the injured
lover's hell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) first impulse was to go and thrust
himself between them. This could be done, but only
in one way -- by asking to see a sample of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) corn.
Boldwood renounced the idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could not make
the request; it was debasing loveliness to ask it to
buy and sell, and jarred with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) conceptions of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
All this time Bathsheba was conscious of having
broken into that dignified stronghold at last. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew, were following her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everywhere. This
was a triumph; and had it come naturally, such a
triumph would have been the sweeter to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for this
piquing delay. But it had been brought about by
misdirected ingenuity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) valued it only as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit.
Being a woman with some good sense in reasoning
on subjects wherein her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was not involved, Bath-
sheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed
its existence as much to Liddy as to herself, should
ever have been undertaken, to disturb the placidity of
a man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) respected too highly to deliberately tease.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that day nearly formed the intention of begging
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pardon on the very next occasion of their meeting.
The worst features of this arrangement were that, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ridiculed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), an apology would in-
crease the offence by being disbelieved; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), it would read
like additional evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forwardness.




<p/>CHAPTER XVIII



<p/>BOLDWOOD IN MEDITATION -- REGRET


<p/>BOLDWOOD was tenant of what was called Little
Weatherbury Farm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>BOLDWOOD</b></font>) person was the nearest ap-
proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the
parish could boast of. Genteel strangers, whose god
was their town, who might happen to be compelled to
linger about this nook for a day, heard the sound of
light wheels, and prayed to see good society, to the
degree of a solitary lord, or squire at the very least,
but it was only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day.
They heard the sound of wheels yet once more, and
were re-animated to expectancy: it was only Mr. Bold-
wood coming home again.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) house stood recessed from the road, and the
stables, which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a
room, were behind, their lower portions being lost
amid bushes of laurel. Inside the blue door, open
half-way down, were to be seen at this time the backs
and tails of half-a-dozen warm and contented horses
standing in their stalls; and as thus viewed, they pre-
sented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a
Moorish arch, the tail being a streak down the midst
of each. Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in
from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals
could be heard busily sustaining the above-named
warmth and plumpness by quantities of oats and hay.
The restless and shadowy figure of a colt wandered
about a loose-box at the end, whilst the steady grind
of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the
rattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot.
Pacing up and down at the heels of the animals was
Farmer Boldwood himself. This place was his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) almonry
and cloister in one: here, after looking to the feeding
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) four-footed dependants, the celibate would walk
and meditate of an evening till the moon's rays streamed
in through the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness
enveloped the scene.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully
now than in the crowd and bustle of the market-house.
In this meditative walk his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) foot met the floor with heel
and toe simultaneously, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) fine reddish-fleshed face
was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent
and broad chin. A few clear and thread-like horizontal
lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth
surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) large forehead.
The phases of Boldwood's life were ordinary enough,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was not an ordinary nature. That stillness,
which struck casual observers more than anything else
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) character and habit, and seemed so precisely
like the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect
balance of enormous antagonistic forces -- positives and
negatives in fine adjustment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) equilibrium disturbed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was in extremity at once. If an emotion possessed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) at all, it ruled him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); a feeling not mastering him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
was entirely latent. Stagnant or rapid, it was never
slow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was always hit mortally, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was missed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had no light and careless touches in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) constitu-
tion, either for good or for evil. Stern in the outlines of
action, mild in the details, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was serious throughout all.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) saw no absurd sides to the follies of life, and thus,
though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry
men and scoffers, and those to whom all things show
life as a jest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stern</b></font>) was not intolerable to the earnest and
those acquainted with grief. Being a man -who read
all the dramas of life seriously, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed to please
when they were comedies, there was no frivolous treat-
ment to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for when they chanced to end
tragically.
Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and
silent shape upon which she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had so carelessly thrown a
seed was a hotbed of tropic intensity. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) known
Boldwood's moods, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blame would have been fearful,
and the stain upon her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart ineradicable. Moreover,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) known her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present power for good or evil over
this man, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have trembled at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responsibility.
Luckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present, unluckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future tran-
quillity, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understanding had not yet told her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what
Boldwood was. Nobody knew entirely; for though it
was possible to form guesses concerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wild capa-
bilities from old floodmarks faintly visible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had never
been seen at the high tides which caused them.
Farmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked
forth across the level fields. Beyond the first enclosure
was a hedge, and on the other side of this a meadow
belonging to Bathsheba's farm.
It was now early spring -- the time of going to grass
with the sheep, when they have the first feed of the
meadows, before these are laid up for mowing. The
wind, which had been blowing east for several weeks,
had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring
had come abruptly -- almost without a beginning. It
was that period in the vernal quarter when we map
suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season. The
vegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps
to rise, till in the completest silence of lone gardens
and trackless plantations, where- everything seems -help-
less and still after the bond and slavery of frost, there
are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and pulls-all-
together, in comparison with which the powerful tugs of
cranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts.
Boldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw
there three figures. They were those of Miss Everdene,
Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.
When Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's
eyes it lighted him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) up as the moon lights up a great
tower. A man's body is as the shell; or the tablet, of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or
self-contained. There was a change in Boldwood's
exterior from its former impassibleness; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face
showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now living outside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) defences
for the first time, and with a fearful sense of exposure.
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
love.
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrived at a conclusion. It was to go
across and inquire boldly of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
The insulation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart by reserve during these
many years, without a channel of any kind for disposable
emotion, had worked its effect. It has been observed
more than once that the causes of love are chiefly
subjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to
the truth of the proposition. No mother existed to
absorb his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) devotion, no sister for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) tenderness, no
idle ties for sense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) became surcharged with the
compound, which was genuine lover's love.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) approached the gate of the meadow. Beyond
it the ground was melodious with ripples, and the sky
with larks; the low bleating of the flock mingling with
both. Mistress and man were engaged in the operation
of making a lamb <div class="bookquote">``take.''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>which is performed whenever
an ewe has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) own offspring, one of the twins of
another ewe being given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) as a substitute. Gabriel
had skinned the dead lamb, and was tying the skin
over the body of the live lamb, in the customary manner,
whilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four
hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were
driven, where they would remain till the old sheep
conceived an affection for the young one.
Bathsheba looked up at the completion of the
manouvre, and saw the farmer by the gate, where he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>)
was overhung by a willow tree in full bloom. Gabriel,
to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) face was as the uncertain glory of an April
day, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and
instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence
from without, in the form of a keenly self-conscious
reddening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) also turned and beheld Boldwood.
At onee connecting these signs with the letter Bold-
wood had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), Gabriel suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) of some
coquettish procedure begun by that means, and carried
on since, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) knew not how.
Farmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting
that they were aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) presence, and the perception
was as too much light turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) new sensibility.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was still in the road, and by moving on he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hoped
that neither would recognize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had originally
intended to enter the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) passed by with an
utter and overwhelming sensation of ignorance, shyness,
and doubt. Perhaps in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) manner there were signs
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) -- perhaps not -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could not
read a woman. The cabala of this erotic philosophy
seemed to consist of the subtlest meanings expressed in
misleading ways. Every turn, look, word, and accent
contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
import, and not one had ever been pondered by him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
until now.
As for Bathsheba, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was not deceived into the
belief that Farmer Boldwood had walked by on business
or in idleness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) collected the probabilities of the
case, and concluded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was herself responsible for
Boldwood's appearance there. It troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) much
to see what a great flame a little Wildfire was likely to
kindle. Bathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) deliberately a trifler with the affections of men,
and a censor's experience on seeing an actual flirt after
observing her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) would have been a feeling of surprise
that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one,
and yet so like what a flirt is supposed to be.
She (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) resolved never again, by look or by sign, to
interrupt the steady flow of this man's life. But a
resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed till the evil
is so far advanced as to make avoidance impossible.




<p/>CHAPTER XIX



<p/>THE SHEEP-WASHING -- THE OFFER


<p/>BOLDWOOD did eventually call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>flirt</b></font>) was
not at home. <div class="bookquote">``Of course not.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>BOLDWOOD</b></font>) murmured. In con-
templating Bathsheba as a woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>BOLDWOOD</b></font>) had forgotten the
accidents of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position as an agriculturist -- that being
as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as
himself, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) probable whereabouts was out-of-doors at
this time of the year. This, and the other oversights
Boldwood was guilty of, were natural to the mood, and
still more natural to the circumstances. The great aids
to idealization in love were present here: occasional
observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from a distance, and the absence of
social intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -- visual familiarity, oral
strangeness. The smaller human elements were kept
out of sight; the pettinesses that enter so largely into
all earthly living and doing were disguised by the
accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting
terms; and there was hardly awakened a thought in
Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), like all others, had moments of
commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be
most prettily remembered. Thus a mild sort of
apotheosis took place in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fancy, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still lived
and breathed within his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own horizon, a troubled creature
like himself.
It was the end of May when the farmer determined
to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or distracted by
suspense. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had by this time grown used to being in
love; the passion now startled him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) less even when it
tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) felt himself adequate to the
situation. On inquiring for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house they had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at the sheepwashing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) went off
to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) there.
The sheep-washing pool was a perfectly circular basin
of brickwork in the meadows, full of the clearest water.
To birds on the wing its glassy surface, reflecting the
light sky, must have been visible for miles around as a
glistening Cyclops' eye in a green face. The grass
about the margin at this season was a sight to remember
long -- in a minor sort of way. Its activity in sucking
the moisture from the rich damp sod. was almost a pro-
cess observable by the eye. The outskirts of this level
water-meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow
pastures, where just now every flower that was not a
buttercup was a daisy. The river slid along noiselessly
as a shade, the swelling reeds and sedge forming a
flexible palisade upon its moist brink. To the north
of the mead were trees, the leaves of which were new,
soft, and moist, not yet having stiffened and darkened
under summer sun and drought, their colour being
yellow beside a green -- green beside a yellow.
From the recesses of this knot of foliage the loud
notes of three cuckoos were resounding through the
still air.
Boldwood went meditating down the slopes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) boots, which the yellow pollen from the
buttercups had bronzed in artistic gradations. A tribu-
tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the
pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its
diameter. Shepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poor-
grass, Cain Ball, and several others were assembled
here, all dripping wet to the very roots of their hair,
and Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding-habit --
the most elegant she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had ever worn -- the reins of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
horse being looped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) arm. Flagons of cider
were rolling about upon the green. The meek sheep
were pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew
Moon, who stood by the lower hatch, immersed to their
waists; then Gabriel, who stood on the brink, thrust
them under as they swam along, with an instrument
like a crutch, formed for the purpose, and also for
assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became
saturated and they began to sink. They were let out
against the stream, and through the upper opening, all
impurities flowing away below. Cainy Ball and Joseph,
who performed this latter operation, were if possible
wetter than the rest; they resembled dolphins under a
fountain, every protuberance and angle of their clothes
dribbling forth a small rill.
Boldwood came close and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) good-morning, with
such constraint that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) could not but think he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had
stepped across to the washing for its own sake, hoping
not to find her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) there; more, she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) fancied his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) brow severe
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eye slighting. Bathsheba immediately contrived
to withdraw, and glided along by the river till she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was
a stone's throw off. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) heard footsteps brushing the
grass, and had a consciousness that love was encircling
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) like a perfume. Instead of turning or waiting,
Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but
Boldwood seemed determined, and pressed on till they
were completely past the bend of the river. Here,
without being seen, they could hear the splashing and
shouts of the washers above.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Everdene!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer.
She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) trembled, turned, and said <div class="bookquote">``Good morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) tone was so utterly removed from all she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had
expected as a beginning. It was lowness and quiet
accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their form,
at the same time, being scarcely expressed. Silence
has sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as
the disembodied soul of feeling wandering without its
carcase, and it is then more impressive than speech.
In the same way, to say a little is often to tell more
than to say a great deal. Boldwood told everything in
that word.
As the consciousness expands on learning that what
was fancied to be the rumble of wheels is the reverbera-
tion of thunder, so did Bathsheba's at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) intuitive
conviction.
<div class="bookquote">``I feel -- almost too much -- to think.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said, with a
solemn simplicity. <div class="bookquote">``I have come to speak to you with-
out preface. My life is not my own since I have beheld
you clearly, Miss Everdene -- I come to make you an
offer of marriage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral
countenance, and all the motion she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made was that of
closing lips which had previously been a little parted.
<div class="bookquote">``I am now forty-one years old.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I may
have been called a confirmed bachelor, and I was a
confirmed bachelor. I had never any views of myself
as a husband in my earlier days, nor have I made any
calculation on the subject since I have been older.
But we all change, and my change, in this matter, came
with seeing you. I have felt lately, more and more,
that my present way of living is bad in every respect.
Beyond all things, I want you as my wife.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I feel, Mr. Boldwood, that though I respect you
much, I do not feel -- what would justify me to -- in
accepting your offer.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stammered.
This giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to
open the sluices of feeling that Boldwood had as yet
kept closed.
<div class="bookquote">``My life is a burden without you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) exclaimed, in
a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I want you -- I want you to let me say
I love you again and again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba answered nothing, and the mare upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) arm seemed so impressed that instead of cropping
the herbage she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) looked up.
<div class="bookquote">``I think and hope you care enough for me to listen
to what I have to tell!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was
to ask why he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thought that, till she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) remembered that,
far from being a conceited assumption on Boldwood's
part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec-
tion based on deceptive premises of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) own offering.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could say courteous flatteries to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>the
farmer continued in an easier tone, <div class="bookquote">'' and put my rugged
feeling into a graceful shape: but I have neither power
nor patience to learn such things. I want you for my
wife -- so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me;
but I should not have spoken out had I not been led
to hope.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>The valentine again! O that valentine!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
said to herself, but not a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>).
``If you can love me say so, Miss Everdene. If not
-- don't say no!''
``Mr. Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am
surprised, so that I don't know how to answer you with
propriety and respect -- but am only just able to speak
out my feeling -- I mean my meaning; that I am afraid
I can't marry you, much as I respect you. You are too
dignified for me to suit you, sir.''
``But, Miss Everdene!''
``I -- I didn't -- I know I ought never to have dreamt
of sending that valentine -- forgive me, sir -- it was a
wanton thing which no woman with any self-respect
should have done. If you will only pardon my thought-
lessness, I promise never to -- -- ''
``No, no, no. Don't say thoughtlessness! Make me
think it was something more -- that it was a sort of
prophetic instinct -- the beginning of a feeling that you
would like me. You torture me to say it was done in
thoughtlessness -- I never thought of it in that light, and
I can't endure it. Ah! I wish I knew how to win you!
but that I can't do -- I can only ask if I have already got
you. If I have not, and it is not true that you have
come unwittingly to me as I have to you, I can say no
more.''
``I have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood --
certainly I must say that.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) allowed a very small
smile to creep for the first time over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) serious face in
saying this, and the white row of upper teeth, and keenly-
cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of heartless-
ness, which was immediately contradicted by the pleasant
eyes.
``But you will just think -- in kindness and conde-
scension think -- if you cannot bear with me as a husband!
I fear I am too old for you, but believe me I will take
more care of you than would many a man of your own
age. I will protect and cherish you with all my strength
-- I will indeed! You shall have no cares -- be worried
by no household affairs, and live quite at ease, Miss
Everdene. The dairy superintendence shall be done by
a man -- I can afford it will -- you shall never have so
much as to look out of doors at haymaking time, or to
think of weather in the harvest. I rather cling; to the
chaise, because it is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) same my poor father and mother
drove, but if you don't like it I will sell it, and you shall
have a pony-carriage of your own. I cannot say how
far above every other idea and object on earth you seem
to me -- nobody knows -- God only knows -- how much
you are to me!''
Bathsheba's heart was young, and it swelled with
sympathy for the deep-natured man who spoke so
simply.
``Don't say it! don't! I cannot bear you to feel so
much, and me to feel nothing. And I am afraid they
will notice us, Mr. Boldwood. Will you let the matter
rest now? I cannot think collectedly. I did not know
you were going to say this to me. O, I am wicked to
have made you suffer so!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was frightened as well
as agitated at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vehemence.
``Say then, that you don't absolutely refuse. Do not
quite refuse?''
``I can do nothing. I cannot answer.<div class="bookquote">``I may speak to you again on the
subject?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I may think of you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose you may think of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And hope to obtain you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- do not hope! Let us go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will call upon you again to-morrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- please not. Give me time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- I will give you any time.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said earnestly and
gratefully. <div class="bookquote">``I am happier now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- I beg you! Don't be happier if happiness
only comes from my agreeing. Be neutral, Mr. Bold-
wood! I must think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will wait.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned away. Boldwood dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
gaze to the ground, and stood long like a man who did not
know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was. Realities then returned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
which eclipses it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), too, then went on.




<p/>CHAPTER XX



<p/>PERPLEXITY -- GRINDING THE SHEARS -- A QUARREL


<p/><div class="bookquote">``HE (<font color='blue'><b>Bold</b></font>) is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I
can desire.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba mused.
Yet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or
the reverse to kind, did not exercise kindness, here.
The rarest offerings of the purest loves are but a self-
indulgence, and no generosity at all.
Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), was
eventually able to look calmly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) offer. It was one
which many women of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own station in the neighbour-
hood, and not a few of higher rank, would have been
wild to accept and proud to publish. In every point of
view, ranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), a lonely girl, should marry, and marry this
earnest, well-to-do, and respected man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was close
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) doors: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) standing was sufficient: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) qualities
were even supererogatory. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) felt, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) did
not, any wish whatever for the married state in the
abstract, she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could not reasonably have rejected him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
being a woman who frequently appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) under,
standing for deliverance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) whims. Boldwood as
a means to marriage was unexceptionable: she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) esteemed
and liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). It appears
that ordinary men take wives because possession is not
possible without marriage, and that ordinary women
accept husbands because marriage is not possible with,
out possession; with totally differing aims the method is
the same on both sides. But the understood incentive
on the woman's part was wanting here. Besides, Bath-
sheba's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house
was a novel one, and the novelty had not yet begun to
wear off.
But a disquiet filled her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) which was somewhat to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
credit, for it would have affected few. Beyond the men-
tioned reasons with which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) combated her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) objections,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had a strong feeling that, having been the one who
began the game, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ought in honesty to accept the conse-
quences. Still the reluctance remained. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said in the
same breath that it would be ungenerous not to marry
Boldwood, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) couldn't do it to save her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) life.
Bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera-
tive aspect. An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart
in spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) often performed actions of the greatest
temerity with a manner of extreme discretion. Many of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were perfect syllogisms; unluckily they
always remained thoughts. Only a few were irrational
assumptions; but, unfortunately, they were the ones
which most frequently grew into deeds.
The next day to that of the declaration she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found
Gabriel Oak at the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) garden, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
shears for the sheep-shearing. All the surrounding
cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation;
the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign.
Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara-
tion -- sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning-hooks, ranking
with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common
necessity for point and edge.
Cainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel's grindstone,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head performing a melancholy see-saw up and down
with each turn of the wheel. Oak stood somewhat as
Eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
arrows: his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) figure slightly bent, the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) body
thrown over on the shears, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head balanced side-
ways, with a critical compression of the lips and contrac-
tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mistress came up and looked upon them in
silence for a minute or two; then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said --
``Cain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare.
I'll turn the winch of the grindstone. I want to speak
to you, Gabriel.
Cain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle.
Gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise, quelled its
expression, and looked down again. Bathsheba turned
the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.
The peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel
has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind. It
is a sort of attenuated variety of Ixion's punishment,
and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of
heavy, and the body's centre of gravity seems to
settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere be-
tween the eyebrows and the crown. Bathsheba felt
the unpleasant symptoms after two or three dozen
turns.
``Will you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?''
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said. ``My head is in a`whirl, and I can't talk.
Gabriel turned. Bathsheba then began, with some
awkwardness, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) thoughts to stray occasion-
ally from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) story to attend to the shears, which
required a little nicety in sharpening.
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you if the men made any observa-
tions on my going behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood
yesterday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they did.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``You don't hold
the shears right, miss -- I knew you wouldn't know the
way -- hold like this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) relinquished the winch, and inclosing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) two
hands completely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own -LRB-taking each as we some-
times slap a child's hand in teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to write-RRB-,
grasped the shears with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Incline the edge so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said.
Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words,
and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in-
structor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) spoke.
<div class="bookquote">``That will do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Bathsheba. <div class="bookquote">``Loose my
hands. I won't have them held! Turn the winch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel freed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hands quietly, retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
handle, and the grinding went on.
<div class="bookquote">``Did the men think it odd?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said again.
<div class="bookquote">``Odd was not the idea, miss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did they say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That Farmer Boldwood's name and your own
were likely to be flung over pulpit together before the
year was out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought so by the look of them! Why, there's
nothing in it. A more foolish remark was never made,
and I want you to contradict it! that's what I came for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) moments of incredulity, relieved.
<div class="bookquote">``They must have heard our conversation.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
continued.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, Bathsheba!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, stopping the
handle, and gazing into her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face with astonishment.
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Everdene, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, with dignity.
<div class="bookquote">``I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of
marriage, I bain't going to tell a story and say he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
didn't to please you. I have already tried to please
you too much for my own good!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) with round-eyed perplexity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did not know whether to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) for disappointed
love of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), or to be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) for having got
over it -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tone being ambiguous.
<div class="bookquote">``I said I wanted you just to mention that it was
not true I was going to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mur-
mured, with a slight decline in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) assurance.
<div class="bookquote">``I can say that to them if you wish, Miss Everdene.
And I could likewise give an opinion to `ee on what
you have done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I daresay. But I don't want your opinion.``I suppose not.'' said Gabriel
bitterly, and going on
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) words rising and falling in a
regular swell and cadence as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stooped or rose with
the winch, which directed them, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
position, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally
along the garden, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes being fixed on a leaf upon
the ground.
With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act;
but, as does not always happen, time gained was
prudence insured. It must be added, however, that
time was very seldom gained. At this period the
single opinion in the parish on herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) doings
that she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) valued as sounder than her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) own was Gabriel
Oak's. And the outspoken honesty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) character
was such- that on any subject even that of her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) love
for, or marriage with, another man, the same disinter-
estedness of opinion might be calculated on, and be
had for the asking. Thoroughly convinced of the
impossibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own suit, a high resolve constrained
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not to injure that of another. This is a lover's
most stoical virtue, as the lack of it is a lover's most
venial sin. Knowing he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would reply truly, she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) asked
the question, painful as she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) must have known the sub-
ject would be. Such is the selfishness of some charm-
ing women. Perhaps it was some excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) thus
torturing honesty to her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) own advantage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had
absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach.
``Well, what is your opinion of my conduct.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
said, quietly.
``That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek,
and comely woman.''
In an instant Bathsheba's face coloured with the
angry crimson of a danby sunset. But she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) forbore
to utter this feeling, and the reticence of her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) tongue
only made the loquacity of her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) face the more notice-
able.
The next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.
``Perhaps you don't like the rudeness of my repri-
manding you, for I know it is rudeness; but I thought
it would do good.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) instantly replied sarcastically --
``On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that
I see in your abuse the praise of discerning people!''
``I am glad you don't mind it, for I said it honestly
and with every serious meaning.''
``I see. But, unfortunately, when you try not to
speak in jest you are amusing -- just as when you wish
to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a sensible word
It was a hard hit, but Bathsheba had unmistakably
lost her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) temper, and on that account Gabriel had
never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said nothing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) then broke out --
``I may ask, I suppose, where in particular my
unworthiness lies? In my not marrying you, perhaps!
``Not by any means.'' said Gabriel quietly. ``I have
long given up thinking of that matter.<div class="bookquote">``Or wishing it, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
said; and it was
apparent that she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) expected an unhesitating denial of
this supposition.
Whatever Gabriel felt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) coolly echoed her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) words --
<div class="bookquote">``Or wishing it either.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A woman may be treated with a bitterness which
is sweet to her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>), and with a rudeness which is not
offensive. Bathsheba would have submitted to an
indignant chastisement for her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) levity had Gabriel pro-
tested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was loving her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) at the same time; the
impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable, even if
it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the
humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife. This was
what she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had been expecting, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) had not
got. To be lectured because the lecturer saw her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) in
the cold morning light of open-shuttered disillusion
was exasperating. He (<font color='blue'><b>lecturer</b></font>) had not finished, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>lecturer</b></font>)
continued in a more agitated voice: --
<div class="bookquote">``My opinion is -LRB-since you ask it-RRB- that you are
greatly to blame for playing pranks upon a man like
Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime. Leading on a
man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action.
And even, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), you might have let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) find it out in
some way of true loving-kindness, and not by sending
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a valentine's letter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba laid down the shears.
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot allow any man to -- to criticise my private
Conduct!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Nor will I for a minute.
So you'll please leave the farm at the end of the week!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>It may have been a peculiarity -- at any rate it was
a fact -- that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion
of an earthly sort her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) lower lip trembled: when by a
refined emotion, her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) upper or heavenward one. Her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
nether lip quivered now.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well, so I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel calmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
been held to her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) by a beautiful thread which it pained
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to spoil by breaking, rather than by a chain he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
could not break. <div class="bookquote">``I should be even better pleased to
go at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) added.
<div class="bookquote">``Go at once then, in Heaven's name!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>),her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>)
eyes flashing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), though never meeting them.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't let me see your face any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Miss Everdene -- so it shall be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shears and went away from her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) in
placid dignity, as Moses left the presence of Pharaoh.




<p/>CHAPTER XXI



<p/>TROUBLES IN THE FOLD -- A MESSAGE


<p/>GABRIEL OAK had ceased to feed the Weatherbury
flock for about four-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday
afternoon the elderly gentlemen Joseph Poorgrass,
Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came
running up to the house of the mistress of the Upper
Farm.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever is the matter, men?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, meeting
them at the door just as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was coming out on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close
compression of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) two red lips, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had
accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.
<div class="bookquote">``Sixty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph Poorgrass.
<div class="bookquote">``Seventy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Moon.
<div class="bookquote">``Fifty-nine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>said Susan Tall's husband.
<div class="bookquote">''-- Sheep have broke fence.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tall husband</b></font>)</div>said Fray.
<div class="bookquote">''-- And got into a field of young clover.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall.
<div class="bookquote">''-- Young clover!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Moon.
<div class="bookquote">''-- Clover!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Joseph Poorgrass.
<div class="bookquote">``And they be getting blasted.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Henery Fray.
<div class="bookquote">``That they be.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph.
``And will all die as dead as nits, if they bain't got
out and cured!``said Tall.
Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and
puckers by his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) concern. Fray's forehead was wrinkled
both perpendicularly and crosswise, after the pattern of
a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban
Tall's lips were thin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) face were rigid. Matthew's
jaws sank, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) eyes turned whichever way the
strongest muscle happened to pull them.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, <div class="bookquote">``and I was sitting at home,
looking for Ephesians, and says I to myself, '' (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>`Tis
nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians in this
danged Testament.'' when who should come in but
Henery there: ``Joseph,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) said, ``the sheep have
With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was
blasted theirselves -- ''
With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was
speech and speech exclamation. Moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) had
hardly recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) equanimity since the disturbance
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) had suffered from Oak's remarks.
``That's enought -- that's enough! -- oh, you fools!''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) cried, throwing the parasol and Prayer-book into
the passage, and running out of doors in the direction
signified. ``To come to me, and not go and get them
out directly! Oh, the stupid numskulls!''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) eyes were at their darkest and brightest now.
Bathsheba's beauty belonged rather to the demonian
than to the angelic school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) never looked so well as
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) was angry -- and particularly when the effect
was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress, care-
fully put on before a glass.
All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) to the clover-field, Joseph sinking down in the
midst when about half-way, like an individual withering
in a world which was more and more insupportable.
Having once received the stimulus that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) presence
always gave them they went round among the sheep
with a will. The majority of the afflicted animals were
lying down, and could not be stirred. These were
bodily lifted out, and the others driven into the adjoining
field. Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several
more fell down, and lay helpless and livid as the rest.
Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these
primest specimens of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) prime flock as they rolled
there --
Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.
Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing
being quick and short, whilst the bodies of all were
fearfully distended.
``O, what can I do, what can I do!'' said Bathsheba,
helplessly. ``Sheep are such unfortunate animals! --
there's always something happening to them! I never
knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape
or other.''
``There's only one way of saving them.'' said Tall.
``What way? Tell me quick!''
``They must be pierced in the side with a thing made
on purpose.''
``Can you do it? Can I?''
``No, ma'am. We can't, nor you neither. It must
be done in a particular spot. If ye go to the right or
left but an inch you stab the ewe and kill her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). Not
even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.''
``Then they must die.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) said, in a resigned tone.
``Only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,''
said Joseph, now just come up. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could cure 'em
all if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were here.''
``Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Let's get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''
``Shepherd Oak,'' said Matthew. ``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>)'s a clever
man in talents!''
``Ah, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) is so!'' said Joseph Poorgrass.
``True -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>)'s the man.'' said Laban Tall.
``How dare you name that man in my presence!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
said excitedly. ``I told you never to allude to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), nor
shall you if you stay with me. Ah!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) added, brighten-
ing, ``Farmer Boldwood knows!''
``O no, ma'am'' said Matthew. ``Two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) store
ewes got into some vetches t`other day, and were just
like these. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sent a man on horseback here post-haste
for Gable, and Gable went and saved 'em, Farmer
Boldwood hev got the thing they do it with. <div class="bookquote">``Tis a

Joseph?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay -- a holler pipe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>echoed Joseph. <div class="bookquote">``That's what
`tis.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, sure -- that's the machine.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>chimed in Henery
Fray, reflectively, with an Oriental indifference to the
flight of time.
<div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>burst out Bathsheba, ``don't stand there with
your ``ayes'' and your ``sures<div class="bookquote">'' talking at me! Get
somebody to cure the sheep instantly!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>All then stalked or in consternation, to get some-
body as directed, without any idea of who it was to be.
In a minute they had vanished through the gate, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) stood alone with the dying flock.
<div class="bookquote">``Never will I send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) never!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) said firmly.
One of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly,
extended itself, and jumped high into the air. The
leap was an astonishing one. The ewe fell heavily, and
lay still.
Bathsheba went up to it. The sheep was dead.
<div class="bookquote">``O, what shall I do -- what shall I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) again
exclaimed, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I won't send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>).
No, I won't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The most vigorous expression of a resolution does
not always coincide with the greatest vigour of the
resolution itself. It is often flung out as a sort of prop
to support a decaying conviction which, whilst strong,
required no enunciation to prove it so. The <div class="bookquote">``No, I
won't''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>of Bathsheba meant virtually, <div class="bookquote">``I think I must.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) assistants through the gate, and
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) hand to one of them. Laban answered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
signal.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is Oak staying?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Across the valley at Nest Cottage!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
must return instantly -- that I say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes
was on Poll, the bay, bare-backed, and with only a
halter by way of rein. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistants</b></font>) diminished down the
hill.
Bathsheba watched. So did all the rest. Tall
cantered along the bridle-path through Sixteen Acres,
Sheeplands, Middle Field The Flats, Cappel's Piece,
shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge, and
ascended from the valley through Springmead and
Whitepits on the other side. The cottage to which
Gabriel had retired before taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) final departure
from the locality was visible as a white spot on the
opposite hill, backed by blue firs. Bathsheba walked
up and down. The men entered the field and
endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb creatures
by rubbing them. Nothing availed.
Bathsheba continued walking. The horse was seen
descending the hill, and the wearisome series had to be
repeated in reverse order: Whitepits, Springmead,
Cappel's Piece, The Flats, Middle Field, Sheeplands,
Sixteen Acres. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hoped Tall had had presence of
mind enough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return
himself on foot. The rider neared them. It was Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``O, what folly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
Gabriel was not visible anywhere.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) is already gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said.
Tall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face
tragic as Morton's after the battle of Shrewsbury.
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) verbal lettre-de-cachet could possibly have miscarried.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) says beggars mustn't be choosers.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laban</b></font>)</div>replied Laban.
<div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the young farmer, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes
and drawing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) breath for an outburst. Joseph
Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) shall not come unless you request en
to come civilly and in a proper manner, as becomes any
``woman begging a favour.''
``Oh, oh, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) answer! Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) get his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
airs? Who am I, then, to be treated like that? Shall
I beg to a man who has begged to me?''
Another of the flock sprang into the air, and fell
dead.
The men looked grave, as if they suppressed opinion.
Bathsheba turned aside, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes full of tears. The
strait she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was in through pride and shrewishness could
not be disguised longer: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) burst out crying bitterly;
they all saw it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) attempted no further concealment.
``I wouldn't cry about it, miss.'' said William Small-
bury, compassionately. ``Why not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) softer like?
I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d come then. Gable is a true man in that
way.''
Bathsheba checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) grief and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes.
``O, it is a wicked cruelty to me -- it is -- it is!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
murmured. ``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gable</b></font>) drives me to do what I wouldn't;
yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gable</b></font>) does! -- Tall, come indoors.''
After this collapse, not very dignified for the head
of an establishment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went into the house, Tall at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heels. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sat down and hastily scribbled a
note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence
which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell follows a
storm. The note was none the less polite for being
written in a hurry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) held it at a distance, was
about to fold it, then added these words at the
bottom: --
``Do not desert me, Gabriel!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lips, as if thereby to suspend till too late the action
of conscience in examining whether such strategy were
justifiable. The note was despatched as the message
had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.
It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened
between the messenger's departure and the sound of the
horse's tramp again outside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)- could not watch this
time, but, leaning over the old bureau at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
written the letter, closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes, as if to keep out both
hope and fear.
The case, however, was a promising one. Gabriel
was not angry: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was simply neutral, although her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) first
command had been so haughty. Such imperiousness
would have damned a little less beauty; and on the
other hand, such beauty would have redeemed a little
less imperiousness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went out when the horse was heard, and looked
up. A mounted figure passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and the
sky, and drew on towards the field of sheep, the rider
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) face in receding. Gabriel looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell
distinctly opposite tales. Bathsheba looked full of
gratitude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said: --
``O, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!''
Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) previous
delay was the one speech in the language that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could
pardon for not being commendation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) readiness
now.
Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened
on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) knew from the look which sentence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
note had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). Bathsheba followed to the
field.
Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had flung off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) coat, rolled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shirt-sleeves,
and taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pocket the instrument of salvation.
It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance passing
down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a
dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon.
Passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand over the sheep's left flank, and
selecting the proper point, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) punctured the skin and
rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
suddenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its
place. A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible
enough to have extinguished a candle held at the
orifice.
It has been said that mere ease after torment is de-
light for a time; and the countenances of these poor
creatures expressed it now. Forty-nine operations were
successfully performed. Owing to the great hurry
necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock,
Gabriel missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) aim in one case, and in one only --
striking wide of the mark, and inflicting a mortal blow
at once upon the suffering ewe. Four had died; three
recovered without an operation. The total number of
sheep which had thus strayed and injured themselves
so dangerously was fifty-seven.
When the love-led man had ceased from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labours,
Bathsheba came and looked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the face.
``Gabriel, will you stay on with me?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), said,
smiling winningly, and not troubling to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips
quite together again at the end, because there was going
to be another smile soon.
<div class="bookquote">``I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) again.




<p/>CHAPTER XXII



<p/>THE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP-SHEARERS


<p/>MEN thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as
often by not making the most of good spirits when they
have them as by lacking good spirits when they are
indispensable. Gabriel lately, for the first time since
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) prostration by misfortune, had been independent in
thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent --
conditions which, powerless without an opportunity as
an opportunity without them is barren, would have
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a sure lift upwards when the favourable-con-
junction should have occurred. But this incurable
loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) time
ruinously. The spring tides were going by without
floating him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) off, and the neap might soon come which
could not.
It was the first day of June, and the sheep-shearing
season culminated, the landscape, even to the leanest
pasture, being all health and colour. Every green was
young, every pore was open, and every stalk was swollen
with racing currents of juice. God was palpably present
in the country, and the devil had gone with the world
to town. Flossy catkins of the later kinds, fern-sprouts
like bishops' croziers, the square-headed moschatel, the
odd cuckoo-pint, -- like an apoplectic saint in a niche
of malachite, -- snow-white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort,
approximating to human flesh, the enchanter's night-
shade, and the black-petaled doleful-bells, were among
the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,
the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the
master-shearer; the second and third shearers, who
travelled in the exercise of their calling, and do not re-
quire definition by name; Henery Fray the fourth
shearer, Susan Tall's husband the fifth, Joseph Poorgrass
the sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant-shearer, and
Gabriel Oak as general supervisor. None of these were
clothed to any extent worth mentioning, each appearing
to have hit in the matter of raiment the decent mean
between a high and low caste Hindoo. An angularity
of lineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general,
proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day.
They sheared in the great barn, called for the nonce
the Shearing-barn, which on ground-plan resembled a
church with transepts. It not only emulated the form
of the neighbouring church of the parish, but vied with
it in antiquity. Whether the barn had ever formed one
of a group of conventual buildings nobody seemed to be
aware; no trace of such surroundings remained. The
vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to admit a waggon
laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were spanned
by heavy-pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut,
whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not
apparent in erections where more ornament has been
attempted. The dusky, filmed, chestnut roof, braced
and tied in by huge collars, curves, and diagonals, was
far nobler in design, because more wealthy in material,
than nine-tenths of those in our modern churches.
Along each side wall was a range of striding buttresses,
throwing deep shadows on the spaces between them,
which were perforated by lancet openings, combining
in their proportions the precise requirements both of
beauty and ventilation.
One could say about this barn, what could hardly
be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in
age and style, that the purpose which had dictated its
original erection was the same with that to which it
was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of
those two typical remnants of mediaevalism, the old
barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutila-
tion at the hands of time. Here at least the spirit of
the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the
modern beholder. Standing before this abraded pile,
the eye regarded its present usage, the mind-dwelt upon
its past history, with a satisfied sense of functional
continuity throughout -- a feeling almost of gratitude,
and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea
which had heaped it up. The fact that four centuries
had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake,
inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to
any reaction that had battered it down, invested this
simple grey effort of old minds with a repose, if not a
grandeur, which a too curious reflection was apt to
disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers. For
once medievalism and modernism had a common stand-
point. The lanccolate windows, the time-eaten arch-
stones and chamfers, the orientation of the axis, the
misty chestnut work of the rafters, referred to no exploded
fortifying art or worn-out religious creed. The defence
and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a study,
a religion, and a desire.
To-day the large side doors were thrown open
towards the sun to admit a bountiful light to the
immediate spot of the shearers' operations, which was
the wood threshing-floor in the centre, formed of thick
oak, black with age and polished by the beating of flails
for many generations, till it had grown as slippery and
as rich in hue as the state-room floors of an Elizabethan
mansion. Here the shearers knelt, the sun slanting in
upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms, and the polished
shears they flourished, causing these to bristle with a
thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man.
Beneath them a captive sheep lay panting, quickening
its pants as misgiving merged in terror, till it quivered
like the hot landscape outside.
This picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred
years ago did not produce that marked contrast between
ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast
of date. In comparison with cities, Weatherbury was
immutable. The citizen's Then is the rustic's Now.
In London, twenty or thirty-years ago are old times;
in Paris ten years, or five; in Weatherbury three or
four score years were included in the mere present,
and nothing less than a century set a mark on its
face or tone. Five decades hardly modified the cut of
a gaiter, the embroidery of a smock-frock, by the breadth
of a hair. Ten generations failed to alter the turn of
a single phrase. In these Wessex nooks the busy out-
sider's ancient times are only old; his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) old times are still
new; his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) present is futurity.
So the barn was natural to the shearers, and the
shearers were in harmony with the barn.
The spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesi-
astically to nave and chancel extremities, were fenced
off with hurdles, the sheep being all collected in a crowd
within these two enclosures; and in one angle a catching-
pen was formed, in which three or four sheep were
continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without
loss of time. In the background, mellowed by tawny
shade, were the three women, Maryann Money, and
Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering up the
fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for
tying them round. They were indifferently well assisted
by the old maltster, who, when the malting season from
October to April had passed, made himself useful upon
any of the bordering farmsteads.
``Behind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the
men to see that there was no cutting or wounding
through carelessness, and that the animals were shorn
close. Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously,
half his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) time being spent in attending to the others
and selecting the sheep for them. At the present
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was engaged in handing round a mug of
mild liquor, supplied from a barrel in the corner,
and cut pieces of bread and cheese.
Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution
there, and lecturing one of the younger operators who
had allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) last finished sheep to go off among
the flock without re-stamping it with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) initials, came
again to Gabriel, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) put down the luncheon to drag
a frightened ewe to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shear-station, flinging it over
upon its back with a dexterous twist of the arm
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lopped off the tresses about its head, and opened
up the neck and collar, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mistress quietly looking
on:
``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) blushes at the insult.'' murmured Bathsheba,
watching the pink flush which arose and overspread
the neck and shoulders of the ewe where they were
left bare by the clicking shears -- a flush which was
enviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries,
and would have been creditable, for its promptness, to
any woman in the world.
Poor Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content
by having her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes critically regarding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) skilful shears, which apparently were going to gather
up a piece of the flesh at every close, and yet never did
so. Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was
not over happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had no wish to converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>):
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) bright lady and himself formed one group,
exclusively their own, and containing no others in the
world, was enough.
So the chatter was all on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side. There is a
loquacity that tells nothing, which was Bathsheba's;
and there is a silence which says much: that was
Gabriel's. Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
went on to fling the ewe over upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other side,
covering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) knee, gradually running
the shears line after line round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dewlap; thence
about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flank and back, and finishing over the tail.
``Well done, and done quickly!'' said Bathsheba,
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watch as the last snip resounded.
``How long, miss?'' said Gabriel, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brow.
``Three-and-twenty minutes and a half since you took
the first lock from its forehead. It is the first time that
I have ever seen one done in less than half an hour.''
The clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece -- how
perfectly like Aphrodite rising from the foam should
have been seen to be realized -- looking startled and
shy at the loss of its garment, which lay on the floor
in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion visible
being the inner surface only, which, never before exposed,
was white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the
minutest kind.
``Cain Ball!''
``Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!''
Cainy now runs forward with the tar-pot. ``B. E.'' is
newly stamped upon the shorn skin, and away the simple
dam leaps, panting, over the board into the shirtless
flock outside. Then up comes Maryann; throws the
loose locks into the middle of the fleece, rolls it up,
and carries it into the background as three-and-a-half
pounds of unadulterated warmth for the winter enjoy-
ment of persons unknown and far away, who will,
however, never experience the superlative comfort
derivable from the wool as it here exists, new and pure
-- before the unctuousness of its nature whilst in a
living state has dried, stiffened, and been washed out
-- rendering it just now as superior to anything woollen
as cream is superior to milk-and-water.
But heartless circumstance could not leave entire
Gabriel's happiness of this morning. The rams, old
ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly undergone their
stripping, and the men were proceeding with the shear-
lings and hogs, when Oak's belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was going to
stand pleasantly by and time him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) through another
performance was painfully interrupted by Farmer Bold-
wood's appearance in the extremest corner of the barn.
Nobody seemed to have perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) entry, but there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farmer</b></font>) certainly was. Boldwood always carried with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) a
social atmosphere of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own, which everybody felt who
came near him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); and the talk, which Bathsheba's
presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally
suspended.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to
greet him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) with a carriage of perfect ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) spoke to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) in low tones, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) instinctively modulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
own to the same pitch, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) voice ultimately even
caught the inflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was far from having
a wish to appear mysteriously connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); but
woman at the impressionable age gravitates to the larger
body not only in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) choice of words, which is apparent
every day, but even in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shades of tone and humour,
when the influence is great.
What they conversed about was not audible to
Gabriel, who was too independent to get near, though
too concerned to disregard. The issue of their dialogue
was the taking of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand by the courteous farmer to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over the spreading-board into the bright June
sunlight outside. Standing beside the sheep already
shorn, they went on talking again. Concerning the
flock? Apparently not. Gabriel theorized, not without
truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach
of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon it.
Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying
upon the ground, in a way which suggested less ovine
criticism than womanly embarrassment. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became
more or less red in the cheek, the blood wavering in
uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space between
ebb and flood. Gabriel sheared on, constrained and
sad.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left Boldwood's side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) walked up and
down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
reappeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new riding-habit of myrtle-green, which
fitted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the waist as a rind fits its fruit; and young
Bob Coggan led -on -her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mare, Boldwood fetching his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
own horse from the tree under which it had been tied.
Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and in en-
deavouring to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) shearing at the same time
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) watched Boldwood's manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) snipped the
sheep in the groin. The animal plunged; Bathsheba
instantly gazed towards it, and saw the blood.
``O, Gabriel!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, with severe remon-
strance you who are so strict with the other men -- see
what you are doing yourself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>To an outsider there was not much to complain of
in this remark; but to Oak, who ``knew Bathsheba to be
well aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) herself was the cause of the poor
ewe's wound, because she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had wounded the ewe's shearer
in a -- still more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>shearer</b></font>) inferiority to both herself and Boldwood was
not calculated to heal. But a manly resolve to recognize
boldly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had no longer a lover's interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>),
helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) occasionally to conceal a feeling.
``Bottle!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.
Cainy Ball ran up, the wound was anointed, and the
shearing continued.
Boldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle,
and before they turned away she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again spoke out to Oak
with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness.
``I am going now to see Mr. Boldwood's Leicesters.
Take my place in the barn, Gabriel, and keep the men
carefully to their work.''
The horses' heads were put about, and they trotted
away.
Boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great
interest among all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); but, after having been
pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar
of thriving bachelorship, his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lapse was an anticlimax
somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by
consumption in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) proofs that it was not
a fatal disease.
``That means matrimony.'' said Temperance Miller,
following them out of sight with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
``I reckon that's the size o`t.'' said Coggan, working
along without looking up.
``Well, better wed over the mixen than over the moor,''
said Laban Tall, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) sheep.
Henery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the
same time: ``I don't see why a maid should take a
husband when she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)'s bold enough to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) own
battles, and don't want a home; for `tis keeping another
woman out. But let it be, for `tis a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
should trouble two houses.''
As usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invari-
ably provoked the criticism of individuals like Henery
Fray. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) emblazoned fault was to be too pronounced
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) objections, and not sufficiently overt in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
likings. We learn that it is not the rays which bodies
absorb, but those which they reject, that give them the
colours they are known by; and win the same way people
are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms, whilst
their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at all.
Henery continued in a more complaisant mood: ``I
once hinted my mind to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on a few things, as nearly
as a battered frame dared to do so to such a froward
piece. You all know, neighbours, what a man I be,
and how I come down with my powerful words when
my pride is boiling wi' scarn?''
``We do, we do, Henery.''
``So I said, '' Mistress Everdene, there's places empty,
and there's gifted men willing; but the spite -- no. not
the spite -- I didn't say spite -- ``but the villainy of the
contrarikind.<div class="bookquote">'' I said -LRB-meaning womankind-RRB-, ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>keeps 'em
out.<div class="bookquote">'' That wasn't too strong for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>), say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Passably well put.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and I would have said it, had death and
salvation overtook me for it. Such is my spirit when I
have a mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A true man, and proud as a lucifer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see the artfulness? Why, 'twas about being
baily really; but I didn't put it so plain that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could
understand my meaning, so I could lay it on all the
stronger. That was my depth! ... However, let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
marry an she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will. Perhaps `tis high time. I believe
Farmer Boldwood kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) behind the spear-bed at the
sheep-washing t`other day -- that I do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah, neighbour Oak -- how`st know?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said, Henery,
mildly.
<div class="bookquote">``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) told me all that passed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, with
a pharisaical sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was not as other shearers in
this matter.
<div class="bookquote">``Ye have a right to believe it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Henery</b></font>)</div>said Henery, with
dudgeon; <div class="bookquote">``a very true right. But I mid see a little
distance into things! To be long-headed enough for a
baily's place is a poor mere trifle -- yet a trifle more than
nothing. However, I look round upon life quite cool.
Do you heed me, neighbours? My words, though made
as simple as I can, mid be rather deep for some heads.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes, Henery, we quite heed ye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A strange old piece, goodmen -- whirled about from
here to yonder, as if I were nothing! A little warped,
too. But I have my depths; ha, and even my great
depths! I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to
brain. But no -- O no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A strange old piece, ye say!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposed the maltster,
in a querulous voice. ``At the same time ye be no old
man worth naming -- no old man at all. Yer teeth
bain't half gone yet; and what's a old man's standing
if se be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth bain't gone? Weren't I stale in
wedlock afore ye were out of arms? ``Tis a poor thing
to be sixty, when there's people far past four-score -- a
boast`weak as water.''
It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to
sink minor differences when the maltster had to be
pacified.
``Weak as-water! yes.'' said Jan Coggan.- ``Malter,
we feel ye to be a wonderful veteran man, and nobody
can gainsay it.''
``Nobody.'' said Joseph Poorgrass. ``Ye be a very
rare old spectacle, malter, and we all admire ye for that
gift. ''
``Ay, and as a young man, when my senses were in
prosperity, I was likewise liked by a good-few who
knowed me.<div class="bookquote">'' said the maltster.
'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>`Ithout doubt you was -- `ithout doubt.''
The bent and hoary `man was satisfied, and so
apparently was Henery Frag. That matters should
continue pleasant Maryann spoke, who, what with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty
linsey, had at present the mellow hue of an old sketch
in oils -- notably some of Nicholas Poussin's: --
``Do anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or
any second-hand fellow at all that would do for poor
me?'' said Maryann. ``A perfect one I don't expect to
at my time of life. If I could hear of such a thing
twould do me more good than toast and ale.''
Coggan furnished a suitable reply. Oak went on
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) shearing, and said not another word. Pestilent
moods had come, and teased away his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) quiet. Bathsheba
had shown indications of anointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) above his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
fellows by installing him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) as the bailiff that the farm
imperatively required. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) did not covet the post
relatively to the farm: in relation to herself, as beloved
by him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) and unmarried to another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) had coveted it.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) readings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) seemed now to be vapoury and
indistinct. His (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) lecture to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) thought, one of
the absurdest mistakes. Far from coquetting with
Boldwood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) had trifled with himself in thus feigning
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) had trifled with another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was inwardly
convinced that, in accordance with the anticipations of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) easy-going and worse-educated comrades, that day
would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss
Everdene. Gabriel at this time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life had out-
grown the instinctive dislike which every Christian
boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now quite
frequently, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) inwardly said, ``I find more bitter
than death the woman whose heart is snares and
nets!'' This was mere exclamation -- the froth of the
storm. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) adored Bathsheba just the same.
``We workfolk shall have some lordly- junketing
to-night.'' said Cainy Ball, casting forth his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts in
a new direction. ``This morning I see'em making the
great puddens in the milking-pails -- lumps of fat as big
as yer thumb, Mister Oak! I've never seed such
splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my
life -- they never used to be bigger then a horse-bean.
And there was a great black crock upon the brandish
with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) legs a-sticking out, but I don't know what was
in within.''
``And there's two bushels of biffins for apple-pies,''
said Maryann.
``Well, I hope to do my duty by it all.'' said Joseph
Poorgrass, in a pleasant, masticating manner of anticipa-
tion. ``Yes; victuals and drink is a cheerful thing,
and gives nerves to the nerveless, if the form of words
may be used. <div class="bookquote">``Tis the gospel of the body, without
which we perish, so to speak it.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIII



<p/>EVENTIDE -- A SECOND DECLARATION


<p/>FOR the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the
grass-plot beside the house, the end of the table being
thrust over the sill of the wide parlour window and a
foot or two into the room. Miss Everdene sat inside
the window, facing down the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) was thus at
the head without mingling with the men.
This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
red cheeks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
skeins of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) shadowy hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) seemed to expect
assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table was
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) request left vacant until after they had begun
and the duties appertaining to that end, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) did
with great readiness.
At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate,
and crossed the green to Bathsheba at the window.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) apologized for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lateness: his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) arrival was evidently
by arrangement.
<div class="bookquote">``Gabriel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">'' will you move again, please,
and let Mr. Boldwood come there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oak moved in silence back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) original seat.
The gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style,
in a new coat and white waistcoat, quite contrasting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) usual sober suits of grey. Inwardy, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional
degree. So also was Bathsheba now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had come,
though the uninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff
who had been dismissed for theft, disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) equan-
imity for a while.
Supper being ended, Coggan began on his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) own
private account, without reference to listeners: --
l've lost my love and l care not,
I've lost my love, and l care not;
I shall soon have another
That's better than t`other!
I've lost my love, and I care not.
This lyric, when concluded, was received with a
silently appreciative gaze at the table, implying that the
performance, like a work by those established authors
who are independent of notices in the papers, was a
well-known delight which required no applause.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Master Poorgrass, your song!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``I be all but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, diminishing himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Nonsense; wou`st never be so ungrateful, Joseph --
never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, expressing hurt feelings by an
inflection of voice. ``And mistress is looking hard at
ye, as much as to say, ``Sing at once, Joseph Poor-
grass.''
``Faith, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) is; well, I must suffer it! ... Just
eye my features, and see if the tell-tale blood overheats
me much, neighbours?''
``No, yer blushes be quite reasonable.'' said Coggan.
``I always tries to keep my colours from rising when
a beauty's eyes get fixed on me.'' said Joseph, differently;
``but if so be `tis willed they do, they must.''
``Now, Joseph, your song, please.'' said Bathsheba,
from the window.
``Well, really, ma'am.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) replied, in a yielding tone,
``I don't know what to say. It would be a poor plain
ballet of my own composure.<div class="bookquote">''
Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the supper-party.
Poorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth a flickering yet
commendable piece of sentiment, the tune of which
consisted of the key-note and another, the latter being
the sound chiefly dwelt upon. This was so successful
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) rashly plunged into a second in the same
breath, after a few false starts: --
I sow'-ed th'-e
I sow'-ed
I sow'-ed the'-e seeds' of love',
I-it was' all' i'-in the'-e spring',
I-in A'-pril', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sun'-ny' June',
When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing.
<div class="bookquote">``Well put out of hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, at the end of the
verse. `They do sing' was a very taking paragraph.''
``Ay; and there was a pretty place at <div class="bookquote">``seeds of
love.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and 'twas well heaved out. Though <div class="bookquote">``love ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>is
a nasty high corner when a man's voice is getting
crazed. Next verse, Master Poorgrass.''
But during this rendering young Bob Coggan ex-
hibited one of those anomalies which will afflict little
people when other persons are particularly serious: in
trying to check his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) laughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) pushed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) throat
as much of the tablecloth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) could get hold of, when,
after continuing hermetically sealed for a short time, his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
mirth burst out through his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) nose. Joseph perceived it,
and with hectic cheeks of indignation instantly ceased
singing. Coggan boxed Bob's ears immediately.
``Go on, Joseph -- go on, and never mind the young
scamp.<div class="bookquote">'' said Coggan. '' (<font color='red'><b>the scamp</b></font>)</div>`Tis a very catching ballet.
Now then again -- the next bar; I'll help ye to flourish
up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy: --
O the wi'-il-lo'-ow tree' will' twist',
And the wil'-low' tre'-ee wi'ill twine'.
But the singer could not be set going again. Bob
Coggan was sent home for his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) ill manners, and tran-
quility was restored by Jacob Smallbury, who volunteered
a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which
the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion
the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) day.
It was still the beaming time of evening, though
night was stealthily making itself visible low down upon
the ground, the western lines of light taking the earth
without alighting upon it to any extent, or illuminating
the dead levels at all. The sun had crept round the
tree as a last effort before death, and then began to
sink, the shearers' lower parts becoming steeped in
embrowning twilight, whilst their heads and shoulders
were still enjoying day, touched with a yellow of self-
sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than
acquired.
The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they
sat, and talked on, and grew as merry as the gods in
Homer's heaven. Bathsheba still remained enthroned
inside the window, and occupied herself in knitting,
from which she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sometimes looked up to view the fading
scene outside. The slow twilight expanded and enveloped
them completely before the signs of moving were shown.
Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
place at the bottom of the table. How long he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
been gone Oak did not know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had apparently
withdrawn into the encircling dusk. Whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was
thinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back
part of the room overlooking the shearers, and their
lively new flames shone down the table and over the
men, and dispersed among the green shadows behind.
Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now
again distinct between their eyes and the light, which
revealed that Boldwood had gone inside the room, and
was sitting near her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>).
Next came the question of the evening. Would Miss
Everdene sing to them the song she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) always sang so
charmingly -- <div class="bookquote">'' The Banks of Allan Water''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-- before they
went home?
After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented,
beckoning to Gabriel, who hastened up into the coveted
atmosphere.
<div class="bookquote">``Have you brought your flute? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Play to my singing, then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) stood up in the window-opening, facing the
men, the candles behind her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), Gabriel on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) right hand,
immediately outside the sash-frame. Boldwood had
drawn up on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) left, within the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) singing
was soft and rather tremulous at first, but it soon swelled
to a steady clearness. Subsequent events caused one
of the verses to be remembered for many months, and
even years, by more than one of those who were gathered
there: --
For his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) bride a soldier sought her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>),
And a winning tongue had he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>):
On the banks of Allan Water
None was gay as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)!
In addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute,
Boldwood supplied a bass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) customary profound
voice, uttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) notes so softly, however, as to abstain
entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of
the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow,
which threw her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) tones into relief. The shearers reclined
against each other as at suppers in the early ages of the
world, and so silent and absorbed were they that her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
breathing could almost be heard between the bars; and
at the end of the ballad, when the last tone loitered on
to an inexpressible close, there arose that buzz of
pleasure which is the attar of applause.
It is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could
not avoid noting the farmer's bearing to-night towards
their entertainer. Yet there was nothing exceptional in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) actions beyond what appertained to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) time of
performing them. It was when the rest were all looking
away that Boldwood observed her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>); when they regarded
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) turned aside; when they thanked or praised he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
was silent; when they were inattentive he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) murmured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thanks. The meaning lay in the difference between
actions, none of which had any meaning of itself;
and the necessity of being jealous, which lovers are
troubled with, did not lead Oak to underestimate these
signs.
Bathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew
from the window, and retired to the back part of the
room, Boldwood thereupon closing the sash and the
shutters, and remaining inside with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). Oak wandered
away under the quiet and scented trees. Recovering
from the softer impressions produced by Bathsheba's
voice, the shearers rose to leave, Coggan turning to
Pennyways as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) pushed back the bench to pass out: --
<div class="bookquote">``I like to give praise where praise is due, and the
man deserves it -- that 'a do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) remarked, looking at
the worthy thief, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) were the masterpiece of some
world-renowned artist.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I should never have believed it if we hadn't
proved it, so to allude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass, ``that
every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as
at the beginning, and not one stole at all.
``I'm sure I don't deserve half the praise you give
me.'' said the virtuous thief, grimly.
``Well, I'll say this for Pennyways.'' added Coggan,
``that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do really make up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to do a
noble thing in the shape of a good action, as I could
see by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). did to-night afore sitting down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s
generally able to carry it out. Yes, I'm proud to say.
neighbours, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s stole nothing at all.
<div class="bookquote">``Well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- `tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it,
Pennyways.<div class="bookquote">'' said Joseph; to which opinion the remainder
of the company subscribed unanimously.
At this time of departure, when nothing more was
visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still
chink of light between the shutters, a passionate scene
was in course of enactment there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
the very seriousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) position; but her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) eye was
bright with the excitement of a triumph -- though it was
a triumph which had rather been contemplated than
desired.
She (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had just risen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was kneeling in it -- inclining
himself over its back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) hand
in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) body moved restlessly, and it was
with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness.
This unwonted abstraction by love of all dignity from
a man of whom it had ever seemed the chief component,
was, in its distressing incongruity, a pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) which
quenched much of the pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) derived from the
proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was idolized.
<div class="bookquote">``I will try to love you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was saying, in a trembling
voice quite unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) usual self-confidence. ``And if I
can believe in any way that I shall make you a good
wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you. But, Mr.
Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable
in any woman, and I don't want to give a solemn
promise to-night. I would rather ask you to wait a few
weeks till I can see my situation better.``But you have every reason to
believe that then -- -- ''
``I have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or
six weeks, between this time and harvest, that
you say you are going to be away from home, I shall be
able to promise to be your wife.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said, firmly. ``But
remember this distinctly, I don't promise yet.''
``It is enough I don't ask more. I can wait on
those dear words. And now, Miss Everdene, good-
night!''
<div class="bookquote">``Good-night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) said, graciously -- almost tenderly;
and Boldwood withdrew with a serene smile.
Bathsheba knew more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had entirely
bared his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heart before her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>), even until he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had almost
worn in her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) eyes the sorry look of a grand bird without
the feathers that make it grand. She (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) had been awe-
struck at her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) past temerity, and was struggling to make
amends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved
the penalty she (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was schooling herself to pay. To have
brought all this about her (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) ears was terrible; but after a
while the situation was not without a fearful joy. The
facility with which even the most timid woman some-
times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is
amalgamated with a little triumph, is marvellous.




<p/>CHAPTER XXIV



<p/>THE SAME NIGHT -- THE FIR PLANTATION


<p/>AMONG the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had
voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the
services of a bailiff, was the particular one of looking
round the homestead before going to bed, to see that
all was right and safe for the night. Gabriel had almost
constantly preceded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in this tour every evening,
watching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affairs as carefully as any specially appointed
officer of surveillance could have done; but this tender
devotion was to a great extent unknown to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) mistress,
and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly
received. Women are never tired of bewailing man's
fickleness in love, but they only seem to snub his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) con-
stancy.
As watching is best done invisibly, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) usually carried
a dark lantern in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand, and every now and then
turned on the light to examine nooks and corners with
the coolness of a metropolitan policeman. This cool-
ness may have owed its existence not so much to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
fearlessness of expected danger as to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) freedom from
the suspicion of any; her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) worst anticipated discovery
being that a horse might not be well bedded, the fowls
not all in, or a door not closed.
This night the buildings were inspected as usual,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) went round to the farm paddock. Here the
only sounds disturbing the stillness were steady munch-
ings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from all
but invisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the
blowing of bellows slowly. Then the munching would
recommence, when the lively imagination might assist
the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils, shaped
as caverns, and very clammy and humid on their sur-
faces, not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got
used to them; the mouths beneath having a great
partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathsheba's
apparel which came within reach of their tongues.
Above each of these a still keener vision suggested a
brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly
eyes, and above all a pair of whitish crescent-shaped
horns like two particularly new moons, an occasional
stolid <div class="bookquote">'' moo!''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>proclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt
that these phenomena were the features and persons of
Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonny-lass, Jolly-O, Spot, Twinkle-eye,
etc., etc. -- the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging
to Bathsheba aforesaid.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Daisy</b></font>) way back to the house was by a path through a
young plantation of tapering firs, which had been planted
some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north
wind. By reason of the density of the interwoven foliage
overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide,
twilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and
black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight. To
describe the spot is to call it a vast, low, naturally formed
hall, the plumy ceiling of which was supported by slender
pillars of living wood, the floor being covered with a soft
dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with
a tuft of grass-blades here and there.
This bit of the path was always the crux of the
night's ramble, though, before starting, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) apprehen-
sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to
take a companion. Slipping along here covertly as
Time, Bathsheba fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could hear footsteps enter-
ing the track at the opposite end. It was certainly a
rustle of footsteps. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own instantly fell as gently as
snowflakes. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) reassured herself by a remembrance
that the path was public, and that the traveller was
probably some villager returning home; regetting, at
the same time, that the meeting should be about to
occur in the darkest point of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) route, even though
only just outside her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own door.
The noise approached, came close, and a figure was
apparently on the point of gliding past her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) when some-
thing tugged at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) skirt and pinned it forcibly to the
ground. The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath-
sheba off her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) balance. In recovering she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) struck against
warm clothes and buttons.
<div class="bookquote">``A rum start, upon my soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a masculine voice,
a foot or so above her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Have I hurt you, mate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink a way.
<div class="bookquote">``We have got hitched together somehow, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you a woman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A lady, I should have said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am a man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that a dark lantern you have? I fancy so.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the man.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you'll allow me I'll open it, and set you free.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>A hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the
rays burst out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) position with astonishment.
The man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was hooked was brilliant in
brass and scarlet. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a soldier. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sudden
appearance was to darkness what the sound of a trumpet
is to silense. Gloom, the genius loci at all times hitherto,
was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern-light
than by what the lantern lighted. The contrast of this
revelation with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) anticipations of some sinister figure
in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the
effect of a fairy transformation.
It was immediately apparent that the military man's
spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught a view of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll unfasten you in one moment, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said,
with new-born gallantry.
<div class="bookquote">``O no -- I can do it, thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hastily replied,
and stooped for the performance.
The unfastening was not such a trifling affair. The
rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
cords in those few moments, that separation was likely
to be a matter of time.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too stooped, and the lantern standing on the
ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side
among the fir-tree needles and the blades of long damp
grass with the effect of a large glowworm. It radiated
upwards into their faces, and sent over half the planta-
tion gigantic shadows of both man and woman, each
dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the
tree-trunks till it wasted to nothing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked hard into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised them
for a moment; Bathsheba looked down again, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gaze was too strong to be received point-blank with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had obliquely noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was young
and slim, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore three chevrons upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sleeve.
Bathsheba pulled again.
<div class="bookquote">``You are a prisoner, miss; it is no use blinking the
matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier, drily. <div class="bookquote">``I must cut your dress
if you are in such a hurry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- please do!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, helplessly. ''
``It wouldn't be necessary if you could wait a
moment,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) unwound a cord from the little
wheel. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own hand, but, whether by
accident or design, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) touched it. Bathsheba was
vexed; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hardly knew why.
His (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed
coming to no end. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) again.
``Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!<div class="bookquote">''
said the young sergeant, without ceremony.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coloured with embarrassment. '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'Twas un-
willingly shown.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) replied, stiffly, and with as much
dignity -- which was very little -- as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could infuse into
a position of captivity
``I like you the better for that incivility, miss.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
said.
``I should have liked -- I wish -- you had never shown
yourself to me by intruding here!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pulled again,
and the gathers of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress began to give way like
liliputian musketry.
``I deserve the chastisement your words give me.
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
an aversion to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's sex?''
``Go on your way, please.''
``What, Beauty, and drag you after me? Do but
look; I never saw such a tangle!''
``O, `tis shameful of you; you have been making
it worse on purpose to keep me here -- you have!''
``Indeed, I don't think so.'' said the sergeant, with a
merry twinkle.
``I tell you you have!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, in high
temper. I insist upon undoing it. Now, allow me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, miss; I am not of steel.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) added a
sigh which had as much archness in it as a sigh could
possess without losing its nature altogether. <div class="bookquote">``I am
thankful for beauty, even when `tis thrown to me like
a bone to a dog. These moments will be over too
soon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips in a determined silence.
Bathsheba was revolving in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind whether by a
bold and desperate rush she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could free herself at the
risk of leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt bodily behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The
thought was too dreadful. The dress -- which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
put on to appear stately at the supper -- was the head
and front of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wardrobe; not another in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stock
became her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so well. What woman in Bathsheba's
position, not naturally timid, and within call of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing
soldier at so dear a price?
<div class="bookquote">``All in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive,''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cool friend.
<div class="bookquote">``This trifling provokes, and -- and -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not too cruel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''-- Insults me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is done in order that I may have the pleasure
of apologizing to so charming a woman, which I
straightway do most humbly, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, bowing
low.
Bathsheba really knew not what to say.
``I've seen a good many women in my time,
continued the young man in a murmur, and more
thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) bent
head at the same time; ``but I've never seen a woman
so beautiful as you. Take it or leave it -- be offended
or like it -- I don't care.''
``Who are you, then, who can so well afford to
despise opinion?''
``No stranger. Sergeant Troy. I am staying in
this place. -- There! it is undone at last, you see.
Your light fingers were more eager than mine. I wish it
had been the knot of knots, which there's no untying!''
This was worse and worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started up, and so
did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). How to decently get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) -- that
was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) difficulty now. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sidled off inch by inch,
the lantern in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see the redness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) coat no longer.
``Ah, Beauty; good-bye!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made no reply, and, reaching a distance of
twenty or thirty yards, turned about, and ran indoors.
Liddy had just retired to rest. In ascending to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own chamber, Bathsheba opened the girl's door an
inch or two, and, panting, said --
``Liddy, is any soldier staying in the village --
sergeant somebody -- rather gentlemanly for a sergeant,
and good looking -- a red coat with blue facings?''
``No, miss ... No, I say; but really it might be
Sergeant Troy home on furlough, though I have not
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) was here once in that way when the
regiment was at Casterbridge.''
``Yes; that's the name. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) a moustache -- no
whiskers or beard?''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) had.''
``What kind of a person is he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)?''
``O! miss -- I blush to name it -- a gay man! But
I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be very quick and trim, who might have
made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousands, like a squire. Such a clever
young dandy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a doctor's son by name,
which is a great deal; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s an earl's son by
nature!''
``Which is a great deal more. Fancy! Is it true?''
``Yes. And, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was brought up so well, and sent to
Casterbridge Grammar School for years and years.
Learnt all languages while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was there; and it was
said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got on so far that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could take down Chinese
in shorthand; but that I don't answer for, as it was
only reported. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gifted lot,
and listed a soldier; but even then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose to be a
sergeant without trying at all. Ah! such a blessing it
is to be high-born; nobility of blood will shine out even
in the ranks and files. And is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really come home,
miss?''
``I believe so. Good-night, Liddy.<div class="bookquote">''
After all, how could a cheerful wearer of skirts
be permanently offended with the man? There are
occasions when girls like Bathsheba will put up with
a great deal of unconventional behaviour. When they
want to be praised, which is often, when they want to
be mastered, which is sometimes; and when they want
no nonsense, which is seldom. Just now the first
feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a dash
of the second. Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the
ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better
days.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not clearly decide whether it was her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) or not. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was ever anything so odd!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) at last exclaimed
to herself, in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own room. <div class="bookquote">``And was ever anything
so meanly done as what I did do to sulk away like that
from a man who was only civil and kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Clearly she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
did not think his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) barefaced praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) person an
insult now.
It was a fatal omission of Boldwood's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had
never once told her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was beautiful.




<p/>CHAPTER XXV



<p/>THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED


<p/>IDIOSYNCRASY and vicissitude had combined to
stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) was a man to whom memories were an in-
cumbrance, and anticipations a superfluity. Simply
feeling, considering, and caring for what was before his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)
eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) was vulnerable only in the present. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) out-
look upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now
and then: that projection of consciousness into days
gone by and to come, which makes the past a synonym
for the pathetic and the future a word for circum-
spection, was foreign to Troy. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) the past
was yesterday; the future, to-morrow; never, the day
after.
On this account he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) might, in certain lights, have
been regarded as one of the most fortunate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)
order. For it may be argued with great plausibility
that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease,
and that expectation in its only comfortable form -- that
of absolute faith -- is practically an impossibility; whilst
in the form of hope and the secondary compounds,
patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a constant
fluctuation between pleasure and pain.
Sergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the
practice of expectation, was never disappointed. To
set against this negative gain there may have been
some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the
higher tastes and sensations which it entailed. But
limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss
by the loser therefrom: in this attribute moral or
aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, since
those who suffer do not mind it, whilst those who mind
it soon cease to suffer. It is not a denial of anything
to have been always without it, and what Troy had
never enjoyed he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not miss; but, being fully
conscious that what sober people missed he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) enjoyed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) capacity, though really less, seemed greater than
theirs.
He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was moderately truthful towards men, but to
women lied like a Cretan -- a system of ethics above all
others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of
admission into lively society; and the possibility of the
favour gained being transitory had reference only to
the future.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) never passed the line which divides the spruce
vices from the ugly; and hence, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) morals had
hardly been applauded, disapproval of them'' had fre-
quently been tempered with a smile. This treatment
had led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) becoming a sort of regrater of other
men's gallantries, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) own aggrandizement as a
Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>)
hearers.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) reason and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) propensities had seldom any
reciprocating influence, having separated by mutual
consent long ago: thence it sometimes happened that,
while his (<font color='blue'><b>Cretan</b></font>) intentions were as honourable as could be
wished, any particular deed formed a dark background
which threw them into fine relief. The sergeant's
vicious phases being the offspring of impulse, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter
had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than
seen.
Troy was full of activity, but his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) activities were less of
a locomotive than a vegetative nature; and, never being
based upon any original choice of foundation or direc-
tion, they were exercised on whatever object chance
might place in their way. Hence, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) sometimes
reached the brilliant in speech because that -was
spontaneous, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) fell below the commonplace in action,
from inability to guide incipient effort. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had a
quick comprehension and considerable force of char-
acter; but, being without the power to combine them,
the comprehension became engaged with trivialities
whilst waiting for the will to direct it, and the force
wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the
comprehension.
He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle
class -- exceptionally well educated for a common soldier.
He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) spoke fluently and unceasingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) could in this
way be one thing and seem another: for instance, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
could speak of love and think of dinner; call on the
intend to owe.
The wondrous power of flattery in passados at woman
is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
many people almost as automatically as they repeat a
proverb, or say that they are Christians and the like,
without thinking much of the enormous corollaries
which spring from the proposition. Still less is it acted
upon for the good of the complemental being alluded
to. With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
all those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home.
When expressed with some amount of reflectiveness it
seems co-ordinate with a belief that this flattery must
be reasonable to be effective. It is to the credit of
men that few attempt to settle the question by experi-
ment, and it is for their happiness, perhaps, that accident
has never settled it for them. Nevertheless, that a
male dissembler who by deluging her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) with untenable
fictions charms the female wisely, may acquire powers
reaching to the extremity of perdition, is a truth taught
to many by unsought and wringing occurrences. And
some profess to have attained to the same knowledge
by experiment as aforesaid, and jauntily continue their
indulgence in such experiments with terrible effect.
Sergeant Troy was one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) had been known to observe casually that in
dealing with womankind the only alternative to flattery
was cursing and swearing. There was no third method.
<div class="bookquote">``Treat them fairly, and you are a lost man.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) would
say.
This philosopher's public appearance in Weatherbury
promptly followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) arrival there. A week or two
after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a nameless relief
of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence, approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the
haymakers. They consisted in about equal proportions
of gnarled and flexuous forms, the former being the
men, the latter the women, who wore tilt bonnets
covered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon
their shoulders. Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing
in a less forward meadow, Clark humming a tune to
the strokes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) scythe, to which Jan made no attempt
to keep time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>). In the first mead they were
already loading hay, the women raking it into cocks
and windrows, and the men tossing it upon the
waggon.
From behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot
emerged, and went on loading unconcernedly with the
rest. It was the gallant sergeant, who had come hay-
making for pleasure; and nobody could deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
was doing the mistress of the farm real knight-service
by this voluntary contribution of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) labour at a busy
time.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had entered the field Troy saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>),
and sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) pitchfork into the ground and picking
up his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) crop or cane, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) came forward. Bathsheba
blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and adjusted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) eyes as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) feet to the direct line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
path.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVI



<p/>SCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD


<p/><div class="bookquote">``AH, Miss Everdene!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
diminutive cap. ``Little did I think it was you I was
speaking to the other night. And yet, if I had reflected,
the ``Queen of the Corn-market'' -LRB-truth is truth at any
hour of the day or night, and I heard you so named in
Casterbridge yesterday-RRB-, the ``Queen of the Corn-market.<div class="bookquote">''
I say, could be no other woman. I step across now to
beg your forgiveness a thousand times for having been
led by my feelings to express myself too strongly for a
stranger. To be sure I am no stranger to the place --
I am Sergeant Troy, as I told you, and I have assisted
your uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a
lad. I have been doing the same for you today.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant
Troy.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen of the Corn-market, in an in-
differently grateful tone.
The sergeant looked hurt and sad. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed you
must not, Miss Everdene.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why could you
think such a thing necessary?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am glad it is not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why? if I may ask without offence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because I don't much want to thank you for any''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thing.''
``I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue
that my heart will never mend. O these intolerable
times: that ill-luck should follow a man for honestly
telling a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is beautiful! <div class="bookquote">``Twas the most I
said -- you must own that; and the least I could say --
that I own myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There is some talk I could do without more easily
than money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed. That remark is a sort of digression.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. It means that I would rather have your room
than your company.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And I would rather have curses from you than
kisses from any other woman; so I'll stay here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba was absolutely speechless. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)
could not help feeling that the assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was render-
ing forbade a harsh repulse.
<div class="bookquote">``Well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Troy, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose there is a praise
which is rudeness, and that may be mine. At the
same time there is a treatment which is injustice, and
that may be yours. Because a plain blunt man, who
has never been taught concealment, speaks out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
mind without exactly intending it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s to be snapped
off like the son of a sinner.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed there's no such case between us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said,
turning away. <div class="bookquote">``I don't allow strangers to be bold and
impudent -- even in praise of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah -- it is not the fact but the method which offends
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said, carelessly. <div class="bookquote">``But I have the sad satis-
faction of knowing that my words, whether pleasing or
offensive, are unmistakably true. Would you have had
me look at you, and tell my acquaintance that you are
quite a common-place woman, to save you the embar-
rassment of being stared at if they come near you?
Not I. I couldn't tell any such ridiculous lie about
a beauty to encourage a single woman in England in
too excessive a modesty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is all pretence -- what you are saying!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Bathsheba, laughing in spite of herself at the sergeant's
sly method. <div class="bookquote">``You have a rare invention, Sergeant
Troy. Why couldn't you have passed by me that
night, and said nothing? -- that was all I meant to
reproach you for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because I wasn't going to. Half the pleasure of
a feeling lies in being able to express it on the spur of
the moment, and I let out mine. It would have been
just the same if you had been the reverse person -- ugly
and old -- I should have exclaimed about it in the same
way. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How long is it since you have been so afflicted with
strong feeling, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness
from deformity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you
speak of doesn't stop at faces, but extends to morals as
well. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't speak of morals or religion -- my own or
anybody else's. Though perhaps I should have been a
very good Christian if you pretty women hadn't made
me an idolater.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba moved on to hide the irrepressible dimp-
lings of merriment. Troy followed, whirling his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) crop.
<div class="bookquote">``But -- Miss Everdene -- you do forgive me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hardly. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You say such things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I said you were beautiful, and I'll say so still; for,
by -- so you are! The most beautiful ever I saw, or
may I fall dead this instant! Why, upon my -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't -- don't! I won't listen to you -- you are so
profane!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, in a restless state between distress
at hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) and a penchant to hear more.
<div class="bookquote">``I again say you are a most fascinating woman.
There's nothing remarkable in my saying so, is there?
I'm sure the fact is evident enough. Miss Everdene,
my opinion may be too forcibly let out to please you,
and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to convince
you, but surely it is honest, and why can't it be ex-
cused? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because it -- it isn't a correct one.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) femininely
murmured.
<div class="bookquote">``O, fie -- fie-! Am I any worse for breaking the
third of that Terrible Ten than you for breaking the
ninth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, it doesn't seem quite true to me that I am
fascinating.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) replied evasively.
<div class="bookquote">``Not so to you: then I say with all respect that, if
so, it is owing to your modesty, Miss Everdene. But
surely you must have been told by everybody of what
everybody notices? and you should take their words
for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They don't say so exactly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes, they must!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean to my face, as you do.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went on,
allowing herself to be further lured into a conversation
that intention had rigorously forbidden.
<div class="bookquote">``But you know they think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- that is -- I certainly have heard Liddy say
they do, but -- --''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) paused.
Capitulation -- that was the purport of the simple
reply, guarded as it was -- capitulation, unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)-
self. Never did a fragile tailless sentence convey a
more perfect meaning. The careless sergeant smiled
within himself, and probably too the devil smiled from
a loop-hole in Tophet, for the moment was the turning-
point of a career. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) tone and mien signified beyond
mistake that the seed which was to lift the foundation
had taken root in the chink: the remainder was a mere
question of time and natural changes.
<div class="bookquote">``There the truth comes out!''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier, in
reply. <div class="bookquote">``Never tell me that a young lady can live in a
buzz of admiration without knowing something about it.
Ah.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>well, Miss Everdene, you are -- pardon my blunt
way -- you are rather an injury to our race than other-
wise.
<div class="bookquote">``How -- indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``O, it is true enough. I may as well be hung for
a sheep as a lamb -LRB-an old country saying, not of much
account, but it will do for a rough soldier-RRB-, and so I
will speak my mind, regardless of your pleasure, and
without hoping or intending to get your pardon. Why,
Miss Everdene, it is in this manner that your good
looks may do more. harm than good in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The sergeant</b></font>)</div>The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstrac-
ion. <div class="bookquote">``Probably some one man on an average falls in''
 (<font color='red'><b>each woman</b></font>)</div>love, with each ordinary woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can marry him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>):
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) is content, and leads a useful life. Such women as
you a hundred men always covet -- your eyes will be-
witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you
you can only marry one of that many. Out of these
say twenty will endeavour to. drown the bitterness of
espised love in drink; twenty more will mope away
their lives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in
he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) world, because they have no ambition apart from
their attachment to you; twenty more -- the susceptible
person myself possibly among them -- will be always
draggling after you, getting where they may just see
you, doing desperate things. Men are such constant
fools! The rest may try to get over their passion with
more or less success. But all these men will be
saddened. And not only those ninety-nine men, but
the ninety-nine women they might have married are
saddened with them. There's my tale. That's why I
say that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss Ever-
dene, is hardly a blessing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) race.''
The handsome sergeant's features were during this
speech as rigid and stern as John Knox's in addressing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Knox</b></font>) gay young queen.
Seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) made no reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knox</b></font>) said, ``Do you read
French?''
``No; I began, but when I got to the verbs, father
died.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) said simply.
``I do -- when I have an opportunity, which latterly
has not been often -LRB-my mother was a Parisienne-RRB- -- and
there's a proverb they have, Qui aime bien chatie bien
-- <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chastens who loves well.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother a Parisienne</b></font>)</div>Do you understand
me?
<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) replied, and there was even a little tremu-
lousness in the usually cool girl's voice; <div class="bookquote">``if you can
only fight half as winningly as you can talk, you are
able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And
then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slip in
making this admission: in hastily trying to retrieve it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went from bad to worse. <div class="bookquote">``Don't, however, suppose
that I derive any pleasure from what you tell me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know you do not -- I know it perfectly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy,
with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knox</b></font>) face:
and altering the expression to moodiness; <div class="bookquote">``when a
dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you, and
give the admiration you deserve without adding the
warning you need, it stands to reason that my poor
rough-and-ready mixture of praise and blame cannot
convey much pleasure. Fool as I may be, I am not so
conceited as to suppose that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you -- are conceited, nevertheless.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said
Bathsheba, looking askance at a reed she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fitfully
pulling with one hand, having lately grown feverish
under the soldier's system of procedure -- not because
the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) cajolery was entirely unperceived, but
because its vigour was overwhelming.
<div class="bookquote">``I would not own it to anybody else -- nor do I
exactly to you. Still, there might have been some self-
conceit in my foolish supposition the other night. I
knew that what I said in admiration might be an
opinion too often forced upon you to give any pleasure
but I certainly did think that the kindness of your
nature might prevent you judging an uncontrolled
tongue harshly -- which you have done -- and thinking
badly of me and wounding me this morning, when I
am working hard to save your hay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, you need not think more of that: perhaps you
did not mean to be rude to me by speaking out your
mind: indeed, I believe you did not.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the shrewd
woman, in painfully innocent earnest. <div class="bookquote">``And I thank
you for giving help here. But -- but mind you don't
speak to me again in that way, or in any other, unless
I speak to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Miss Bathsheba! That is to hard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, it isn't. Why is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will never speak to me; for I shall not be
here long. I am soon going back again to the miser-
able monotony of drill -- and perhaps our regiment will
be ordered out soon. And yet you take away the one
little ewe-lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life
of mine. Well, perhaps generosity is not a woman's
most marked characteristic.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``When are you going from here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, with
some interest.
<div class="bookquote">``In a month.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you ask Miss Everdene -- knowing as you do
-- what my offence is based on?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I you do care so much for a silly trifle of that
kind, then, I don't mind doing it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncertainly and
doubtingly answered. <div class="bookquote">``But you can't really care for a
word from me? you only say so -- I think you only
say so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``that's unjust -- but I won't repeat the remark. I
am too gratified to get such a mark of your friendship
at any price to cavil at the tone. I do Miss Everdene,
care for it. You may think a man foolish to want a
mere word -- just a good morning. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is -- I
don't know. But you have never been a man looking
upon a woman, and that woman yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you know nothing of what such an experience
is like -- and Heaven forbid that you ever should!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, flatterer! What is it like? I am
interested in knowing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Put shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or
look in any direction except one without wretchedness,
nor there without torture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sergeant, it won't do -- you are pretending!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head.<div class="bookquote">'' Your words are too dashing
to be true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not, upon the honour of a soldier''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why is it so? -- Of course I ask for mere pas-
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Because you are so distracting -- and I am so
distracted. ''
``You look like it.''
``I am indeed.''
``Why, you only saw me the other night!''
``That makes no difference. The lightning works in-
stantaneously. I loved you then, at once -- as I do now.''
Bathsheba surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) curiously, from the feet
upward, as high as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liked to venture her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glance,
which was not quite so high as his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) eyes.
``You cannot and you don<div class="bookquote">``t.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said demurely.
<div class="bookquote">``There is-no such sudden feeling in people. I won't
listen to you any longer. Hear me, I wish I knew what
o'clock it is -- I am going -- I have wasted too much time
here already!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The sergeant</b></font>)</div>The sergeant looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) watch and told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``What, haven't you a watch, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) inquired.
<div class="bookquote">``I have not just at present -- I am about to get a
new one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. You shall be given one. Yes -- you shall.
A gift, Miss Everdene -- a gift.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew what the young -- man was
intending, a heavy gold watch was in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``It is an unusually good one for a man like me to
possess.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quietly said. <div class="bookquote">``That watch has a history.
Press the spring and open the back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did so.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A crest and a motto.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``A coronet with five points, and beneath, Cedit amor
rebus -- ``Love yields to circumstance.'' It's the motto
of the Earls of Severn. That watch belonged to the
last lord, and was given to my mother's husband, a
medical man, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) use till I came of age, when it was
to be given to me. It was all the fortune that ever I
inherited. That watch has regulated imperial interests
in its time -- the stately ceremonial, the courtly assigna-
tion, pompous travels, and lordly sleeps. Now it is
yours.
``But, Sergeant Troy, I cannot take this -- I cannot!''
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, with round-eyed wonder. ``A gold watch!
What are you doing? Don't be such a dissembler!''
The sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)
gift, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) held out persistently towards him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>).
Bathsheba followed as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) retired.
``Keep it -- do, Miss Everdene -- keep it!'' said the
erratic child of impulse. ``The fact of your possessing
it makes it worth ten times as much to me. A more
plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and
the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats
against -- well, I won't speak of that. It is in far
worthier hands than ever it has been in before.''
``But indeed I can't have it!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in a perfect
simmer of distress. ``O, how can you do such a thing;
that is if you really mean it! Give me your dead
father's watch, and such a valuable one! You should
not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!''
``I loved my father: good; but better, I love you
more. That's how I can do it.'' said the sergeant, with
an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it.
was evidently not all acted now. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beauty, which,
whilst it had been quiescent, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had praised in jest,
had in its animated phases moved him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) to earnest; and
though his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) seriousness was less than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) imagined, it
was probably more than he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) imagined himself.
Bathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in half-suspicious accents of feeling, ``Can
it be! O, how can it be, that you care for me, and
so suddenly,! You have seen so little of me: I may
not be really so -- so nice-looking as I seem to you.
Please, do take it; O, do! I cannot and will not have
it. Believe me, your generosity is too great. I have
never done you a single kindness, and why should you
be so kind to me?''
A factitious reply had been again upon his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) lips, but
it was again suspended, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with an
arrested eye. The truth was, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) now stood --
excited, wild, and honest as the day -- her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) alluring
beauty bore out so fully the epithets he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had bestowed
upon it that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was quite startled at his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) temerity in
advancing them as false. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said mechanically, ``Ah,
why?'' and continued to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
``And my workfolk see me following you about the
field, and are wondering. O, this is dreadful!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
went on, unconscious of the transmutation she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
effecting.
``I did not quite mean you to accept it at first, for it
as my one poor patent of nobility.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) broke out,
bluntly; ``but, upon my soul, I wish you would now.
Without any shamming, come! Don't deny me the
happiness of wearing it for my sake? But you are too
lovely even to care to be kind as others are.''
``No, no; don<div class="bookquote">``t say so! I have reasons for reserve
which I cannot explain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``bet it be, then, let it be.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said, receiving back
the watch at last; <div class="bookquote">``I must be leaving you now. And
will you speak to me for these few weeks of my stay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I will. Yet, I don't know if I will! O,
why did you come and disturb me so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself.
Such things have happened. Well, will you let me
work in your fields?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) coaxed.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so; if it is any pleasure to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Miss Everdene, I thank you.
``No, no.''
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The sergeant brought his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) hand to the cap on the
slope of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) head, saluted, and returned to the distant
group of haymakers.
Bathsheba could not face the haymakers now. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
heart erratically flitting hither and thither from per-
plexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) retreated
homeward, murmuring, O, what have I done! What
does it mean! I wish I knew how much of it was
true!




<p/>CHAPTER XXVII



<p/>HIVING THE BEES


<p/>THE Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this
year. It was in the latter part of June, and the day after
the interview with Troy in the hayfield, that Bathsheba
was standing in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) garden, watching a swarm in the
air and guessing their probable settling place. Not only
were they late this year, but unruly. Sometimes through-
out a whole season all the swarms would alight on the
lowest attainable bough -- such as part of a currant-bush
or espalier apple-tree; next year they would, with just
the same unanimity, make straight off to the uppermost
member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden,
and there defy all invaders who did not come armed
with ladders and staves to take them.
This was the case at present. Bathsheba's eyes,
shaded by one hand, were following the ascending
multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue till
they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees
spoken of. A process somewhat analogous to that of
alleged formations of the universe, time and times ago,
was observable. The bustling swarm had swept the sky
in a scattered and uniform haze, which now thickened to
a nebulous centre: this glided on to a bough and grew
still denser, till it formed a solid black spot upon the
light.
The men and women being all busily engaged in
saving the hay -- even Liddy had left the house for the
purpose of lending a hand -- Bathsheba resolved to hive
the bees herself, if possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had dressed the hive
with herbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and
crook, made herself impregnable with armour of leather
gloves, straw hat, and large gauze veil -- once green but
now faded to snuff colour -- and ascended a dozen rungs
of the ladder. At once she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) heard, not ten yards off,
a voice that was beginning to have a strange power in
agitating her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Miss Everdene, let me assist you; you should not
attempt such a thing alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy was just opening the garden gate.
Bathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty
hive, pulled the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) dress tightly round her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>)
ankles in a tremendous flurry, and as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) could
slid down the ladder. By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) reached the
bottom Troy was there also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) stooped to pick
up the hive.
<div class="bookquote">``How fortunate I am to have dropped in at this
moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the sergeant.
She (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) voice in a minute. <div class="bookquote">``What! and will
you shake them in for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) asked, in what, for a
defiant girl, was a faltering way; though, for a timid
girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.
<div class="bookquote">``Will I!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy. <div class="bookquote">``Why, of course I will. How
blooming you are to-day!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) cane
and put his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) foot on the ladder to ascend.
<div class="bookquote">``But you must have on the veil and gloves, or you'll
be stung fearfully!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes. I must put on the veil and gloves. Will
you kindly show me how to fix them properly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you must have the broad-brimmed hat, too, for
your cap has no brim to keep the veil off, and they'd
reach your face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The broad-brimmed hat, too, by all means.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So a whimsical fate ordered that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hat should be
taken off -- veil and all attached -- and placed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>)
head, Troy tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) own into a gooseberry bush.
Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round
his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) collar and the gloves put on him (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) looked such an extraordinary object in this guise
that, flurried as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not avoid laughing
outright. It was the removal of yet another stake from
the palisade of cold manners which had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) off
Bathsheba looked on from the ground whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) was
busy sweeping and shaking the bees from the tree,
holding up the hive with the other hand for them to
fall into. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made use of an unobserved minute
whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) attention was absorbed in the operation to
arrange her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plumes a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) came down holding
the hive at arm's length, behind which trailed a cloud
of bees.
<div class="bookquote">``Upon my life.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, through the veil,<div class="bookquote">'' holding
up this hive makes one's arm ache worse than a week
of sword-exercise.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When the manoeuvre was complete
he (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Would you be good enough to
untie me and let me out? I am nearly stifled inside
this silk cage.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>To hide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) embarrassment during the unwonted
process of untying the string about his (<font color='blue'><b>crook</b></font>) neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said: --
<div class="bookquote">``I have never seen that you spoke of.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The sword-exercise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! would you like to?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy.
Bathsheba hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had heard wondrous
reports from time to time by dwellers in Weatherbury,
who had by chance sojourned awhile in Casterbridge,
near the barracks, of this strange and glorious perform-
ance, *tlie sword-exercise. Men and boys who had
peeped through chinks or over walls into the barrack-
yard returned with accounts of its being the most
flashing affair conceivable; accoutrements and weapons
glistening like stars-here,there,around-yet all by rule
and compass. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said mildly what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt strongly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; I should like to see it very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And so you shall; you shall see me go through it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No! How?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let me consider.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not with a walking-stick -- I don't care to see that.
lt must be a real sword.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know; and I have no sword here; but I
think I could get one by the evening. Now, will you
do this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, blushing.'' Thank
you very much, but I couldn't on any account.
``Surely you might? Nobody would know.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head, but with a weakened negation.
``If I were to.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, ``I must bring Liddy too. Might
I not?''
Troy looked far away. ``I don't see why you want
to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>).'' he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said coldly.
An unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba's eyes
betrayed that something more than his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coldness had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) also feel that Liddy Would be superfluous in
the suggested scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had felt it, even whilst making
the proposal.
``Well, I won't bring Liddy -- and I'll come. But
only for a very short time.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added; ``a very short
time.''
<div class="bookquote">``It will not take five minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy.




<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII



<p/>THE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS


<p/>THE hill opposite Bathsheba's dwelling extended, a
mile off, into an uncultivated tract of land, dotted at
this season with tall thickets of brake fern, plump and
diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and radiant in
hues of clear and untainted green.
At eight o'clock this midsummer evening, whilst the
bristling ball of gold in the west still swept the tips of
the ferns with its long, luxuriant rays, a soft brushing-
by of garments might have been heard among them,
and Bathsheba appeared in their midst, their soft,
feathery arms caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) up to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
paused, turned, went back over the hill and half-way
to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own door, whence she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) cast a farewell glance upon
the spot she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had just left, having resolved not to remain
near the place after all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round
the shoulder of the rise. It disappeared on the other
side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) waited one minute -- two minutes -- thought of
Troy's disappointment at her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) non-fulfilment of a promised
engagement, till she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) again ran along the field, clambered
over the bank, and followed the original direction. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was now literally trembling and panting at this her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
temerity in such an errant undertaking; her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) breath
came and went quickly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eyes shone with an in-
frequent light. Yet go she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) must. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) reached the
verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns. Troy stood
in the bottom, looking up towards her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I heard you rustling through the fern before I saw
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, coming up and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand to help
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) down the slope.
The pit was a saucer-shaped concave, naturally
formed, with a top diameter of about thirty feet, and
shallow enough to allow the sunshine to reach their
heads. Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was
met by a circular horizon of fern: this grew nearly to
the bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased. The
middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a
thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled, so
yielding that the foot was half-buried within it.
<div class="bookquote">``Now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Troy, producing the sword, which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
raised it into the sunlight, gleamed a sort of greeting,
like a living thing, <div class="bookquote">``first, we have four right and four
left cuts; four right and four left thrusts. Infantry cuts
and guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;
but they are not so swashing. They have seven cuts
and three thrusts. So much as a preliminary. Well,
next, our cut one is as if you were sowing your corn --
so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in
the air, and Troy's arm was still again. <div class="bookquote">``Cut two, as if
you were hedging -- so. Three, as if you were reaping
-- so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Four, as if you were threshing -- in that way.
<div class="bookquote">``Then the same on the left. The thrusts are these: one,
two, three, four, right; one, two, three, four, left.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
repeated them. <div class="bookquote">``Have 'em again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``One,
two -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hurriedly interrupted: <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather not; though
I don't mind your twos and fours; but your ones and
threes are terrible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I'll let you off the ones and threes.
Next, cuts, points and guards altogether.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy duly
exhibited them. <div class="bookquote">``Then there's pursuing practice, in
this way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) gave the movements as before. <div class="bookquote">``There,
those are the stereotyped forms. The infantry have
two most diabolical upward cuts, which we are too
humane to use. Like this -- three, four.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How murderous and bloodthirsty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are rather deathy. Now I'll be more inter-
esting, and let you see some loose play -- giving all the
cuts and points, infantry and cavalry, quicker than
lightning, and as promiscuously -- with just enough rule
to regulate instinct and yet not to fetter it. You are
my antagonist, with this difference from real warfare,
that I shall miss you every time by one hair's breadth,
or perhaps two. Mind you don't flinch, whatever you
do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'll be sure not to!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said invincibly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) pointed to about a yard in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
Bathsheba's adventurous spirit was beginning to find
some grains of relish in these highly novel proceedings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) position as directed, facing Troy.
``Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough
to let me do what I wish, I'll give you a preliminary
test.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) flourished the sword by way of introduction
number two, and the next thing of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was
conscious was that the point and blade of the sword
were darting with a gleam towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) left side, just
above her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hip; then of their reappearance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) right
side, emerging as it were from between her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) ribs, having
apparently passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) body. The third item
of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword,
perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in
Troy's hand -LRB-in the position technically called ``recover
swords''-RRB-. All was as quick as electricity.
``Oh!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) cried out in affright, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) side.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Have you run me through? -- no, you have
not! Whatever have you done!''
``I have not touched you.'' said Troy, quietly. ``It
was mere sleight of hand. The sword passed behind
you. Now you are not afraid, are you? Because if
you are l can't perform. I give my word that l will
not only not hurt you, but not once touch you.''
``I don't think I am afraid. You are quite sure you
will not hurt me?''
``Quite sure.''
``Is the sWord very sharp?''
``O no -- only stand as still as a statue. Now!''
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to
Bathsheba's eyes. Beams of light caught from the low
sun's rays, above, around, in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), well-nigh shut
out earth and heaven -- all emitted in the marvellous
evolutions of Troy's reflecting blade, which seemed
everywhere at once, and yet nowherre specially. These
circling gleams were accompanied by a keen rush that
was almost a whistling -- also springing from all sides of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) at once. In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was enclosed in a firmament
of light, and of sharp hisses, resembling a sky-full of
meteors close at hand.
Never since the broadsword became the national
weapon had there been more dexterity shown in its
management than by the hands of Sergeant Troy, and
never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) been in such splendid temper for the
performance as now in the evening sunshine among the
ferns with Bathsheba. It may safely be asserted with
respect to the closeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) cuts, that had it been
possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a
permanent substance wherever it flew past, the space
left untouched would have been almost a mould of
Bathsheba's figure.
Behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) could see the hue of Troy's sword arm, spread in a
scarlet haze over the space covered by its motions, like
a twanged harpstring, and behind all Troy himself,
mostly facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>); sometimes, to show the rear cuts,
half turned away, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) eye nevertheless always keenly
measuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) breadth and outline, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) lips tightly
closed in sustained effort. Next, his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) movements lapsed
slower, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) could see them individually. The
hissing of the sword had ceased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) stopped
entirely.
``That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
said, before she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had moved or spoken. <div class="bookquote">``Wait: I'll do
it for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>An arc of silver shone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) right side: the sword
had descended. The lock droped to the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``Bravely borne!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't flinch a
shade's thickness. Wonderful in a woman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was because I didn't expect it. O, you have
spoilt my hair!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only once more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- no! I am afraid of you -- indeed I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
cried.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't touch you at all -- not even your hair. I
am only going to kill that caterpillar settling on you.
Now: still!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It appeared that a caterpillar had come from the
fern and chosen the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) bodice as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) resting
place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) saw the point glisten towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) bosom,
and seemingly enter it. Bathsheba closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) eyes in
the full persuasion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) was killed at last. How-
ever, feeling just as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) opened them again.
<div class="bookquote">``There it is, look.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sargeant</b></font>)</div>said the sargeant, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>)
sword before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) eyes.
The caterpillar was spitted upon its point.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, it is magic!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, amazed.
<div class="bookquote">``O no -- dexterity. I merely gave point to your
bosom where the caterpillar was, and instead of running
you through checked the extension a thousandth of an
inch short of your surface.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But how could you chop off a curl of my hair with
a sword that has no edge?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No edge! This sword will shave like a razor.
Look here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) touched the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) hand with the blade,
and then, lifting it, showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) a thin shaving of scarf-
skin dangling therefrom.
<div class="bookquote">``But you said before beginning that it was blunt and
couldn't cut me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was to get you to stand still, and so make sure
of your safety. The risk of injuring you through your
moving was too great not to force me to tell you a
fib to escape it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) shuddered. <div class="bookquote">``I have been within an inch of my
life, and didn't know it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``More precisely speaking, you have been within half
an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety-five
tinies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cruel, cruel, `tis of you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have been perfectly safe, nevertheless. My
sword never errs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And Troy returned the weapon to
the scabbard.
Bathsheba, overcome by a hundred tumultuous feel-
ings resulting from the scene, abstractedly sat down on
a tuft of heather.
<div class="bookquote">``I must leave you now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, softly. <div class="bookquote">``And I'll
venture to take and keep this in remembrance of you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) stoop to the grass, pick up the winding
lock which he (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) had severed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) manifold tresses,
twist it round his (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) fingers, unfasten a button in the breast
of his (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) coat, and carefully put it inside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) felt power-
less to withstand or deny him (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) was altogether too
much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>), and Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing
a reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops
the breath.
He (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) drew near and said, <div class="bookquote">``I must be leaving you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>) drew nearer still. A minute later and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>sargeant</b></font>)
scarlet form disappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in
a flash, like a brand swiftly waved.
That minute's interval had brought the blood beating
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) face, set her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) stinging as if aflame to the very
hollows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) feet, and enlarged emotion to a compass
which quite swamped thought. It had brought upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) a stroke resulting, as did that of Moses in Horeh, in
a liquid stream -- here a stream of tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) felt like
one who has sinned a great sin.
The circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy's
mouth downwards upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moses</b></font>) had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER XXIX



<p/>PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK


<p/>WE now see the element of folly distinctly mingling
with the many varying particulars which made up the
character of Bathsheba Everdene. It was almost foreign
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) intrinsic nature. Introduced as lymph on the
dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and coloured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) whole constitution. Bathsheba, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) had too
much understanding to be entirely governed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
womanliness, had too much womanliness to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
understanding to the best advantage. Perhaps in no
minor point does woman astonish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) helpmate more
than in the strange power she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) possesses of believing
cajoleries that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knows to be false -- except, indeed, in
that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knows to be true.
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant
women love when they abandon their self-reliance.
When a strong woman recklessly throws away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
strength she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is worse than a weak woman who has never
had any strength to throw away. One source of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
never had practice in making the best of such a
condition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter.
Though in one sense a woman of the world, it was, after
all, that world of daylight coteries and green carpets
wherein cattle form the passing crowd and winds the
busy hum; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives
on the other side of your party-wall, where your neigh-
bour is everybody in the tything, and where calculation
formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all. Had
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) utmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly
worded -LRB-and by herself they never were-RRB-, they would
only have amounted to such a matter as that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impulses to be pleasanter guides than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) discretion .
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love was entire as a child's, and though warm as
summer it was fresh as spring. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) culpability lay in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) making no attempt to control feeling by subtle and
careful inquiry into consciences. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could show others
the steep and thorny way, but `reck'd not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own rede,''
And Troy's deformities lay deep down from a
woman's vision, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) embellishments were upon
the very surface; thus contrasting with homely Oak,
whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose
vertues were as metals in a mine.
The difference between love and respect was mark-
edly shown in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conduct. Bathsheba had spoken of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interest in Boldwood with the greatest freedom to
Liddy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only communed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own heart
concerning ``Troy''.
All this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled
thereby from the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) daily journey a-field to the
time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) return, and on to the small hours of many a
night. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was not beloved had hitherto been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
great that Bathsheba was getting into the toils
was now a sorrow greater than the first, and one which
nearly obscured it. It was a result which paralleled
the oft-quoted observation of Hippocrates concerning
physical pains.
That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love
which not even the fear of breeding aversion in the
bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
or her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) errors. Oak determined to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mistress.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would base his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) appeal on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
unfair treatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from
home.
An opportunity occurred one evening when she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had
gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour-
ing cornfields. It was dusk when Oak, who had not
been far a-field that day, took the same path and met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) returning, quite pensively, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) thought.
The wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow;
thus the way was quite a sunken groove between the
embowing thicket on either side. Two persons could
not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and Oak
stood aside to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pass.
``Oh, is it Gabriel?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said. ``You are taking a
walk too. Good-night.''
``I thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather
late,'' said Oak, turning and following at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heels when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had brushed somewhat quickly by him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>).
``Thank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.''
``O no; but there are bad characters about.''
``I never meet them.''
Now Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going
to introduce the gallant sergeant through the channel of
``bad characters.'' But all at once the scheme broke
down, it suddenly occurring to him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) that this was rather a
clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with. He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) tried
another preamble.
``And as the man who would naturally come to meet
you is away from home, too -- I mean Farmer Boldwood
-- why, thinks I, I'll go.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said.
``Ah, yes.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) walked on without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head,
and for many steps nothing further was heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
quarter than the rustle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) dress against the heavy
corn-ears. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) resumed rather tartly --
``I don't quite understand what you meant by saying
that Mr. Boldwood would naturally come to meet me.<div class="bookquote">''
I meant on account of the wedding which they say
is likely to take place between you and him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>), miss. For-
give my speaking plainly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They say what is not true.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) returned quickly.
No marriage is likely to take place between us.''
Gabriel now put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) unobscured opinion, for
the moment had come. ``Well, Miss Everdene.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
said, ``putting aside what people say, I never in my life
saw any courting if his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) is not a courting of you.''
Bathsheba would probably have terminated the con-
versation there and then by flatly forbidding the subject,
had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) conscious weakness of position allured her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
to palter and argue in endeavours to better it.
``Since this subject has been mentioned.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said
very emphatically, ``I am glad of the opportunity of
clearing up a mistake which is very common and very
provoking. I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwood
anything. I have never cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). I respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) has urged me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). But I have given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) no distinct answer. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) returns I shall
do so; and the answer will be that I cannot think of
marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).''
``People are full of mistakes, seemingly.''
``They are.<div class="bookquote">''
The other day they said you were trifling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>),
and you almost proved that you were not; lately they
have said that you be not, and you straightway begin
to show -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That I am, I suppose you mean.''
``Well, I hope they speak the truth.<div class="bookquote">''
They do, but wrongly applied. I don't trifle with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>); but then, I have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood's
rival in a wrong tone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) after all. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had
never met that young Sergeant Troy, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sighed.

<p/>Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic. <div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) is not good enough for `ee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did any one tell you to speak to me like this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nobody at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not
concern us here.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, intractably.<div class="bookquote">'' Yet I must say
that Sergeant Troy is an educated man, and quite worthy
of any woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) is well born.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) being higher in learning and birth than the
ruck o' soldiers is anything but a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) worth. It
show's his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) course to be down`ard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see what this has to do with our conversa-
tion. Mr. Troy's course is not by any means downward;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) superiority IS a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) worth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) to have no conscience at all. And I
cannot help begging you, miss, to have nothing to do
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Listen to me this once -- only this once!
I don't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)'s such a bad man as I have fancied -- I
pray to God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not. But since we don't exactly
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is, why not behave as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) MIGHT be bad,
simply for your own safety? Don't trust him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), mistress;
I ask you not to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, pray?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like soldiers, but this one I do not like.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) said,
sturdily. ``His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cleverness in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) calling may have
tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) astray, and what is mirth to the neighbours
is ruin to the woman. When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tries to talk to `ee again,
why not turn away with a short ``Good day,'' and when
you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) coming one way, turn the other. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) says anything laughable, fail to see the point
and don't smile, and speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) before those who will
report your talk as ``that fantastical man.<div class="bookquote">'' or ''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>that
Sergeant What's-his-name.'' ``That man of a family
that has come to the dogs.<div class="bookquote">'' Don't be unmannerly
towards en, but harmless-uncivil, and so get rid of the
man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a family</b></font>)</div>No Christmas robin detained by a window-pane ever
pulsed as did Bathsheba now.
I say -- I say again -- that it doesn't become you to
talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be mentioned passes
me quite . she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) exclaimed desperately. <div class="bookquote">``I know this,
th-th-that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a thoroughly conscientious man -- blunt
sometimes even to rudeness -- but always speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as good as anybody in this parish! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
very particular, too, about going to church -- yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid nobody saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) there. I never
did certainly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The reason of that is.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) said eagerly, <div class="bookquote">'' that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes
in privately by the old tower door, just when the service
commences, and sits at the back of the gallery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
told me so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon
Gabriel ears like the thirteenth stroke of crazy clock.
It was not only received with utter incredulity as re-
garded itself, but threw a doubt on all the assurances
that had preceded it.
Oak was grieved to find how entirely she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brimmed with deep feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) replied in a steady
voice, the steadiness of which was spoilt by the palpable-
ness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) great effort to keep it so: --
<div class="bookquote">``You know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love
you always. I only mention this to bring to your mind
that at any rate I would wish to do you no harm:
beyond that I put it aside. I have lost in the race for
money and good things, and I am not such a fool as to
pretend to `ee now I am poor, and you have got alto-
gether above me. But Bathsheba, dear mistress, this
I beg you to consider -- that, both to keep yourself well
honoured among the workfolk, and in common generosity
to an honourable man who loves you as well as I, you
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
should be more discreet in your bearing towards this
soldier.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) exclaimed, in a choking
voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Are ye not more to me than my own affairs, and
even life!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Come, listen to me! I am
six years older than you, and Mr. Boldwood is ten years
older than I, and consider -- I do beg of `ee to consider
before it is too late -- how safe you would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
hands!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak's allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) lessened, to
some extent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) anger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) interference; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)
could not really forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) for letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wish to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) be eclipsed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wish to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) good, any more
than for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) slighting treatment of Troy.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish you to go elsewhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) commanded, a
paleness of face invisible to the eye being suggested by
the trembling words. <div class="bookquote">``Do not remain on this farm any
longer. I don't want you -- I beg you to go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, calmly. <div class="bookquote">``This is the
second time you have pretended to dismiss me; and
what's the use o' it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretended! You shall go, sir -- your lecturing I
will not hear! I am mistress here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go, indeed -- what folly will you say next? Treating
me like Dick, Tom and Harry when you know that a
short time ago my position was as good as yours! Upon
my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced. You know, too,
that I can't go without putting things in such a strait as
you wouldn't get out of I can't tell when. Unless, indeed,
you'll promise to have an understanding man as bailiff,
or manager, or something. I'll go at once if you'll
promise that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall have no bailiff; I shall continue to be my
own manager.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) said decisively.
``Very well, then; you should be thankful to me for
biding. How would the farm go on with nobody to
mind it but a woman? But mind this, I don't wish
``ee to feel you owe me anything. Not I. What I do,
I do. Sometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to
leave the place -- for don't suppose I'm content to be a
nobody. I was made for better things. However, I
don't like to see your concerns going to ruin, as they
must if you keep in this mind... I hate taking my
own measure so plain, but, upon my life, your provok-
ing ways make a man say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't dream of
at other times! I own to being rather interfering. But
you know well enough how it is, and who she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is that I
like too well, and feel too much like a fool about to be
civil to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!<div class="bookquote">''
It is more than probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) privately and un-
consciously respected him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a little for this grim fidelity,
which had been shown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tone even more than in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) words. At any rate she (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) murmured something to the
effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might stay if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) said more
distinctly, ''  (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div>Will you leave me alone now? I don't
order it as a mistress -- I ask it as a woman, and I
expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse.''
<div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will, Miss Everdene.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, gently.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wondered that the request should have come at this
moment, for the strife was over, and they were on a
most desolate hill, far from every human habitation, and
the hour was getting late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood still and allowed
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to get far ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could only see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
form upon the sky.
A distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) at that point now ensued. A figure apparently rose
from the earth beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The shape beyond all doubt
was Troy's. Oak would not be even a possible listener,
and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards
were between the lovers and himself.
Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard. In
passing the tower he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) thought of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had said about
the sergeant's virtuous habit of entering the church un-
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
perceived at the beginning of service. Believing that
the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which
it stood, and examined it. The pale lustre yet hanging
in the north-western heaven was sufficient to show that
a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across the door
to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the
panel to the stone jamb. It was a decisive proof that
the door had not been opened at least since Troy came
back to Weatherbury.




<p/>CHAPTER XXX



<p/>HOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES


<p/>HALF an hour later Bathsheba entered her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own house.
There burnt upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) met the light of
the candles the flush and excitement which were little
less than chronic with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) now. The farewell words of
Troy, who had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to the very door, still
lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had bidden her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) adieu for two
days, which were so he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stated, to be spent at Bath in
visiting some friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had also kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a second
time.
It is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little
fact which did not come to light till a long time after-
wards: that Troy's presentation of himself so aptly at
the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre-
concerted arrangement. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had hinted -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had
forbidden; and it was only on the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) still
coming that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had dismissed Oak, fearing a meeting
between them just then.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed
by all these new and fevering sequences. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
jumped up with a manner of decision, and fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
desk from a side table.
In three minutes, without pause or modification, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
had written a letter to Boldwood, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) address beyond
Casterbridge, saying mildly but firmly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had well
considered the whole subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had brought before her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
and kindly given her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) time to decide upon; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
final decision was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) could not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
had expressed to Oak an intention to wait till Boldwood
came home before communicating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) conclusive
reply. But Bathsheba found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) could not wait.
It was impossible to send this letter till the next day;
yet to quell her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) uneasiness by getting it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hands,
and so, as it were, setting the act in motion at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
arose to take it to any one of the women who might be
in the kitchen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) paused in the passage. A dialogue was going
on in the kitchen, and Bathsheba and Troy were the
subject of it.
<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll gie up farming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble
between the mirth -- so say I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wish I had half such a husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) servitors said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>); but too much womanly
redundance of speech to leave alone what was said till
it died the natural death of unminded things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
burst in upon them.
<div class="bookquote">``Who are you speaking of?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) asked.
There was a pause before anybody replied. At last
Liddy said frankly,<div class="bookquote">'' What was passing was a bit of a
word about yourself, miss.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought so! Maryann and Liddy and Temper-

froward young person, <div class="bookquote">``HATE him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the froward person</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We know you do, miss.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy; <div class="bookquote">``and so do we

<div class="bookquote">``Maryann -- O you perjured woman! How can you
speak that wicked story!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, excitedly.
<div class="bookquote">``You admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) from your heart only this morning
in the very world, you did. Yes, Maryann, you know it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, miss, but so did you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is a wild scamp
now, and you are right to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).''

I have no right to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), nor you, nor anybody.
But I am a silly woman! What is it to me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is?
You know it is nothing. I don't care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>); I don``t
mean to defend his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) good name, not I. Mind this, if
any of you say a word against him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) you'll be dismissed
instantly!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) flung down the letter and surged back into the
parlour, with a big heart and tearful eyes, Liddy following
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>).
``O miss!'' said mild Liddy, looking pitifully into
Bathsheba's face. ``I am sorry we mistook you so!
did think you cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>); but I see you don't now.''
``Shut the door, Liddy.<div class="bookquote">''
Liddy closed the door, and went on: ''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>People always
say such foolery, miss. I'll make answer hencefor`ard,
<div class="bookquote">``Of course a lady like Miss Everdene can't love him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>);''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'll say it out in plain black and white.''
Bathsheba burst out: ``O Liddy, are you such a
simpleton? Can't you read riddles? Can't you see?
Are you a woman yourself?''
Liddy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.
``Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) said,
in reckless abandonment and grief. ``O, I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
to very distraction and misery and agony! Don't be
frightened at me, though perhaps I am enough to frighten
any innocent woman. Come closer -- closer.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) arms round Liddy's neck. ``I must let it out to
somebody; it is wearing me away! Don't you yet know
enough of me to see through that miserable denial of
mine? O God, what a lie it was! Heaven and my
Love forgive me. And don't you know that a woman
who loves at all thinks nothing of perjury when it is
balanced against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love? There, go out of the room;
I want to be quite alone.''
Liddy went towards the door.
``Liddy, come here. Solemnly swear to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)'s
not a fast man; that it is all lies they say about him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)!''
``Put, miss, how can I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) is not if -- -- ''
``You graceless girl! How can you have the cruel
heart to repeat what they say? Unfeeling thing that
you are... But I<div class="bookquote">``LL see if you or anybody else in the
village, or town either, dare do such a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
started off, pacing from fireplace to door, and back
again.
<div class="bookquote">``No, miss. I don't -- I know it is not true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said
Liddy, frightened at Bathsheba's unwonted vehemence.
I suppose you only agree with me like that to please
me. But, Liddy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) CANNOT BE had, as is said. Do you
hear? ''
``Yes, miss, yes.''
``And you don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) is?''
``I don't know what to say, miss.'' said Liddy, be-
ginning to cry. ``If I say No, you don<div class="bookquote">``t believe me;

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) is not had at all... My poor life and heart,
how weak I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) moaned, in a relaxed, desultory
way, heedless of Liddy's presence. <div class="bookquote">``O, how I wish I
had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)! Loving is misery for women
always. I shall never forgive God for making me a
woman, and dearly am I beginning to pay for the honour
of owning a pretty face.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) freshened and turned to
Liddy suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Mind this, Lydia Smallbury, if you
repeat anywhere a single word of what l have said to
you inside this closed door, I'll never trust you, or love
you, or have you with me a moment longer -- not a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to repeat anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, with
womanly dignity of a diminutive order; <div class="bookquote">``but I don't
wish to stay with you. And, if you please, I'll go at the
end of the harvest, or this week, or to-day... I don't
see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for
nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>concluded the small woman, bigly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no, Liddy; you must stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba,
dropping from haughtiness to entreaty with capricious
inconsequence. <div class="bookquote">``You must not notice my being in a
taking just now. You are not as a servant -- you are a
companion to me. Dear, dear -- I don't know what I
am doing since this miserable ache o'! my heart has
weighted and worn upon me so! What shall I come
to! I suppose I shall get further and further into
troubles. I wonder sometimes if I am doomed to die
in the Union. I am friendless enough, God knows!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't notice anything, nor will I leave you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>sobbed
Liddy, impulsively putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips to Bathsheba's,
and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
Then Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and all was smooth
again.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't often cry, do I, Lidd? but you have made
tears come into my eyes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, a smile shining
through the moisture. <div class="bookquote">``Try to think him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a good man,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will, miss, indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) is a sort of steady man in a wild way, you know.

to keep my secret -- do, Liddy! And do not let them

bringing a few more tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own eyes, not from
any particular necessity, but from an artistic sense of
making herself in keeping with the remainder of the
picture, which seems to influence women at such times.
``I think God likes us to be good friends, don't you?''
``Indeed I do.''
``And, dear miss, you won<div class="bookquote">``t harry me and storm at

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never! do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, slightly laughing,

 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI



<p/>BLAME -- FURY


<p/>THE next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting
out of the way of Mr. Boldwood in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
returning to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) note in person, proceeded to
fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some few hours
earlier. Bathsheba's companion, as a gage of their
reconciliation, had been granted a week's holiday to
visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister, who was married to a thriving hurdler
and cattle-crib-maker living in a delightful labyrinth of
hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury. The arrangement
was that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming
there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con-
trivances which this man of the woods had introduced
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wares.
Leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instructions with Gabriel and Maryann,
that they were to see everything carefully locked up for
the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went out of the house just at the close of
a timely thunder-shower, which had refined the air, and
daintily bathed the coat of the land, though all beneath
was dry as ever. Freshness was exhaled in an essence
from the varied contours of bank and hollow, as if the
earth breathed maiden breath; and the pleased birds
were hymning to the scene. Before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), among the
clouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of
fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour-
hood of a hidden sun, lingering on to the farthest north-
west corner of the heavens that this midsummer season
allowed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had walked nearly two miles of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) journey,
watching how the day was retreating, and thinking how
the time of deeds was quietly melting into the time of
thought, to give place in its turn to the time of prayer
and sleep, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beheld advancing over Yalbury hill
the very man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sought so anxiously to elude. Boldwood
was stepping on, not with that quiet tread of reserved
strength which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) customary gait, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
always seemed to be balancing two thoughts. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
manner was stunned and sluggish now.
Boldwood had for the first time been awakened to
woman's privileges in tergiversation even when it involves
another person's possible blight. That Bathsheba was
a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
fellows, had been the very lung of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hope; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had
held that these qualities would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to adhere to a
straight course for consistency's sake, and accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>),
though her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fancy might not flood him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) with the iridescent
hues of uncritical love. But the argument now came
back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror. The dis-
covery was no less a scourge than a surprise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) came on looking upon the ground, and did not
see Bathsheba till they were less than a stone's throw
apart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) looked up at the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pit-pat, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the
depth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
letter.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) faltered, a guilty
warmth pulsing in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.
Those who have the power of reproaching in silence
may find it a means more effective than words. There
are accents in the eye which are not on the tongue, and
more tales come from pale lips than can enter an ear.
It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter
moods that they avoid the pathway of sound. Bold-
wood's look was unanswerable.
Seeing she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned a little aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What, are
you afraid of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why should you say that?'' said Bathsheba.
``I fancied you looked so.'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). ``And it is most
strange, because of its contrast with my feeling for you.
She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) regained self-possession, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eyes calmly,
and waited.
<div class="bookquote">``You know what that feeling is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>continued Boldwood,
deliberately. <div class="bookquote">``A thing strong as death. No dismissal
by a hasty letter affects that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish you did not feel so strongly about me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It is generous of you, and more than I
deserve, but I must not hear it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hear it? What do you think I have to say, then?
I am not to marry you, and that's enough. Your letter
was excellently plain. I want you to hear nothing --
not I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba was unable to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will into any
definite groove for freeing herself from this fearfully
and was moving on. Boldwood walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heavily
and dully.
<div class="bookquote">``Bathsheba -- darling -- is it final indeed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed it is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Bathsheba -- have pity upon me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood
burst out. <div class="bookquote">``God's sake, yes -- I am come to that low,
lowest stage -- to ask a woman for pity! Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
you -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba commanded herself well. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could
hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips: <div class="bookquote">``There is little honour to the woman in that
speech.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was only whispered, for something unutter-
ably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle
of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a
passion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios.
<div class="bookquote">``I am beyond myself about this, and am mad.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I am no stoic at all to he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) supplicating here; but
I do supplicate to you. I wish you knew what is in
me of devotion to you; but it is impossible, that. In
bare human mercy to a lonely man, don't throw me off
now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't throw you off -- indeed, how can I? I never
had you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) noon-clear sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forgot for a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thoughtless angle
on that day in February.
<div class="bookquote">``But there was a time when you turned to me,
before I thought of you! I don't reproach you, for
even now I feel that the ignorant and cold darkness
that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me
by that letter -- valentine you call it -- would have been
worse than my knowledge of you, though it has brought
this misery. But, I say, there was a time when I knew
nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and yet you
drew me on. And if you say you gave me no en-
couragement, I cannot but contradict you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What you call encouragement was the childish
game of an idle minute. I have bitterly repented of it
-- ay, bitterly, and in tears. Can you still go on re-
minding me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't accuse you of it -- I deplore it. I took for
earnest what you insist was jest, and now this that I
pray to be jest you say is awful, wretched earnest. Our
moods meet at wrong places. I wish your feeling was
more like mine, or my feeling more like yours! O,
could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick
was going to lead me into, how I should have cursed
you; but only having been able to see it since, I cannot
do that, for I love you too well! But it is weak, idle
drivelling to go on like this... Bathsheba, you are
the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever
looked at to love, and it is the having been so near
claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard
to bear. How nearly you promised me! But I don't
speak now to move your heart, and make you grieve
because of my pain; it is no use, that. I must bear it;
my pain would get no less by paining you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I do pity you -- deeply -- O so deeply!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
earnestly said.
<div class="bookquote">``Do no such thing -- do no such thing. Your dear
love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity,
that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great
addition to my sorrow, nor does the gain of your pity
make it sensibly less. O sweet -- how dearly you
spoke to me behind the spear-bed at the washing-pool,
and in the barn at the shearing, and that dearest last
time in the evening at your home! Where are your
pleasant words all gone -- your earnest hope to be able
to love me? Where is your firm conviction that you
would get to care for me very much? Really forgotten?
-- really?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) checked emotion, looked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quietly and clearly
in the face, and said in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) low, firm voice, <div class="bookquote">'' Mr. Bold-
wood, I promised you nothing. Would you have had
me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,
highest compliment a man can pay a woman -- telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? I was bound to show some feeling,
if l would not be a graceless shrew. Yet each of those
pleasures was just for the day -- the day just for the
pleasure. How was I to know that what is a pastime
to all other men was death to you? Have reason, do,
and think more kindly of me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, never mind arguing -- never mind. One
thing is sure: you were all but mine, and now you are
not nearly mine. Everything is changed, and that by
you alone, remember. You were nothing to me once,
and I was contented; you are now nothing to me again,
and how different the second nothing is from the first!
Would to God you had never taken me up, since it was
only to throw me down!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mettle, began to feel un-
mistakable signs that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was inherently the weaker
vessel. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strove miserably against this feminity
which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions
in stronger and stronger current. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had tried to
elude agitation by fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind on the trees, sky, any
trivial object before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) reproaches fell,
but ingenuity could not save her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now.
<div class="bookquote">``I did not take you up -- surely I did not!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
answered as heroically as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">``But don't be in
this mood with me. I can endure being told I am in
the wrong, if you will only tell it me gently! O sir,
will you not kindly forgive me, and look at it
cheerfully?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cheerfully! Can a man fooled to utter heart-
burning find a reason for being merry> If I have lost,
how can I be as if I had won? Heavens you must be
heartless quite! Had I known what a fearfully bitter
sweet this was to be, how would I have avoided you,
and never seen you, and been deaf of you. I tell you
all this, but what do you care! You don't care.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned silent and weak denials to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) charges,
and swayed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head desperately, as if to thrust away
the words as they came showering about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ears from
the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bronzed Roman face and fine frame.
<div class="bookquote">``Dearest, dearest, I am wavering even now between
the two opposites of recklessly renouncing you, and
labouring humbly for you again. Forget that you have
said No, and let it be as it was! Say, Bathsheba, that
you only wrote that refusal to me in fun -- come, say it
to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be untrue, and painful to both of us. You
overrate my capacity for love. I don't possess half
the warmth of nature you believe me to have. An un-
protected childhood in a cold world has beaten gentle-
ness out of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately said with more resentment: <div class="bookquote">``That
may be true, somewhat; but ah, Miss Everdene, it won't
do as a reason! You are not the cold woman you
would have me believe. No, no! It isn't because you
have no feeling in you that you don't love me. You
naturally would have me think so -- you would hide from
that you have a burning heart like mine. You have
love enough, but it is turned into a new channel. I
know where.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The swift music of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart became hubbub now,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throbbed to extremity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was coming to
Troy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did then know what had occurred! And
the name fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips the next moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
asked, fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``When I had no thought of injuring
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), why did he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) force himself upon your notice!
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) worried you your inclination was to have me;
when next I should have come to you your answer
would have been Yes. Can you deny it -- I ask, can
you deny it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delayed the reply, but was to honest to with
hold it.<div class="bookquote">'' I cannot.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``I know you cannot. But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stole in in my absence

would have been set tale-bearing. Now the people
sneer at me -- the very hills and sky seem to laugh at

upon yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``Everybody is

 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't, O, don't pray down evil upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) implored in a miserable cry. <div class="bookquote">``Anything but that --
anything. O, be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), sir, for I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) true .''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood's ideas had reached that point of fusion at
which outline and consistency entirely disappear. The
impending night appeared to concentrate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eye.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all now.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) -- by my soul, that will I! I'll meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), soldier or no, and I'll horsewhip the untimely
stripling for this reckless theft of my one delight. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
were a hundred men I'd horsewhip him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) -- --''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) voice suddenly and unnaturally. <div class="bookquote">``Bath-
sheba, sweet, lost coquette, pardon me! I've been
blaming you, threatening you, behaving like a churl to
you, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'s the greatest sinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) stole your dear
heart away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) unfathomable lies! ... lt is a
fortunate thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'s gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
regiment -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'s away up the country, and not here!
I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) may not return here just yet. I pray God
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may not come into my sight, for I may be tempted
beyond myself. O, Bathsheba, keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away -- yes,
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away from me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>For a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) soul seemed to have been entirely exhaled with
the breath of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) passionate words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) face
away, and withdrew, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) form was soon covered over
by the twilight as his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) footsteps mixed in with the low
hiss of the leafy trees.
Bathsheba, who had been standing motionless as a
model all this latter time, flung her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face,
and wildly attempted to ponder on the exhibition which
had just passed away. Such astounding wells of fevered
feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were incompre-
hensible, dreadful. Instead of being a man trained to
repression he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was -- what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
The force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a
circumstance known at present only to herself: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover was
coming back to Weatherby in the course of the very next
day or two. Troy had not returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) distant barracks as
Boldwood and others supposed, but had merely gone to visit
some acquaintance in Bath, and had yet a week or more
remaining to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) furlough.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) felt wretchedly certain that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) revisited her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) just at
this nick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood,a
fierce quarrel would be the consequence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) panted with
solicitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) thought of possible injury to Troy. The
least spark would kindle the farmer's swift feelings of rage
and jealousy; he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) self-mastery as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had this
evening; Troy's blitheness might become aggressive; it might
take the direction of derision, and Boldwood's anger might
then take the direction of revenge.
With almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing
girl, this guileless woman too well concealed from the world
under a manner of carelessness the warm depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strong
emotions. But now there was no reserve. In fer
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distraction, instead of advancing further she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
walked up and down, beating
the air with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers, pressing on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brow, and sobbing
brokenly to herself. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down on a heap of stones by
the wayside to think. There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) remained long. Above the
dark margin of the earth appeared foreshores and promontor-
ies of coppery cloud,bounding a green and pellucid expanse
in the western sky. Amaranthine glosses came over them then,
and the unresting world wheeled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) round to a contrasting
prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and palpitating
stars. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades of
space, but realised none at all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) troubled spirit was far
away with Troy.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXII



<p/>NIGHT -- HORSES TRAMPING


<p/>THE village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard
in its midst, and the living were lying well nigh as still
as the dead. The church clock struck eleven. The
air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of the
clock-work immediately before the strokes was distinct,
and so was also the click of the same at their close.
The notes flew forth with the usual blind obtuseness
of inanimate things -- flapping and rebounding among
walls, undulating against the scattered clouds, spreading
through their interstices into unexplored miles of space.
Bathsheba's crannied and mouldy halls were to-night
occupied only by Maryann, Liddy being, as was stated,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) sister, whom Bathsheba had set out to visit.
A few minutes after eleven had struck, Maryann turned
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) bed with a sense of being disturbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) was
totally unconscious of the nature of the interruption to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) sleep. It led to a dream, and the dream to an
awakening, with an uneasy sensation that something
had happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) bed and looked out of
the window. The paddock abutted on this end of the
building, and in the paddock she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) could just discern by
the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching the
horse that was feeding there. The figure seized the
horse by the forelock, and led it to the corner of the
field. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) could see some object which circum-
stances proved to be a vehicle for after a few minutes
the horse down the road, mingled with the sound of
light wheels.
Two varieties only of humanity could have entered
the paddock with the ghostlike glide of that mysterious
figure. They were a woman and a gipsy man. A woman
was out of the question in such an occupation at this
hour, and the comer could be no less than a thief, who
might probably have known the weakness of the house-
hold on this particular night, and have chosen it on
that account for his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) daring attempt. Moreover, to
raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies in!
Weatherbury Bottom.
Maryann, who had been afraid to shout in the robber's
presence, having seen him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) depart had no fear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
hastily slipped on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) clothes, stumped down the dis-
jointed staircase with its hundred creaks, ran to Coggan's,
the nearest house, and raised an alarm. Coggan called
Gabriel, who now again lodged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) house as at first,
and together they went to the paddock. Beyond all
doubt the horse was gone.
<div class="bookquote">``Hark!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
They listened. Distinct upon the stagnant air came
the sounds of a trotting horse passing up Longpuddle
Lane -- just beyond the gipsies' encampment in Weather-
bury Bottom.
<div class="bookquote">``That's our Dainty-i'll swear to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) step.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Jan.
<div class="bookquote">``Mighty me! Won't mis`ess storm and call us stupids
wen she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) comes back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Maryann/Maryann Money</b></font>)</div>moaned Maryann. <div class="bookquote">``How I
wish it had happened when she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was at home, and none
of us had been answerable!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We must ride after.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, decisively.
be responsible to Miss Everdene for what we do. Yes,
we'll follow. ''
``Faith, I don't see how.'' said Coggan. ``All our
horses are too heavy for that trick except little Poppet,
and what's she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) between two of us?-if we only had that
pair over the hedge we might do something.''
``Which pair?''
``Mr Boldwood's Tidy and Moll.''
``Then wait here till I come hither again.'' said Gabriel.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ran down the hill towards Farmer Boldwood's.
``Farmer Boldwood is not at home.'' said Maryann.
``All the better.'' said Coggan. ``I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'s
gone for.''
Less than five minutes brought up Oak again, running
at the same pace, with two halters dangling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) hand.
``Where did you find 'em?'' said Coggan, turning
round and leaping upon the hedge without waiting for
an answer.
``Under the eaves. I knew where they were kept,''
said Gabriel, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). ``Coggan, you can ride
bare-backed? there's no time to look for saddles.''
``Like a hero!'' said Jan.
``Maryann, you go to hed.'' Gabriel shouted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>)
from the top of the hedge.
Springing down into Boldwood's pastures, each
pocketed his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) halter to hide it from the horses, who,
seeing the men empty-handed, docilely allowed them-
selves to he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) seized by the mane, when the halters
were dexterously slipped on. Having neither bit nor
bridle, Oak and Coggan extemporized the former by
passing the rope in each case through the animal's
mouth and looping it on the other side. Oak vaulted
astride, and Coggan clambered up by aid of the hank,
when they ascended to the gate and galloped off in the
direction taken by Bathsheha's horse and the robber.
Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to was a
matter of some uncertainty.
Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four
minutes. They scanned the shady green patch by the
roadside. The gipsies were gone.
``The villains!'' said Gabriel. ``Which way have they
gone, I wonder?''
``Straight on, as sure as God made little apples,''
said Jan.
``Very well; we are better mounted, and must over-
discovered. The road-metal grew softer and more
rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but
not muddy state. They came to cross-roads. Coggan
suddenly pulled up Moll and slipped off.
<div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``We must try to track 'em, since we can't hear 'em,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Jan, fumbling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) struck a light,
and held the match to the ground. The rain had been
heavier here, and all foot and horse tracks made previous
to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops,
and they were now so many little scoops of water, which
reflected the flame of the match like eyes. One set of
tracks was fresh and had no water in them; one pair of
ruts was also empty, and not small canals, like the others.
The footprints forming this recent impression were full
of information as to pace; they were in equidistant pairs,
three or four feet apart, the right and left foot of each
pair being exactly opposite one another.
<div class="bookquote">``Straight on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>Jan exclaimed. ``Tracks like that
mean a stiff gallop. No wonder we don't hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>).
And the horse is harnessed -- look at the ruts. Ay,
``How do you know?''
``Old Jimmy Harris only shoed her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) last week, and
I'd swear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) make among ten thousand.''
``The rest of the gipsies must ha<div class="bookquote">'' gone on earlier,
or some other way.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gipsies</b></font>)</div>said Oak. <div class="bookquote">``You saw there were
no other tracks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They rode along silently for a long weary
time. Coggan carried an old pinchbeck repeater which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) had inherited from some genius in his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) family; and
it now struck one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) lighted another match, and ex-
amined the ground again.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis a canter now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said, throwing away the light.
<div class="bookquote">``A twisty, rickety pace for a gig. The fact is, they over-
drove her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) at starting, we shall catch 'em yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Blackmore</b></font>)</div>Again they hastened on, and entered Blackmore
Vale. Coggan's watch struck one. When they looked
again the hoof-marks were so spaced as to form a sort
of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.
<div class="bookquote">``That's a trot, I know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Only a trot now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``We
shall overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) in time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah! a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Jan. ``Let's see how she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was
driven up this hill. ``Twill help us.'' A light was
promptly struck upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) gaiters as before, and the ex-
amination made,
``Hurrah!'' said Coggan. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) walked up here --
and well she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) might. We shall get them in two miles,
for a crown.''
They rode three, and listened. No sound was to be
heard save a millpond trickling hoarsely through a
hatch, and suggesting gloomy possibilities of drowning
by jumping in. Gabriel dismounted when they came
to a turning. The tracks were absolutely the only guide
as to the direction that they now had, and great caution
was necessary to avoid confusing them with some others
which had made their appearance lately.
``What does this mean? -- though I guess.'' said
Gabriel, looking up at Coggan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) moved the match
over the ground about the turning. Coggan, who, no
less than the panting horses, had latterly shown signs
of weariness, again scrutinized the mystic characters.
This time only three were of the regular horseshoe
shape. Every fourth was a dot.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) face and emitted a long
``Whew-w-w!''
``Lame.'' said Oak.
``Yes Dainty is lamed; the near-foot-afore.'' said
Coggan slowly staring still at the footprints.
``We'll push on.'' said Gabriel, remounting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) humid
steed.
Although the road along its greater part had been as
good as any turnpike-road in the country, it was nomin-
ally only a byway. The last turning had brought them
into the high road leading to Bath. Coggan recollected
himself.
``We shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) now!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) exclaimed.
``Where?''
``Sherton Turnpike. The keeper of that gate is the
sleepiest man between here and London -- Dan Randall.
that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Randall</b></font>) name -- knowed en for years, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Randall</b></font>) was at
Casterbridge gate. Between the lameness and the gate
`tis a done job.''
``Twas said until, against a shady background of foliage,
five white bars were visible, crossing their route a little
way ahead.
<div class="bookquote">``Hush -- we are almost close!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Amble on upon the grass.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a
dark shape in front of them. The silence of this lonely
time was pierced by an exclamation from that quarter.
<div class="bookquote">``Hoy-a-hoy! Gate!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the keeper</b></font>)</div>It appeared that there had been a previous call which
they had not noticed, for on their close approach the
door of the turnpike-house opened, and the keeper
came out half-dressed, with a candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand. The
rays illumined the whole group.
<div class="bookquote">``Keep the gate close!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>shouted Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Randall</b></font>) has
stolen the horse!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Who?'' said the turnpike-man.
Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a
woman -- Bathsheba, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mistress.
On hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face away
from the light. Coggan had, however, caught sight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in the meanwhile.
``Why, `tis mistress-i'll take my oath!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said,
amazed.
Bathsheba it certainly was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had by this time
done the trick she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could do so well in crises not of love,
namely, mask a surprise by coolness of manner.
``Well, Gabriel.<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) inquired quietly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>where are you
going?''
``We thought -- --'' began Gabriel.
``Bath.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, taking for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) own
use the assurance that Gabriel lacked. ``An important
matter made it necessary for me to give up my visit to
liddy, and go off at once. What, then, were you
following me?''
``We thought the horse was stole.''
``Well-what a thing! How very foolish of you not
to know that I had taken the trap and horse. I could
neither wake Maryann nor get into the house, though
I hammered for ten minutes against her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) window-sill.
Fortunately, I could get the key of the coach-house, so
I troubled no one further. Didn't you think it might
be me?''
``Why should we, miss?''
``Perhaps not Why, those are never Farmer Bold-
wood's horses! Goodness mercy! what have you been
doing bringing trouble upon me in this way? What!
mustn't a lady move an inch from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) door without being
dogged like a thief?''
``But how was we to know, if you left no account of
your doings?'' expostulated Coggan, ``and ladies don't
drive at these hours, miss, as a jineral rule of society.''
``I did leave an account -- and you would have seen
it in the morning. I wrote in chalk on the coach-house
doors that I had come back for the horse and gig, and
driven off; that I could arouse nobody, and should
return soon.''
``But you'll consider, ma'am, that we couldn't see
that till it got daylight.''
``True.<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, and though vexed at first she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had
too much sense to blame them long or seriously for a
devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) that was as valuable as it was rare.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) added with a very pretty grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well, I really thank
you heartily for taking all this trouble; but I wish you
had borrowed anybody's horses but Mr. Boldwood's.''
``Dainty is lame, miss.'' said Coggan. ``Can ye go
on?''
``lt was only a stone in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) shoe. I got down and
pulled it out a hundred yards back. I can manage
very well, thank you. I shall be in Bath by daylight.
Will you now return, please?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head -- the gateman's candle
shimmering upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) quick, clear eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) did so --
passed through the gate, and was soon wrapped in the
embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs.
Coggan and Gabriel put about their horses, and, fanned
by the velvety air of this July night, retraced the road
by which they had come.
``A strange vagary, this of hers, isn't it, Oak?'' said
Coggan, curiously.
``Yes.'' said Gabriel, shortly.
``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) won't be in Bath by no daylight!''
``Coggan, suppose we keep this night's work as quiet
as we can?''
``I am of one and the same mind.''
<div class="bookquote">``Very well. We shall be home by three o'clock or
so, and can creep into the parish like lambs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside
had ultimately evolved a conclusion that there were only
two remedies for the present desperate state of affairs.
The first was merely to keep Troy away from Weather-
bury till Boldwood's indignation had cooled; the second
to listen to Oak's entreaties, and Boldwood's denuncia-
tions, and give up Troy altogether.
Alas! Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) give up this new love -- induce
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) to renounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) by saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) --
could no more speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) good,
to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) furlough in Bath, and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) and Weather-
bury no more?
It was a picture full of misery, but for a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
contemplated it firmly, allowing herself, nevertheless,
as girls will, to dwell upon the happy life she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) would
have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood, and the path
of love the path of duty -- inflicting upon herself gratuit-
ous tortures by imagining him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) the lover of another
woman after forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had penetrated
Troy's nature so far as to estimate his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) tendencies pretty
accurately, hut unfortunately loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) no less in
thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) might soon cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) -- indeed,
considerably more.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) jumped to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) feet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) would see him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) at once.
Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) would implore him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) by word of mouth to assist
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) in this dilemma. A letter to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) away could
not reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) in time, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) should be disposed to
listen to it.
Was Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact
that the support of a lover's arms is not of a kind best
calculated to assist a resolve to renounce him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)? Or was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) sophistically sensible, with a thrill of pleasure, that
by adopting this course for getting rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was
ensuring a meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), at any rate, once more?
It was now dark, and the hour must have been nearly
ten. The only way to accomplish her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) purpose was to
give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) idea of visiting Liddy at Yalbury, return to
Weatherbury Farm, put the horse into the gig, and drive
at once to Bath. The scheme seemed at first impossible:
the journey was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong
horse, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) own estimate; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) much underrated
the distance. It was most venturesome for a woman,
at night, and alone.
But could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go on to Liddy's and leave things to
take their course? No, no; anything but that. Bath-
sheba was full of a stimulating turbulence, beside which
caution vainly prayed for a hearing. she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned back
towards the village.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walk was slow, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished not to enter
Weatherbury till the cottagers were in bed, and, par-
ticularly, till Boldwood was secure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plan was now
to drive to Bath during the night, see Sergeant Troy in
the morning before he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) set out to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>)
farewell, and dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>): then to rest the horse
thoroughly -LRB-herself to weep the while, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought-RRB-,
starting early the next morning on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) return journey.
By this arrangement she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could trot Dainty gently all
the day, reach Liddy at Yalbury in the evening, and
come home to Weatherbury with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whenever they
chose -- so nobody would know she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been to Bath
at all.
Such was Bathsheba's scheme. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) topo-
graphical ignorance as a late comer to the place, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
misreckoned the distance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) journey as not much
more than half what it really was. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idea, however,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proceeded to carry out, with what initial success we
have already seen.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII



<p/>IN THE SUN -- A HARBINGER


<p/>A WEEK passed, and there were no tidings of Bath-
sheba; nor was there any explanation of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Gilpin's
rig.
Then a note came for Maryann, stating that the
business which had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) mistress to Bath still
detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) there; but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) hoped to return
in the course of another week.
Another week passed. The oat-harvest began, and
all the men were a-field under a monochromatic Lammas
sky, amid the trembling air and short shadows of noon.
Indoors nothing was to be heard save the droning of
blue-bottle flies; out-of-doors the whetting of scythes
and the hiss of tressy oat-ears rubbing together as their
perpendicular stalks of amber-yellow fell heavily to each
swath. Every drop of moisture not in the men's bottles
and flagons in the form of cider was raining as perspira-
tion from their foreheads and cheeks. Drought was
everywhere else.
They were about to withdraw for a while into the
charitable shade of a tree in the fence, when Coggan
saw a figure in a blue coat and brass buttons running
to them across the field.
<div class="bookquote">``I wonder who that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope nothing is wrong about mistress.''  (<font color='red'><b>Maryann/Maryann Money</b></font>)</div>said
Maryann, who with some other women was tying the
bundles -LRB-oats being always sheafed on this farm-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``but
an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning.
l went to unlock the door and dropped the key, and it
fell upon the stone floor and broke into two pieces.
Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement. I wish mis`ess
was home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>some women</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis Cain Ball.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, pausing from whetting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) reaphook.
Oak was not bound by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) agreement to assist in the
corn-field; but the harvest month is an anxious time for
a farmer, and the corn was Bathsheba's, so he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lent a
hand.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s dressed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) best clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Matthew
Moon. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hev been away from home for a few days,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s had that felon upon his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) finger; for 'a said,
since I can't work I'll have a hollerday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A good time for one -- a excellent time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph
Poorgrass, straightening his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) back; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>), like some of
the others, had a way of resting a while from his (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) labour
on such hot days for reasons preternaturally small; of
which Cain Pall's advent on a week-day in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) Sunday-
clothes was one of the first magnitude. <div class="bookquote">``Twas a bad leg
allowed me to read the Pilgrim's Progress, and Mark
Clark learnt AliFours in a whitlow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, and my father put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm out of joint to have
time to go courting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing
tone, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) shirt-sleeve and thrusting
back his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) hat upon the nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) neck.
By this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters,
and was perceived to be carrying a large slice of bread
and ham in one hand, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) took mouthfuls
as he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) ran, the other being wrapped in a bandage.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) came close, his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) mouth assumed the bell shape,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) began to cough violently.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, Cainy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, sternly. <div class="bookquote">``How many
more times must I tell you to keep from running so fast
when you be eating? You'll choke yourself some day,
that's what you'll do, Cain Ball.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hok-hok-hok!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>replied Cain. <div class="bookquote">``A crumb of my
victuals went the wrong way -- hok-hok!, That's what
`tis, Mister Oak! And I've been visiting to Bath
because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and l've
seen -- ahok-hok!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>Directly Cain mentioned Bath, they all threw down
their hooks and forks and drew round him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>). Un-
fortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>)
narrative powers, and a supplementary hindrance was
that of a sneeze, jerking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) pocket his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) rather large
watch, which dangled in front of the young man
pendulum-wise.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) continued, directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) thoughts to Bath
and letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) eyes follow, <div class="bookquote">``l've seed the world at last
-- yes -- and I've seed our mis`ess -- ahok-hok-hok!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bother the boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.<div class="bookquote">'' Something is
always going the wrong way down your throat, so that
you can't tell what's necessary to be told.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ahok! there! Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have
just fleed into my stomach and brought the cough on
again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's just it. Your mouth is always open, you
young rascal!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat,
pore boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Matthew Moon.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, at Bath you saw -- --''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>prompted Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``I saw our mistress.''  (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd</b></font>)</div>continued the junior shepherd,
<div class="bookquote">``and a sojer, walking along. And bymeby they got
closer and closer, and then they went arm-in-crook, like
courting complete -- hok-hok! like courting complete --
hok! -- courting complete -- -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>the shepherd</b></font>)</div>Losing the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
narrative at this point simultaneously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) loss of
breath, their informant looked up and down the field
apparently for some clue to it. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I see our mis`ess
and a soldier -- a-ha-a-wk!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Damn the boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis only my manner, Mister Oak, if ye'll excuse it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Cain Ball, looking reproachfully at Oak, with eyes
drenched in their own dew.
!Here's some cider for him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) -- that'll cure his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) throat,''
said Jan Coggan, lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out
the cork, and applying the hole to Cainy's mouth;
Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think
apprehensively of the serious consequences that would
follow Cainy Ball's strangulation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) cough, and the
history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) Bath adventures dying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>).
``For my poor self, I always say <div class="bookquote">``please God''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>afore
I do anything.'' said Joseph, in an unboastful voice; ``and
so should you, Cain Ball. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis a great safeguard, and
might perhaps save you from being choked to death
some day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>Mr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liber-
ality at the suffering Cain's circular mouth; half of it
running down the side of the flagon, and half of what
reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) mouth running down outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) throat,
and half of what ran in going the wrong way, and being
coughed and sneezed around the persons of the gathered
reapers in the form of a cider fog, which for a moment
hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation.
<div class="bookquote">``There's a great clumsy sneeze! Why can't ye have
better manners, you young dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, with-
drawing the flagon.
<div class="bookquote">``The cider went up my nose!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cainy/Cainy Ball</b></font>)</div>cried Cainy, as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) could speak; <div class="bookquote">``and now `tis gone down my neck,
and into my poor dumb felon, and over my shiny
buttons and all my best cloze!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The poor lad's cough is terrible unfortunate.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said
Matthew Moon. <div class="bookquote">``And a great history on hand, too.
Bump his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) back, shepherd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis my nater.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>mourned Cain. <div class="bookquote">``Mother says I
always was so excitable when my feelings were worked
up to a point!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True, true.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph Poorgrass. ``The Balls
were always a very excitable family. I knowed the
boy's grandfather -- a truly nervous and modest man,
even to genteel refinery. ``Twas blush, blush with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
almost as much as `tis with me -- not but that `tis a
fault in me!''
``Not at all, Master Poorgrass.<div class="bookquote">'' said Coggan. '' (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>`Tis
a very noble quality in ye.''
``Heh-heh! well, I wish to noise nothing abroad --
nothing at all.'' murmured Poorgrass, diffidently. ``But
we be born to things -- that's true. Yet I would rather
my trifle were hid; though, perhaps, a high nater is a
little high, and at my birth all things were possible to
my Maker, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) may have begrudged no gifts...
But under your bushel, Joseph! under your bushel with
<div class="bookquote">``ee! A strange desire, neighbours, this desire to hide,
and no praise due. Yet there is a Sermon on the
Mount with a calendar of the blessed at the head, and
certain meek men may be named therein.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cainy's grandfather was a very clever man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said
Matthew Moon. <div class="bookquote">``Invented a' apple-tree out of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) own
head, which is called by his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) name to this day -- the Early
Ball. You know 'em, Jan? A Quarrenden grafted on
a Tom Putt, and a Rathe-ripe upon top o' that again.
'' (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>`Tis trew 'a used to bide about in a public-house wi' a
woman in a way he (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>) had no business to by rights, but
there -- 'a were a clever man in the sense of the term.''
``Now then.<div class="bookquote">'' said Gabriel, impatiently, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>what did you
see, Cain?''
``I seed our mis`ess go into a sort of a park place,
where there's seats, and shrubs and flowers, arm-in-crook
with a sojer.'' continued Cainy, firmly, and with a dim
sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) words were very effective as regarded
Gabriel's emotions. ``And I think the sojer was
Sergeant Troy. And they sat there together for more
than half-an-hour, talking moving things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) once
was crying a`most to death. And when they came out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) eyes were shining and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) was as white as a lily;
and they looked into one another's faces, as far-gone
friendly as a man and woman can be.''
Gabriel's features seemed to get thinner. ``Well,
what did you see besides?''
``Oh, all sorts.''
``White as a lily? You are sure 'twas she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what besides?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Great glass windows to the shops, and great clouds
in the sky, full of rain, and old wooden trees in the
country round.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You stun-poll! What will ye say next?''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said
Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``Let en alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>interposed Joseph Poorgrass. ``The
boy's meaning is that the sky and the earth in the
kingdom of Bath is not altogether different from ours
here. ``Tis for our good to gain knowledge of strange
cities, and as such the boy's words should be suffered,
so to speak it.''
``And the people of Bath.'' continued Cain, ``never
need to light their fires except as a luxury, for the
water springs up out of the earth ready boiled for
use.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`Tis true as the light.<div class="bookquote">'' testified Matthew Moon.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I've
heard other navigators say the same thing.''
``They drink nothing else there.<div class="bookquote">'' said Cain,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and seem
to enjoy it, to see how they swaller it down.''
``Well, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us,
but I daresay the natives think nothing o' it.'' said
Matthew.
``And don't victuals spring up as well as drink?''
asked Coggan, twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) eye.
``No-i own to a blot there in Bath -- a true blot.
God didn't provide 'em with victuals as well as -LRB--
and 'twas a drawback I couldn't get over at all.''
``Well, `tis a curious place, to say the least.'' observed
Moon; ``and it must be a curious people that live
therein. ''
``Miss Everdene and the soldier were walking about
together, you say?'' said Gabriel, returning to the
group.
``Ay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) wore a beautiful gold-colour silk
gown, trimmed with black lace, that would have stood
alone `ithout legs inside if required. <div class="bookquote">``Twas a very
winsome sight; and her (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) hair was brushed splendid.
And when the sun shone upon the bright gown and his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>)
red coat -- my! how handsome they looked. You
could see 'em all the length of the street.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>murmured Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``And then I went into Griffin's to hae my boots
hobbed, and then I went to Riggs's batty-cake shop,
and asked 'em for a penneth of the cheapest and nicest
stales, that were all but blue-mouldy, but not quite.
And whilst I was chawing 'em down I walked on and
seed a clock with a face as big as a baking trendle -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's nothing to do with mistress!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm coming to that, if you'll leave me alone, Mister
Oak!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated Cainy. <div class="bookquote">``If you excites me,
perhaps you'll bring on my cough, and then I shan't be
able to tell ye nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes-let him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) tell it his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
Gabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience,
and Cainy went on: --
<div class="bookquote">``And there were great large houses, and more
people all the week long than at Weatherbury club-
walking on White Tuesdays. And I went to grand
churches and chapels. And how the parson would pray!
Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) would kneel down and put up his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) hands
together, and make the holy gold rings on his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) fingers
gleam and twinkle in yer eyes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>)'d earned
by praying so excellent well! -- Ah yes, I wish I lived
there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cainy/Cainy Ball</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Our poor Parson Thirdly can't get no money to
buy such rings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Matthew Moon, thoughtfully.
<div class="bookquote">``And as good a man as ever walked. I don't believe
poor Thirdly have a single one, even of humblest tin or
copper. Such a great ornament as they'd be to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on
a dull afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s up in the pulpit lighted by
the wax candles! But `tis impossible, poor man. Ah,
to think how unequal things be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s made of different stuff than to wear
``em.<div class="bookquote">'' said Gabriel, grimly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Well, that's enough of this.
Go on, Cainy -- quick.''
``Oh -- and the new style of parsons wear moustaches
and long beards.'' continued the illustrious traveller,
``and look like Moses and Aaron complete, and make
we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the
children of Israel.''
``A very right feeling -- very.'' said Joseph Poorgrass.
``And there's two religions going on in the nation
now -- High Church and High Chapel. And, thinks I,
I'll play fair; so I went to High Church in the morning,
and High Chapel in the afternoon.''
``A right and proper boy.'' said Joseph Poorgrass.
``Well, at High Church they pray singing, and worship
all the colours of the rainbow; and at High Chapel they
pray preaching, and worship drab and whitewash only.
And then-i didn't see no more of Miss Everdene at
all.''
``Why didn't you say so afore, then?'' exclaimed Oak,
with much disappointment.
``Ah.<div class="bookquote">'' said Matthew Moon, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'ll wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cake
dough if so be she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s over intimate with that man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s not over intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel,
indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would know better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan. <div class="bookquote">``Our
mis`ess has too much sense under they knots of black
hair to do such a mad thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s not a coarse, ignorant man, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
was well brought up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Matthew, dubiously. <div class="bookquote">'''Twas
only wildness that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) a soldier, and maids rather
like your man of sin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, Cain Ball.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel restlessly, <div class="bookquote">``can you
swear in the most awful form that the woman you saw
was Miss Everdene?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph in the sepulchral tone the circumstances
demanded, ``and you know what taking an oath is.
``Tis a horrible testament mind ye, which you say and
seal with your blood-stone, and the prophet Matthew
tells us that on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) to powder. Now, before all the work-folk here
assembled, can you swear to your words as the shep-
herd asks ye?''
``Please no, Mister Oak!'' said Cainy, looking from
one to the other with great uneasiness at the spiritual
magnitude of the position. ``I don't mind saying `tis
true, but I don't like to say `tis damn true, if that's
what you mane.''
``Cain, Cain, how can you!'' asked Joseph sternly.
``You be asked to swear in a holy manner, and you
swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera, who cursed
as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) came. Young man, fie!''
``No, I don't! <div class="bookquote">``Tis you want to squander a pore
boy's soul, Joseph Poorgrass -- that's what `tis!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cain/Cain Ball</b></font>)</div>said
Cain, beginning to cry. <div class="bookquote">``All I mane is that in common
truth 'twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy, but in
the horrible so-help-me truth that ye want to make of
it perhaps 'twas somebody else!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There's no getting at the rights of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel,
turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) work.
<div class="bookquote">``Cain Ball, you'll come to a bit of bread!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>groaned
Joseph Poorgrass.
Then the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and
the old sounds went on. Gabriel, without making any
pretence of being lively, did nothing to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
was particularly dull. However, Coggan knew pretty
nearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook
together he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said --
<div class="bookquote">``Don't take on about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Gabriel. What difference
does it make whose sweetheart she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) is, since she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) can't be
yours?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's the very thing I say to myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV



<p/>HOME AGAIN -- A TRICKSTER


<p/>THAT same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over
Coggan's garden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey
before retiring to rest.
A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along
the grassy margin of the lane. From it spread the
tones of two women talking. The tones were natural
and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the
voices to he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) those of Bathsheba and Liddy.
The carriage came opposite and passed by. It was
Miss Everdene's gig, and Liddy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) mistress were
the only occupants of the seat. Liddy was asking
questions about the city of Bath, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) companion
was answering them listlessly and unconcernedly. Both
Bathsheba and the horse seemed weary.
The exquisite relief of finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) was here
again, safe and sound, overpowered all reflection, and
Oak could only luxuriate in the sense of it. All grave
reports were forgotten.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) lingered and lingered on, till there was no
difference between the eastern and western expanses
of sky, and the timid hares began to limp courageously
round the dim hillocks. Gabriel might have been
there an additional half-hour when a dark form walked
slowly by. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Gabriel.''  (<font color='red'><b>the passer</b></font>)</div>the passer said.
It was Boldwood. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
Boldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak
shortly afterwards turned indoors to bed.
Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene's
house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) reached the front, and approaching the
entrance, saw a light in the parlour. The blind was
not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba,
looking over some papers or letters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>passer</b></font>) back was
towards Boldwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) went to the door, knocked,
and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow.
Boldwood had not been outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) garden since
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) meeting with Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury.
Silent and alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had remained in moody medita-
tion on woman's ways, deeming as essentials of the
whole sex the accidents of the single one of their
number he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had ever closely beheld. By degrees a
more charitable temper had pervaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and this
was the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sally to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had come to
apologize and beg forgiveness of Bathsheba with some-
thing like a sense of shame at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) violence, having but
just now learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had returned -- only from a
visit to Liddy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) supposed, the Bath escapade
being quite unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) inquired for Miss Everdene. Liddy's manner
was odd, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) did not notice it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went in, leaving
him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) standing there, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) absence the blind of the
room containing Bathsheba was pulled down. Bold-
wood augured ill from that sign. Liddy came out.
<div class="bookquote">``My mistress cannot see you, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
The farmer instantly went out by the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
as unforgiven -- that was the issue of it all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) simultaneously a delight and
a torture, sitting in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) had shared with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in
he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) summer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had denied him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) an entrance
there now.
Boldwood did not hurry homeward. It was ten
o'clock at least, when, walking deliberately through the
lower part of Weatherbury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heard the carrier's spring
van entering the village. The van ran to and from a
town in a northern direction, and it was owned and
driven by a Weatherbury man, at the door of whose
house it now pulled up. The lamp fixed to the head
of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form, who
was the first to alight.
<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood to himself, <div class="bookquote">``come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Troy entered the carrier's house, which had been
the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lodging on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) last visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) native
place. Boldwood was moved by a sudden determina-
tion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hastened home. In ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was
back again, and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) were going to call upon
Troy at the carrier's. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) approached, some
one opened the door and came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heard this
person say <div class="bookquote">'' Good-night''  (<font color='red'><b>this person</b></font>)</div>to the inmates, and the voice
was Troy's. ``This was strange, coming so immediately
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arrival. Boldwood, however, hastened up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). Troy had what appeared to be a carpet-bag
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand -- the same that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) were going to leave again this very
night.
Troy turned up the hill and quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) pace.
Boldwood stepped forward.
``Sergeant Troy?''
``Yes-i'm Sergeant Troy.''
``Just arrived from up the country, I think?<div class="bookquote">``Just arrived from Bath.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am William Boldwood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>The tone in which this word was uttered was all
that had been wanted to bring Boldwood to the
point.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish to speak a word with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``What about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) who lives just ahead there -- and about
a woman you have wronged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder at your impertinence.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, moving
on.
<div class="bookquote">``Now look here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, standing in front
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">'' wonder or not, you are going to hold a conver-
sation with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
voice, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) stalwart frame, then at the thick
cudgel he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) remembered it was
past ten o'clock. It seemed worth while to be civil to
Boldwood.
<div class="bookquote">``Very well, I'll listen with pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy,
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) bag on the ground, <div class="bookquote">``only speak low, for
somebody or other may overhear us in the farmhouse
there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well then -- I know a good deal concerning your
Fanny Robin's attachment to you. I may say, too, that
I believe I am the only person in the village, excepting
Gabriel Oak, who does know it. You ought to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I ought. Indeed, l wish to, but I
cannot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div>Troy was about to utter something hastily; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) then
checked himself and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am too poor.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) voice
was changed. Previously it had had a devil-may-care
tone. It was the voice of a trickster now.
Boldwood's present mood was not critical enough to
notice tones. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I may as well speak
plainly; and understand, I don't wish to enter into the
questions of right or wrong, woman's honour and shame,
or to express any opinion on your conduct. I intend a
business transaction with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we sit down here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>An old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately
opposite, and they sat down.
The tone in which this word was uttered was all
Troy heard the dull determination in Boldwood's
voice, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) stalwart frame, then at the thick

<div class="bookquote">``I was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, <div class="bookquote">``but you came and -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not engaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Troy.
<div class="bookquote">``As good as engaged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If I had not turned up she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have become en-

``If you had not come I should certainly -- yes,
certainly -- have been accepted by this time. If you had
not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) you might have been married to Fanny.
Well, there's too much difference between Miss Ever-
dene's station and your own for this flirtation with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
ever to benefit you by ending in marriage. So all I ask
is, don't molest her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) any more. Marry Fanny.
make it worth your while.''
``How will you?''
``I'll pay you well now, I'll settle a sum of money
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and I'll see that you don't suffer from poverty
in the future. I'll put it clearly. Bathsheba is only
playing with you: you are too poor for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as I said;
so give up wasting your time about a great match you'll
never make for a moderate and rightful match you may
make to-morrow; take up your carpet-bag, turn about,
leave Weatherbury now, this night, and you shall take
fifty pounds with you. Fanny shall have fifty to enable
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to prepare for the wedding, when you have told me
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is living, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shall have five hundred
paid down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wedding-day.''
In making this statement Boldwood's voice revealed
only too clearly a consciousness of the weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) aims, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) method. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) manner had
lapsed quite from that of the firm and dignified Bold-
wood of former times; and such a scheme as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had
now engaged in he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would have condemned as childishly
imbecile only a few months ago. We discern a grand
force in the lover which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lacks whilst a free man; but
there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in
the lover we vainly seek. Where there is much bias
there must be some narrowness, and love, though added
emotion, is subtracted capacity. Boldwood exemplified
this to an abnormal degree: he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) knew nothing of Fanny
Robin's circumstances or whereabouts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) knew nothing
of Troy's possibilities, yet that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said.
``I like Fanny best.'' said Troy; ``and if, as you say,
Miss Everdene is out of my reach, why I have all to
gain by accepting your money, and marrying Fan. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)'s only a servant.''
``Never mind -- do you agree to my arrangement?''
``I do.''
``Ah!'' said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice. ``O,
Troy, if you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best, why then did you step in here
and injure my happiness?''
``I love Fanny best now.'' said Troy. ``But
Bathsh -- -- Miss Everdene inflamed me, and displaced
Fanny for a time. It is over now.''
``Why should it be over so soon? And why then
did you come here again?''
``There are weighty reasons. Fifty pounds at once,
you said!''
``I did.<div class="bookquote">'' said Boldwood, ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and here they are -- fifty
sovereigns.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) handed Troy a small packet.
``You have everything ready -- it seems that you
calculated on my accepting them.'' said the sergeant,
taking the packet.
``I thought you might accept them.'' said Boldwood.
``You've only my word that the programme shall be
adhered to, whilst I at any rate have fifty pounds.''
``l had thought of that, and l have considered that
if I can't appeal to your honour I can trust to your --
well, shrewdness we'll call it -- not to lose five hundred
pounds in prospect, and also make a bitter enemy of a
man who is willing to be an extremely useful friend.''
``Stop, listen!'' said Troy in a whisper.
A light pit-pat was audible upon the road just above
them.
``By George -- `tis she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) continued. ``I must go
on and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) -- who?''
``Bathsheba.''
``Bathsheba -- out alone at this time o' night!<div class="bookquote">'' said
Boldwood in amazement, and starting up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>Why must
you meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)?''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was expecting me to-night -- and I must now
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and wish her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) good-bye, according to your
wish. ''
``I don't see the necessity of speaking.''
``It can do no harm -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll be wandering about
looking for me if I don't. You shall hear all I say to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
It will help you in your love-making when I am gone.''
``Your tone is mocking.''
``O no. And remember this, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does not know
what has become of me, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will think more about me
than if I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) flatly I have come to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up.''
``Will you confine your words to that one point? --
Shall I hear every word you say?''
``Every word. Now sit still there, and hold my<div class="bookquote">''
carpet bag for me, and mark what you hear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the walker</b></font>)</div>The light footstep came closer, halting occasionally,
as if the walker listened for a sound. Troy whistled a
double note in a soft, fluty tone.
<div class="bookquote">``Come to that, is it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>murmured Boldwood, uneasily.
<div class="bookquote">``You promised silence.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy.
<div class="bookquote">``I promise again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy stepped forward.
<div class="bookquote">``Frank, dearest, is that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>The tones were
Bathsheba's.
<div class="bookquote">``O God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Troy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``How late you are.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) continued, tenderly. <div class="bookquote">``Did
you come by the carrier? I listened and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
wheels entering the village, but it was some time ago,
and I had almost given you up, Frank.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was sure to come.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>said Frank. <div class="bookquote">``You knew I
should, did you not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I thought you would.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) said, playfully;
<div class="bookquote">``and, Frank, it is so lucky! There's not a soul in my
house but me to-night. I've packed them all off so
nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady's
bower. Liddy wanted to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grandfather's to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) holiday, and I said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might stay
with them till to-morrow -- when you'll be gone again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Capital.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy.<div class="bookquote">'' But, dear me, I. had better
go back for my bag, because my slippers and brush and
comb are in it; you run home whilst I fetch it, and I'll
promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) turned and tripped up the hill again.
During the progress of this dialogue there was a
nervous twitching of Boldwood's tightly closed lips, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) face became bathed in a clammy dew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) now
started forward towards Troy. Troy turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) and
took up the bag.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) I have come to give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up and
cannot marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the soldier</b></font>)</div>said the soldier, mockingly.
<div class="bookquote">``No, no; wait a minute. I want to say more to
you -- more to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, in a hoarse whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``Now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy,<div class="bookquote">'' you see my dilemma. Perhaps
I am a bad man -- the victim of my impulses -- led away
to do what I ought to leave undone. I can't, however,
marry them both. And I have two reasons for- choosing
Fanny. First, I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best upon the whole, and
second, you make it worth my while.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>At the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) by the neck. Troy felt Boldwood's grasp slowly
tightening. The move was absolutely unexpected.
<div class="bookquote">``A moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``You are injuring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) you
love!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer.
Give me breath.'' said Troy.
Boldwood loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand, saying, ``By Heaven,
I've a mind to kill you!''
``And ruin her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''
``Save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''
``Oh, how can she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) be saved now, unless I marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''
Boldwood groaned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) reluctantly released the
soldier, and flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) back against the hedge. ``Devil,
you torture me!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
Troy rebounded like a ball, and was about to make
a dash at the farmer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) checked himself, saying
lightly --
``It is not worth while to measure my strength with
you. Indeed it is a barbarous way of settling a quarrel.
I shall shortly leave the army because of the same
conviction. Now after that revelation of how the land
lies with Bathsheba, `twould be a mistake to kill me,
would it not?<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>`Twould be a mistake to kill you.'' repeated Boldwood,
mechanically, with a bowed head.
``Better kill yourself.''
``Far better.''
``I'm glad you see it.''
``Troy, make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) your wife, and don't act upon what
I arranged just now. The alternative is dreadful, but
take Bathsheba; I give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must love you
indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
has done. Wretched woman -- deluded woman -- you
are, Bathsheba!''
``But about Fanny?''
``Bathsheba is a woman well to do.<div class="bookquote">'' continued Bold-
wood, in nervous anxiety, and, Troy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) will make a
good wife; and, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) is worth your hastening
on your marriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba a woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a will-not to say a temper, and I shall
be a mere slave to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I could do anything with poor
Fanny Robin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Troy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, imploringly,<div class="bookquote">'' I'll do anything
for you, only don't desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); pray don't desert her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>),
Troy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which, poor Fanny?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; Bathsheba Everdene. Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best! Love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tenderly! How shall I get you to see how advan-
tageous it will be to you to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at once?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in any new way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards Troy's
person again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) repressed the instinct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) form
drooped as with pain.
Troy went on --
<div class="bookquote">``I shall soon purchase my discharge, and then -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I wish you to hasten on this marriage! It will
be better for you both. You love each other, and you
must let me help you to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba
instead of Fanny, to enable you to marry at once.
No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wouldn't have it of me. I'll pay it down to
you on the wedding-day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood's
wild infatuation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) carelessly said, <div class="bookquote">``And am I to
have anything now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you wish to. But I have not much additional
money with me. I did not expect this; but all I have
is yours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful
man, pulled out the large canvas bag he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) carried by way
of a purse, and searched it.
<div class="bookquote">``I have twenty-one pounds more with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Two notes and a sovereign. But before I leave you
I must have a paper signed -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pay me the money, and we'll go straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
parlour, and make any arrangement you please to secure
my compliance with your wishes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must know
nothing of this cash business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``Here
is the sum, and if you'll come to my house we'll write
out the agreement for the remainder, and the terms
also.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``First we'll call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But why? Come with me to-night, and go with
me to-morrow to the surrogate's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must be consulted; at any rate informed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well; go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>They went up the hill to Bathsheba's house. When
they stood at the entrance, Troy said, <div class="bookquote">``Wait here a
moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div>Opening the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) glided inside, leaving
the door ajar.
Boldwood waited. In two minutes a light appeared
in the passage. Boldwood then saw that the chain
had been fastened across the door. Troy appeared
inside, carrying a bedroom candlestick.
<div class="bookquote">``What, did you think I should break in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said
Boldwood, contemptuously.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, it is merely my humour to secure things.
Will you read this a moment? I'll hold the light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy handed a folded newspaper through the slit
between door and doorpost, and put the candle close.
<div class="bookquote">``That's the paragraph.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said, placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) finger on
a line.
Boldwood looked and read --
``MARRIAGES.
``On the 17th inst., at St. Ambrose's Church, Bath,
by the Rev. G. Mincing, B.A., Francis Troy, only son
of the late Edward Troy, Esq., H.D., of Weatherbury,
and sergeant with Dragoon Guards, to Bathsheba, only
surviving daughter of the late Mr, John Everdene, of
Casterbridge.''
``This may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey,
Boldwood?'' said Troy. A low gurgle of derisive
laughter followed the words.
The paper fell from Boldwood's hands. Troy
continued --
``Fifty pounds to marry Fanny, Good. Twenty--
one pounds not to marry Fanny, but Bathsheba. Good.
Finale: already Bathsheba's husband. Now, Boldwood,
yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends inter-
ference between a man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wife. And another
word. Bad as I am, I am not such a villain as to
make the marriage or misery of any woman a matter
of huckster and sale. Fanny has long ago left me.
don't know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is. I have searched everywhere.
Another word yet. You say you love Bathsheba; yet
on the merest apparent evidence you instantly believe
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dishonour. A fig for such love! Now that I've
taught you a lesson, take your money back again.''
``I will not; I will not!'' said Boldwood, in a hiss.
``Anyhow I won't have it.'' said Troy, contemptuously.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wrapped the packet of gold in the notes, and threw
the whole into the road.
Boldwood shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) clenched fist at him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
juggler of Satan! You black hound! But I'll punish
you yet; mark me, I'll punish you yet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Another peal of laughter. Troy then closed the
door, and locked himself in.
Throughout the whole of that night Boldwood's dark
downs of Weatherbury like an unhappy Shade in the
Mournful Fields by Acheron.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXV



<p/>AT AN UPPER WINDOW


<p/>IT was very early the next morning -- a time of sun and
dew. The confused beginnings of many birds' songs
spread into the healthy air, and the wan blue of the
heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of
incorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring
day. All the lights in the scene were yellow as to
colour, and all the shadows were attenuated as to form.
The creeping plants about the old manor-house were
bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which had upon
objects behind them the effect of minute lenses of high
magnifying power.
Just before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and
Coggan passed the village cross, and went on together
to the fields. They were yet barely in view of their
mistress's house, when Oak fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) saw the opening
of a casement in one of the upper windows. The two
men were at this moment partially screened by an elder
bush, now beginning to be enriched with black bunches
of fruit, and they paused before emerging from its
shade.
A handsome man leaned idly from the lattice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked east and then west, in the manner of one who
makes a first morning survey. The man was Sergeant
Troy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) red jacket was loosely thrown on, but not
buttoned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) had altogether the relaxed bearing of
a soldier taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) ease.
Coggan spoke first, looking quietly at the window.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has married him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) said.
Gabriel had previously beheld the sight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) now
stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) back turned, making no reply.
<div class="bookquote">``I fancied we should know something to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>con-
tinued Coggan. ``I heard wheels pass my door just
after dark -- you were out somewhere.``He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) glanced
round upon Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens above us, Oak,
how white your face is; you look like a corpse!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, with a faint smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Lean on the gate: I'll wait a bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All right, all right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>They stood by the gate awhile, Gabriel listlessly
staring at the ground. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mind sped into the future,
and saw there enacted in years of leisure the scenes o
repentance that would ensue from this work of haste
That they were married he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had instantly decided. Why
had it been so mysteriously managed? It had become
known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had had a fearful journey to Bath, owing
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) miscalculating the distance: that the horse had
broken down, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had been more than two
days getting there. It was not Bathsheba's way to do
things furtively. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was candour
itself. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) have been entrapped? The union
was not only an unutterable grief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>): it amazed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), notwithstanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had passed the preceding
week in a suspicion that such might be the issue of
Troy's meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) away from home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) quiet return
with liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread.
Just as that imperceptible motion which appears like
stillness is infinitely divided in its properties from stili
ness itself, so had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hope undistinguishable from
despair differed from despair indeed.
In a few minutes they moved on again towards the
house. The sergeant still looked from the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Morning, comrades!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) shouted, in a cheery voice,
when they came up.
Coggan replied to the greeting. <div class="bookquote">``Bain't ye going to
answer the man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) then said to Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``I'd say
good morning -- you needn't spend a hapenny of meaning
upon it, and yet keep the man civil.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel soon decided too that, since the deed was
done, to put the best face upon the matter would be the
greatest kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) loved.
<div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Sergeant Troy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) returned, in a
ghastly voice.
<div class="bookquote">``A rambling, gloomy house this.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, smiling.
<div class="bookquote">``Why -- they may not be married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>suggested Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head. The soldier turned a little
towards the east, and the sun kindled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) scarlet coat
to an orange glow.
<div class="bookquote">``But it is a nice old house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>responded Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes -- I suppose so; but I feel like new wine in an
old bottle here. My notion is that sash-windows should
be put throughout, and these old wainscoted walls
brightened up a bit; or the oak cleared quite away, and
the walls papered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be a pity, I think.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Well, no. A philosopher once said in my hearing
that the old builders, who worked when art was a living
thing, had no respect for the work of builders who went
before them, but pulled down and altered as they
thought fit; and why shouldn't we?<div class="bookquote">''`Creation and
preservation don't do well together.''  (<font color='red'><b>builders</b></font>)</div>says he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and a
million of antiquarians can't invent a style.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My mind
exactly. I am for making this place more modern, that
we may be cheerful whilst we can.''
The military man turned and surveyed the interior
of the room, to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas of improvement in this
direction. Gabriel and Coggan began to move on.
``Oh, Coggan.<div class="bookquote">'' said Troy, as if inspired by a recollec-
tion''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>do you know if insanity has ever appeared in Mr.
Boldwood's family?''
Jan reflected for a moment.
``I once heard that an uncle of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was queer in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
head, but I don't know the rights o`t.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) said.
``It is of no importance.'' said Troy, lightly. ``Well,
I shall be down in the fields with you some time this
week; but I have a few matters to attend to first. So
good-day to you. We shall, of course, keep on just as
friendly terms as usual. I'm not a proud man: nobody
is ever able to say that of Sergeant Troy. However,
what is must be, and here's half-a-crown to drink my
health, men.''
Troy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot
and over the fence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in
its fall, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face turning to an angry red. Coggan
twirled his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) eye, edged forward, and caught the money
in its ricochet upon the road.
``very well-you keep it, Coggan.'' said Gabriel with
disdain and almost fiercely. ``As for me, I'll do with-
out gifts from him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)!''
``Don't show it too much.'' said Coggan, musingly.
``For if he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)'s married to her (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>), mark my words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)'ll buy
his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) discharge and be our master here. Therefore `tis
well to say `Friend' outwardly, though you say
`Troublehouse' within.''
``Well-perhaps it is best to be silent; but I can't
go further than that. I can't flatter, and if my place
here is only to be kept by smoothing him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) down, my
place must be lost.''
A horseman, whom they had for some time seen in
the distance, now appeared close beside them.
``There's Mr. Boldwood.<div class="bookquote">'' said Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>I wonder what
Troy meant by his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) question.''
Coggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer,
just checked their paces to discover if they were wanted,
and finding they were not stood back to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) pass on.
The only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had
been combating through the night, and was combating
now, were the want of colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) well-defined face,
the enlarged appearance of the veins in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) forehead
and temples, and the sharper lines about his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) mouth.
The horse bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) away, and the very step of the
animal seemed significant of dogged despair. Gabriel, for
a minute, rose above his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own grief in noticing Boldwood's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) saw the square figure sitting erect upon the horse,
the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by
the hips, the brim of the hat level and undisturbed in
its onward glide, until the keen edges of Boldwood's
shape sank by degrees over the hill. To one who knew
the man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story there was something more striking
in this immobility than in a collapse. The clash of
discord between mood and matter here was forced
painfully home to the heart; and, as in laughter there are
more dreadful phases than in tears, so was there in the
steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper
than a cry.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI



<p/>WEALTH IN JEOPARDY -- THE REVEL


<p/>ONE night, at the end of August, when Bathsheba's
experiences as a married woman were still new, and
when the weather was yet dry and sultry, a man stood
motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper
Farm, looking at the moon and sky.
The night had a sinister aspect. A heated breeze
from the south slowly fanned the summits of lofty
objects, and in the sky dashes of buoyant cloud were
sailing in a course at right angles to that of another
stratum, neither of them in the direction of the breeze
below. The moon, as seen through these films, had
a lurid metallic look. The fields were sallow with the
impure light, and all were tinged in monochrome, as
if beheld through stained glass. The same evening
the sheep had trailed homeward head to tail, the
behaviour of the rooks had been confused, and the
horses had moved with timidity and caution.
Thunder was imminent, and, taking some secondary
appearances into consideration, it was likely to be
followed by one of the lengthened rains which mark
the close of dry weather for the season. Before twelve
hours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a
bygone thing.
Oak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and un-
protected ricks, massive and heavy with the rich
produce of one-half the farm for that year. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went
on to the barn.
This was the night which had been selected by
Sergeant Troy -- ruling now in the room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) wife --
for giving the harvest supper and dance. As Oak
approached the building the sound of violins and a
tambourine, and the regular jigging of many feet, grew
more distinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) came close to the large doors, one
of which stood slightly ajar, and looked in.
The central space, together with the recess at one
end, was emptied of all incumbrances, and this area,
covering about two-thirds of the whole, was appropriated
for the gathering, the remaining end, which was piled
to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with sail-
cloth. Tufts and garlands of green foliage decorated
the walls, beams, and extemporized chandeliers, and
immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had been
erected, bearing a table and chairs. Here sat three
fiddlers, and beside them stood a frantic man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hair on end, perspiration streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheeks,
and a tambourine quivering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
The dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the
midst a new row of couples formed for another.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, ma'am, and no offence I hope, I ask what
dance you would like next?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first violin.
<div class="bookquote">``Really, it makes no difference.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>said the clear voice
of Bathsheba, who stood at the inner end of the build-
ing, observing the scene from behind a table covered
with cups and viands. Troy was lolling beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Then.''  (<font color='red'><b>the fiddler</b></font>)</div>said the fiddler, ``I'll venture to name that
the right and proper thing is ``The Soldier's Joy<div class="bookquote">'' --
there being a gallant soldier married into the farm --
hey, my sonnies, and gentlemen all?''
 (<font color='red'><b>right Soldier Joy</b></font>)</div>``It shall be ``The Soldier's Joy,'' exclaimed a
chorus.
``Thanks for the compliment.'' said the sergeant
gaily, taking Bathsheba by the hand and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
to the top of the dance. ``For though I have pur-
chased my discharge from Her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) Most Gracious Majesty's
regiment of cavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards, to attend
to the new duties awaiting me here, I shall continue a
soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I live.''
So the dance began. As to the merits of ``The
Soldier's Joy.'' there cannot be, and never were, two
opinions. It has been observed in the musical circles
of Weatherbury and its vicinity that this melody, at
the end of three-quarters of an hour of thunderous
footing, still possesses more stimulative properties for
the heel and toe than the majority of other dances at
their first opening. ``The Soldier's Joy'' has, too, an
additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to
the tambourine aforesaid -- no mean instrument in the
hands of a performer who understands the proper
convulsions, spasms, St. vitus's dances, and fearful
frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their
highest perfection.
The immortal tune ended, a fine DD rolling forth
from the bass-viol with the sonorousness of a cannonade,
and Gabriel delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) entry no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) avoided
Bathsheba, and got as near as possible to the platform,
where Sergeant Troy was now seated, drinking brandy-
and-water, though the others drank without exception
cider and ale. Gabriel could not easily thrust himself
within speaking distance of the sergeant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sent
a message, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to come down for a moment.
``The sergeant said he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) could not attend.
<div class="bookquote">``Will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>), then.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``that I only
stepped ath`art to say that a heavy rain is sure to fall
soon, and that something should be done to protect
the ricks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``M. Troy says it will not rain.''  (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>returned the
messenger, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) cannot stop to talk to you about
such fidgets.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the messenger</b></font>)</div>In Juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy
tendency to look like a candle beside gas, and ill at
ease, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) went out again, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would go home;
for, under the circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had no heart for the
scene in the barn. At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) paused for a
moment: Troy was speaking.
<div class="bookquote">``Friends, it is not only the harvest home that we
are celebrating to-night; but this is also a Wedding
Feast. A short time ago I had the happiness to lead
to the altar this lady, your mistress, and not until now
have we been able to give any public flourish to the
event in Weatherbury. That it may be thoroughly
well done, and that every man may go happy to bed,
I have ordered to be brought here some bottles of
brandy and kettles of hot water. A treble-strong
goblet will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handed round to each guest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba put her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) arm, and, with
upturned pale face, said imploringly,<div class="bookquote">'' No -- don't give
it to them -- pray don't, Frank! It will only do them
harm: they have had enough of everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True -- we don't wish for no more, thank ye.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
one or two.
<div class="bookquote">``Pooh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant contemptuously, and
raised his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) voice as if lighted up by a new idea.
<div class="bookquote">``Friends.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said,'' we'll send the women-folk home!
``Tis time they were in bed. Then we cockbirds will
have a jolly carouse to ourselves! If any of the men
show the white feather, let them look elsewhere for a
winter's work.''
Bathsheba indignantly left the barn, followed by
all the women and children. The musicians, not
looking upon themselves as ``company.'' slipped quietly
away to their spring waggon and put in the horse.
Thus Troy and the men on the farm were left sole
occupants of the place. Oak, not to appear unneces-
sarily disagreeable, stayed a little while; then he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>), too,
arose and quietly took his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) departure, followed by a
friendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a
second round of grog.
Gabriel proceeded towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) home. In approach-
ing the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) toe kicked something which felt and
sounded soft, leathery, and distended, like a boxing-
glove. It was a large toad humbly travelling across
the path. Oak took it up, thinking it might be better
to kill the creature to save it from pain; but finding
it uninjured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) placed it again among the grass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
knew what this direct message from the Great Mother
meant. And soon came another.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) struck a light indoors there appeared upon
the table a thin glistening streak, as if a brush of varnish
had been lightly dragged across it. Oak's eyes followed
the serpentine sheen to the other side, where it led up
to a huge brown garden-slug, which had come indoors
to-night for reasons of its own. It was Nature's second
way of hinting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was to prepare for foul
weather.
Oak sat down meditating for nearly an hour.
During this time two black spiders, of the kind common
in thatched houses, promenaded the ceiling, ultimately
dropping to the floor. This reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) that if there
was one class of manifestation on this matter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
thoroughly understood, it was the instincts of sheep.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) left the room, ran across two or three fields towards
the flock, got upon a hedge, and looked over among
them.
They were crowded close together on the other side
around some furze bushes, and the first peculiarity ob-
servable was that, on the sudden appearance of Oak's
head over the fence, they did not stir or run away.
They had now a terror of something greater than their
terror of man. But this was not the most noteworthy
feature: they were all grouped in such a way that their
tails, without a single exception, were towards that half
of the horizon from which the storm threatened. There
was an inner circle closely huddled, and outside these
they radiated wider apart, the pattern formed by the
flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace
collar, to which the clump of furze-bushes stood in the
position of a wearer's neck.
opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was right, and that
Troy was wrong. Every voice in nature was unanimous
in bespeaking change. But two distinct translations
attached to these dumb expressions. Apparently there
was to be a thunder-storm, and afterwards a cold con-
tinuous rain. The creeping things seemed to know all
about the later rain, hut little of the interpolated
thunder-storm; whilst the sheep knew all about the
thunder-storm and nothing of the later rain.
This complication of weathers being uncommon,
was all the more to be feared. Oak returned to the
stack-yard. All was silent here, and the conical tips of
the ricks jutted darkly into the sky. There were five
wheat-ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley.
The wheat when threshed would average about thirty
quarters to each stack; the barley, at least forty. Their
value to Bathsheba, and indeed to anybody, Oak
mentally estimated by the following simple calcula-
tion: --
5 x 30 = 150 quarters= 500 L.
3 x 40=120 quarters= 250 L.
Total . . 750 L.
Seven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form
that money can wear -- that of necessary food for man
and beast: should the risk be run of deteriorating this
bulk of corn to less than half its value, because of the
instability of a woman?``Never, if I can prevent it!''
said Gabriel.
Such was the argument that Oak set outwardly before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>). But man, even to himself, is a palimpsest, having
an ostensible writing, and another beneath the lines.
It is possible that there was this golden legend under
the utilitarian one: ``I will help to my last effort the
woman I have loved so dearly.<div class="bookquote">''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain
assistance for covering the ricks that very night. All
was silent within, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would have passed on in the
belief that the party had broken up, had not a dim
light, yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish
whiteness outside, streamed through a knot-hole in the
folding doors.
Gabriel looked in. An unusual picture met his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eye.
The candles suspended among the evergreens had
burnt down to their sockets, and in some cases the
leaves tied about them were scorched. Many of the
lights had quite gone out, others smoked and stank,
grease dropping from them upon the floor. Here,
under the table, and leaning against forms and chairs
in every conceivable attitude except the perpendicular,!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>were the wretched persons of all the work-folk, the hair
of their heads at such low levels being suggestive of
mops and brooms. In the midst of these shone red
and distinct the figure of Sergeant Troy, leaning back
in a chair. Coggan was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) back, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) mouth
open, huzzing forth snores, as were several others; the
united breathings of the horizonal assemblage forming
a subdued roar like London from a distance. Joseph
Poorgrass was curled round in the fashion of a hedge-
hog, apparently in attempts to present the least possible
portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) surface to the air; and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) was
dimly visible an unimportant remnant of William Small-
bury. The glasses and cups still stood upon the table,
a water-jug being overturned, from which a small rill,
after tracing its course with marvellous precision down
the centre of the long table, fell into the neck of the
unconscious Mark Clark, in a steady, monotonous drip,
like the dripping of a stalactite in a cave.
Gabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with
one or two exceptions, composed all the able-bodied
men upon the farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw at once that if the ricks
were to be saved that night, or even the next morning,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) must save them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own hands.
A faint <div class="bookquote">``ting-ting''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>resounded from under Coggan's
waistcoat. It was Coggan's watch striking the hour of
two.
Oak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon,
who usually undertook the rough thatching of the home-
stead, and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Moon</b></font>). The shaking was without effect.
Gabriel shouted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``where's your thatching-
beetle and rick-stick and spars?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Under the staddles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Matthew Moon/Matthew/Moon</b></font>)</div>said Moon, mechanically, with
the unconscious promptness of a medium.
Gabriel let go his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) head, and it dropped upon the
floor like a bowl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) then went to Susan Tall's
husband.
<div class="bookquote">``where's the key of the granary?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No answer. The question was repeated, with the
same result. To be shouted to at night was evidently
less of a novelty to Susan Tall's husband than to
Matthew Moon. Oak flung down Tall's head into the
corner again and turned away.
To be just, the men were not greatly to blame for
this painful and demoralizing termination to the
evening's entertainment. Sergeant Troy had so strenu-
ously insisted, glass in hand, that drinking should be
the bond of their union, that those who wished to refuse
hardly liked to be so unmannerly under the circum-
stances. Having from their youth up been entirely un-
accustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild
ale, it was no wonder that they had succumbed, one
and all, with extraordinary uniformity, after the lapse of
about an hour.
Gabriel was greatly depressed. This debauch boded
ill for that wilful and fascinating mistress whom the
faithful man even now felt within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as the embodi-
ment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put out the expiring lights, that the barn might
not be endangered, closed the door upon the men in
their deep and oblivious sleep, and went again into the
lone night. A hot breeze, as if breathed from the
parted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe,
fanned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the south, while directly opposite in
the north rose a grim misshapen body of cloud, in the
very teeth of the wind. So unnaturally did it rise that
one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below.
Meanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the
south-east corner of the sky, as if in terror of the large
cloud, like a young brood gazed in upon by some
monster.
Going on to the village, Oak flung a small stone
against the window of Laban Tall's bedroom, expecting
Susan to open it; but nobody stirred. He (<font color='blue'><b>monster</b></font>) went round
to the back door, which had been left unfastened for
Laban's entry, and passed in to the foot of the stair-
case.
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tall, I've come for the key of the granary,
to get at the rick-cloths.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, in a stentorian
voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``Come along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue --
keeping a body awake like this .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It isn't Laban -- `tis Gabriel Oak. I want the key
of the granary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gabriel. what in the name of fortune did you
pretend to be Laban for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I didn't. I thought you meant -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes you did! what do you want here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The key of the granary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Take it then. <div class="bookquote">``Tis on the nail. People coming
disturbing women at this time of night ought -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the
conclusion of the tirade. Ten minutes later his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lonely
figure might have been seen dragging four large water-
proof coverings across the yard, and soon two of these
heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug -- two cloths
to each. Two hundred pounds were secured. Three
wheat-stacks remained open, and there were no more
cloths. Oak looked under the staddles and found a
fork. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mounted the third pile of wealth and began
operating, adopting the plan of sloping the upper
sheaves one over the other; and, in addition, filling
the interstices with the material of some untied sheaves.
So far all was well. By this hurried contrivance
Bathsheba's property in wheat was safe for at any rate
a week or two, provided always that there was not
much wind.
Next came the barley. This it was only possible to
protect by systematic thatching. Time went on, and
the moon vanished not to reappear. It was the
farewell of the ambassador previous to war. The
night had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and there
came finally an utter expiration of air from the whole
heaven in the form of a slow breeze, which might have
been likened to a death. And now nothing was heard
in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove
in the spars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII



<p/>THE STORM -- THE TWO TOGETHER


<p/>A LIGHT flapped over the scene, as if reflected from
phosphorescent wings crossing the sky, and a rumble
filled the air. It was the first move of the approaching
storm.
The second peal was noisy, with comparatively little
visible lightning. Gabriel saw a candle shining in Bath-
sheba's bedroom, and soon a shadow swept to and fro
upon the blind.
Then there came a third flash. Manoeuvres of a
most extraordinary kind were going on in the vast
firmamental hollows overhead. The lightning now was
the colour of silver, and gleamed in the heavens like a
mailed army. Rumbles became rattles. Gabriel from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) elevated position could see over the landscape at
least half-a-dozen miles in front. Every hedge, bush,
and tree was distinct as in a line engraving. In a
paddock in the same direction was a herd of heifers,
and the forms of these were visible at this moment in
the act of galloping about in the wildest and maddest
confusion, flinging their heels and tails high into the air,
their heads to earth. A poplar in the immediate fore-
ground was like an ink stroke on burnished tin. Then
the picture vanished, leaving the darkness so intense
that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ricking-rod, or poniard, as it was
indifferently called -- a long iron lance, polished by
handling -- into the stack, used to support the sheaves
instead of the support called a groom used on houses,
A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some in-
describable manner flickered down near the top of the
rod. It was the fourth of the larger flashes. A moment
later and there was a smack -- smart, clear, and short,
Gabriel felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) position to be anything but a safe one,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) resolved to descend.
Not a drop of rain had fallen as yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
weary brow, and looked again at the black forms of
the unprotected stacks. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life so valuable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) after all? What were his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) prospects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
should be so chary of running risk, when important
and urgent labour could not be carried on without
such risk? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) resolved to stick to the stack. How-
ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) took a precaution. Under the staddles was
a long tethering chain, used to prevent the escape of
errant horses. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) carried up the ladder, and
sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) rod through the clog at one end, allowed
the other end of the chain to trail upon the ground
The spike attached to it he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) drove in. Under the
shadow of this extemporized lightning-conductor he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
felt himself comparatively safe.
Before Oak had laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tools again
out leapt the fifth flash, with the spring of a serpent
and the shout of a fiend. It was green as an
emerald, and the reverberation was stunning. What
was this the light revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)? In the open
ground before him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) looked over the ridge of
the rick, was a dark and apparently female form.
Could it be that of the only venturesome woman in
the parish -- Bathsheba? The form moved on a step:
then he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could see no more.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that you, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel to the darkness.
<div class="bookquote">``Who is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>said the voice of Bathsheba,
<div class="bookquote">``Gabriel. I am on the rick, thatching.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Gabriel! -- and are you? I have come about
them. The weather awoke me, and I thought of the
corn. I am so distressed about it -- can we save it any-
how? I cannot find my husband. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) is not here.''
``Do you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is?''
``Asleep in the barn.''
``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) promised that the stacks should be seen to,
and now they are all neglected! Can I do anything
to help? Liddy is afraid to come out. Fancy finding
you here at such an hour! Surely I can do something?''
``You can bring up some reed-sheaves to me, one by
one, ma'am; if you are not afraid to come up the ladder
in the dark.'' said Gabriel. ``Every moment is precious
now, and that would save a good deal of time. It is
not very dark when the lightning has been gone a bit.''
``I'll do anything!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, resolutely. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instantly
took a sheaf upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder, clambered up close to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heels, placed it behind the rod, and descended for
another. At her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) third ascent the rick suddenly brightened
with the brazen glare of shining majolica -- every knot
in every straw was visible. On the slope in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
appeared two human shapes, black as jet. The rick
lost its sheen -- the shapes vanished. Gabriel turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
head. It had been the sixth flash which had come from
the east behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and the two dark forms on the
slope had been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba.
Then came the peal. It hardly was credible that
such a heavenly light could be the parent of such a
diabolical sound.
``How terrible!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) exclaimed, and clutched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) by
the sleeve. Gabriel turned, and steadied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
aerial perch by holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm. At the same moment,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was still reversed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) attitude, there was
more light, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw, as it were, a copy of the tall
poplar tree on the hill drawn in black on the wall of
the barn. It was the shadow of that tree, thrown across
by a secondary flash in the west.
The next flare came. Bathsheba was on the ground
now, shouldering another sheaf, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) bore its dazzle
without flinching -- thunder and ali-and again ascended
with the load. There was then a silence everywhere
for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars,
as Gabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly
heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) thought the crisis of the storm had passed.
But there came a burst of light.
``Hold on!'' said Gabriel, taking the sheaf from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
shoulder, and grasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm again.
Heaven opened then, indeed. The flash was almost
too novel for its inexpressibly dangerous nature to be
at once realized, and they could only comprehend the
magnificence of its beauty. It sprang from east, west,
north, south, and was a perfect dance of death. The
forms of skeletons appeared in the air, shaped with
blue fire for bones -- dancing, leaping, striding, racing
around, and mingling altogether in unparalleled con-
fusion. With these were intertwined undulating snakes of
green, and behind these was a broad mass of lesser light.
Simultaneously came from every part of the tumbling
sky what may be called a shout; since, though no shout
ever came near it, it was more of the nature of a shout
than of anything else earthly. In the meantime one of
the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel's
rod, to run invisibly down it, down the chain, and into
the earth. Gabriel was almost blinded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could
feel Bathsheba's warm arm tremble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand -- a
sensation novel and thrilling enough; but love, life,
everything human, seemed small and trifling in such
close juxtaposition with an infuriated universe.
Oak had hardly time to gather up these impressions
into a thought, and to see how strangely the red feather
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) hat shone in this light, when the tall tree on the
hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a white heat,
and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with
the last crash of those preceding. It was a stupefying
blast, harsh and pitiless, and it fell upon their ears in a
dead, flat blow, without that reverberation which lends
the tones of a drum to more distant thunder. By the
lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from the
wide domical scoop above it, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) saw that the tree was
sliced down the whole length of its tall, straight stem, a
huge riband of bark being apparently flung off. The
other portion remained erect, and revealed the bared
surface as a strip of white down the front. The
lightning had struck the tree. A sulphurous smell
filled the air; then all was silent, and black as a cave
in Hinnom.
``We had a narrow escape!'' said Gabriel, hurriedly.
``You had better go down.''
Bathsheba said nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could distinctly hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) rhythmical pants, and the recurrent rustle of the
sheaf beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) frightened pulsations.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) descended the ladder, and, on second thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). The darkness was now impenetrable by
the sharpest vision. They both stood still at the
bottom, side by side. Bathsheba appeared to think
only of the weather -- Oak thought only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) just then.
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said --
``The storm seems to have passed now, at any
rate.''
``I think so too.'' said Bathsheba. ``Though there
are multitudes of gleams, look!''
The sky was now filled with an incessant light,
frequent repetition melting into complete continuity, as
an unbroken sound results from the successive strokes
on a gong.
``Nothing serious.'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). ``I cannot understand
no rain falling. But Heaven be praised, it is all the
better for us. I am now going up again.''
``Gabriel, you are kinder than I deserve! I will stay
and help you yet. O, why are not some of the others
here!''
``They would have been here if they could.'' said Oak,
in a hesitating way.
``O, I know it all -- all.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, adding slowly:
``They are all asleep in the barn, in a drunken sleep, and
my husband among them. That's it, is it not? Don't
think I am a timid woman and can't endure things.''
``I am not certain.'' said Gabriel. ``I will go and see,''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) crossed to the barn, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) there alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
looked through the chinks of the door. All was in
total darkness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had left it, and there still arose, as
at the former time, the steady buzz of many snores.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) felt a zephyr curling about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cheek, and turned.
It was Bathsheba's breath -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and
was looking into the same chink.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) endeavoured to put off the immediate and pain-
ful subject of their thoughts by remarking gently, ``If
you'll come back again, miss -- ma'am, and hand up a
few more; it would save much time.''
Then Oak went back again, ascended to the top,
stepped off the ladder for greater expedition, and went
on thatching. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) followed, but without a sheaf
``Gabriel.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, in a strange and impressive voice.
Oak looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had not spoken since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) left the barn. The soft and continual shimmer of
the dying lightning showed a marble face high against
the black sky of the opposite quarter. Bathsheba was
sitting almost on the apex of the stack, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) feet gathered
up beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and resting on the top round of the
ladder.
``Yes, mistress.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said.
``I suppose you thought that when I galloped away
to Bath that night it was on purpose to be married?''
``I did at last -- not at first.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) answered, somewhat
surprised at the abruptness with which this new subject
was broached.
``And others thought so, too?''
``Yes.''
``And you blamed me for it?''
``Well-a little.''
``I thought so. Now, I care a little for your good
opinion, and I want to explain something-i have
longed to do it ever since I returned, and you looked so
gravely at me. For if I were to die -- and I may die
soon -- it would be dreadful that you should always think
mistakenly of me. Now, listen.''
Gabriel ceased his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) rustling.
``I went to Bath that night in the full intention of
breaking off my engagement to Mr. Troy. It was owing
to circumstances which occurred after I got there that
-- that we were married. Now, do you see the matter
in a new light?''
``I do -- somewhat.''
``I must, I suppose, say more, now that I have
begun. And perhaps it's no harm, for you are certainly
under no delusion that I ever loved you, or that I can
have any object in speaking, more than that object I
have mentioned. Well, I was alone in a strange city,
and the horse was lame. And at last I didn't know
what to do. I saw, when it was too late, that scandal
might seize hold of me for meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) alone in that
way. But I was coming away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) suddenly said
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had that day seen a woman more beautiful than I,
and that his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) constancy could not be counted on unless
I at once became his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)... And I was grieved and
troubled -- --'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice, and waited a
moment, as if to gather breath. ``And then, between
jealousy and distraction, I married him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) whispered
with desperate impetuosity.
Gabriel made no reply.
``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was not to blame, for it was perfectly true about
-- about his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seeing somebody else.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) quickly added.
``And now I don't wish for a single remark from you
upon the subject -- indeed, I forbid it. I only wanted
you to know that misunderstood bit of my history before
a time comes when you could never know it. -- You want
some more sheaves?''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went down the ladder, and the work proceeded.
Gabriel soon perceived a languor in the movements of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mistress up and down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), gently as
a mother --
``I think you had better go indoors now, you are
tired. I can finish the rest alone. If the wind does
not change the rain is likely to keep off.''
``If I am useless I will go.'' said Bathsheba, in a
flagging cadence. ``But O, if your life should be lost!''
``You are not useless; but I would rather not tire
you longer. You have done well.''
``And you better!<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, gratefully.! Thank you
for your devotion, a thousand times, Gabriel! Good-
night-i know you are doing your very best for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) diminished in the gloom, and vanished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
heard the latch of the gate fall as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed through.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) worked in a reverie now, musing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) story, and
upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart which
had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to speak more warmly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to-night
than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ever had done whilst unmarried and free to
speak as warmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chose.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was disturbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) meditation by a grating
noise from the coach-house. It was the vane on the
roof turning round, and this change in the wind was the
signal for a disastrous rain.




<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII



<p/>RAIN -- ONE SOLITARY MEETS ANOTHER


<p/>IT was now five o'clock, and the dawn was promising
to break in hues of drab and ash.
The air changed its temperature and stirred itself
more vigorously. Cool breezes coursed in transparent
eddies round Oak's face. The wind shifted yet a point
or two and blew stronger. In ten minutes every wind
of heaven seemed to be roaming at large. Some of the
thatching on the wheat-stacks was now whirled fantas-
tically aloft, and had to be replaced and weighted with
some rails that lay near at hand. This done, Oak slaved
away again at the barley. A huge drop of rain smote
his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) face, the wind snarled round every corner, the trees
rocked to the bases of their trunks, and the twigs clashed
in strife. Driving in spars at any point and on any
system, inch by inch he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) covered more and more safely
from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred
pounds. ``The rain came on in earnest, and Oak soon felt
the water to be tracking cold and clammy routes down
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) back. Ultimately he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was reduced well-nigh to a
homogeneous sop, and the dyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) clothes trickled
down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder.
The rain stretched obliquely through the dull atmo-
sphere in liquid spines, unbroken in continuity between
their beginnings in the clouds and their points in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
Oak suddenly remembered that eight months before
this time he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been fighting against fire in the same
spot as desperately as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was fighting against water
now -- and for a futile love of the same woman. As for
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) -- -- But Oak was generous and true, and dis-
missed his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reflections.
It was about seven o'clock in the dark leaden
morning when Gabriel came down from the last stack,
and thankfully exclaimed, ``It is done!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was
drenched, weary, and sad, and yet not so sad as drenched
and weary, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was cheered by a sense of success in
a good cause.
Faint sounds came from the barn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) looked
that way. Figures stepped singly and in pairs through
the doors -- all walking awkwardly, and abashed, save
the foremost, who wore a red jacket, and advanced
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) pockets, whistling. The others
shambled after with a conscience-stricken air: the whole
procession was not unlike Flaxman's group of the suitors
tottering on towards the infernal regions under the
conduct of Mercury. The gnarled shapes passed into
the village, Troy, their leader, entering the farmhouse.
Not a single one of them had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) face to the
ricks, or apparently bestowed one thought upon their
condition.
Soon Oak too went homeward, by a different route
from theirs. In front of him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) against the wet glazed
surface of the lane he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) saw a person walking yet more
slowly than himself under an umbrella. The man
turned and plainly started; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Boldwood.
``How are you this morning, sir?'' said Oak.
``Yes, it is a wet day. -- Oh, I am well, very well, I
thank you; quite well.''
``I am glad to hear it, sir.''
Boldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees.
``You look tired and ill, Oak.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said then, desultorily
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) companion.
``I am tired. You look strangely altered, sir.''
``I? Not a bit of it: I am well enough. What put
that into your head?''
``I thought you didn't look quite so topping as you
used to, that was all.''
``Indeed, then you are mistaken.'' said Boldwood,
shortly. ``Nothing hurts me. My constitution is an
iron one.''
``I've been working hard to get our ricks covered,
and was barely in time. Never had such a struggle in
my life... Yours of course are safe, sir.''
``O yes.<div class="bookquote">'' Boldwood added, after an interval of
silence: ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What did you ask, Oak?''
``Your ricks are all covered before this time?''
``No.''
``At any rate, the large ones upon the stone staddles?''
``They are not.''
``Them under the hedge?''
``No. I forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it.''
``Nor the little one by the stile?<div class="bookquote">``Nor the little one by the stile. I
overlooked the
ricks this year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then not a tenth of your corn will come to measure,
sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Possibly not.
``Overlooked them.'' repeated Gabriel slowly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)-
self. It is difficult to describe the intensely dramatic
effect that announcement had upon Oak at such a
moment. All the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been feeling that the
neglect he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was labouring to repair was abnormal and
isolated -- the only instance of the kind within the circuit
of the county. Yet at this very time, within the same
parish, a greater waste had been going on, uncomplained
of and disregarded. A few months earlier Boldwood's
forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) husbandry would have been as preposter-
ous an idea as a sailor forgetting he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was in a ship. Oak
was just thinking that whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) himself might have
suffered from Bathsheba's marriage, here was a man
who had suffered more, when Boldwood spoke in a
changed voice -- that of one who yearned to make a
confidence and relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heart by an outpouring.
``Oak, you know as well as I that things have gone
wrong with me lately. I may as well own it. I was
going to get a little settled in life; but in some way my
plan has come to nothing.''
``I thought my mistress would have married you,''
said Gabriel, not knowing enough of the full depths of
Boldwood's love to keep silence on the farmer's account,
and determined not to evade discipline by doing so on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own. ``However, it is so sometimes, and nothing
happens that we expect.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) added, with the repose of
a man whom misfortune had inured rather than sub-
dued.
``I daresay I am a joke about the parish.'' said Bold-
wood, as if the subject came irresistibly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) tongue,
and with a miserable lightness meant to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
indifference.
``O no -- I don't think that.<div class="bookquote">''
-- But the real truth of the matter is that there was
not, as some fancy, any jilting on -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) part. No
engagement ever existed between me and Miss Ever-
dene. People say so, but it is untrue: she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) never
promised me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Boldwood stood still now and turned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wild face to Oak. <div class="bookquote">``O, Gabriel.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I
am weak and foolish, and I don't know what, and I
can't fend off my miserable grief! ... I had some faint
belief in the mercy of God till I lost that woman. Yes,
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prepared a gourd to shade me, and like the prophet
I thanked Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and was glad. But the next day He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it; and
I feel it is better to die than to live!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A silence followed. Boldwood aroused himself from
the momentary mood of confidence into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had
drifted, and walked on again, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) usual reserve,
<div class="bookquote">``No, Gabriel.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) resumed, with a carelessness which
was like the smile on the countenance of a skull: <div class="bookquote">``it
was made more of by other people than ever it was by
us. I do feel a little regret occasionally, but no woman
ever had power over me for any length of time. Well,
good morning; I can trust you not to mention to others
what has passed between us two here.''

<p/>COMING HOME -- A CRY


<p/>ON the turnpike road, between Casterbridge and
Weatherbury, and about three miles from the former
which pervade the highways of this undulating part of
South Wessex. I returning from market it is usual
for the farmers and other gig-gentry to alight at the
bottom and walk up.
One Saturday evening in the month of October
Bathsheba's vehicle was duly creeping up this incline.
She (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) was sitting listlessly in the second seat of the gig,
whilst walking beside her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) in farmer's marketing suit
of unusually fashionable cut was an erect, well-made
young man. Though on foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held the reins and
whip, and occasionally aimed light cuts at the horse's
ear with the end of the lash, as a recreation. This
man was her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) husband, formerly Sergeant Troy, who,
having bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) discharge with Bathsheba's money,
was gradually transforming himself into a farmer of a
spirited and very modern school. People of unalter-
able ideas still insisted upon calling him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Sergeant''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>hen they met him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), which was in some degree owing
to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) having still retained the well-shaped moustache
of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) military days, and the soldierly bearing insepar-
able from his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) form and training.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, if it hadn't been for that wretched rain I
should have cleared two hundred as easy as looking,
my love.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was saying. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you see, it altered
all the chances? To speak like a book I once read,
wet weather is the narrative, and fine days are the
episodes, of our country's history; now, isn't that
true?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the time of year is come for changeable weather.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Well, yes. The fact is, these autumn races are the
ruin of everybody. Never did I see such a day as 'twas!
``Tis a wild open place, just out of Budmouth, and a
drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery. Wind
and rain -- good Lord! Dark? Why, 'twas as black
as my hat before the last race was run. <div class="bookquote">``Twas five
o'clock, and you couldn't see the horses till they were
almost in, leave alone colours. The ground was as
heavy as lead, and all judgment from a fellow's experi-
ence went for nothing. Horses, riders, people, were
all blown about like ships at sea. Three booths were
blown over, and the wretched folk inside crawled out
upon their hands and knees; and in the next field
were as many as a dozen hats at one time. Aye,
Pimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty yards
off, and when I saw Policy stepping on, it did knock
my heart against the lining of my ribs, I assure you,
my love!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you mean, Frank.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, sadly --
her (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) voice was painfully lowered from the fulness and
vivacity of the previous summer -- <div class="bookquote">``that you have lost
more than a hundred pounds in a month by this
dreadful horse-racing? O, Frank, it is cruel; it is
foolish of you to take away my money so. We shall
have to leave the farm; that will be the end of it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Humbug about cruel. Now, there `tis again --
turn on the waterworks; that's just like you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you'll promise me not to go to Budmouth
second meeting, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) implored. Bathsheba
was at the full depth for tears, but she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) maintained a
dry eye.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't see why I should; in fact, if it turns out to
be a fine day, I was thinking of taking you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never, never! I'll go a hundred miles the other
way first. I hate the sound of the very word!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the question of going to see the race or staying
at home has very little to do with the matter. Bets are
all booked safely enough before the race begins, you
may depend. Whether it is a bad race for me or a
good one, will have very little to do with our going
there next Monday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you don't mean to say that you have risked
anything on this one too!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) exclaimed, with an
agonized look.
<div class="bookquote">``There now, don't you be a little fool. Wait till you
are told. Why, Bathsheba, you have lost all the pluck
and sauciness you formerly had, and upon my life if I
had known what a chicken-hearted creature you were
under all your boldness, I'd never have-i know what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>A flash of indignation might have been seen in
Bathsheba's dark eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>farmers</b></font>) looked resolutely ahead
after this reply. They moved on without further
speech, some early-withered leaves from the trees which
hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning
downward across their path to the earth.
A woman appeared on the brow of the hill. The
ridge was in a cutting, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very near the
husband and wife before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became visible. Troy had
turned towards the gig to remount, and whilst putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) foot on the step-the woman passed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
Though the overshadowing trees and the approach
of eventide enveloped them in gloom, Bathsheba could
see plainly enough to discern the extreme poverty of
the woman's garb, and the sadness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``Please, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge
Union-house closes at night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman said these words to Troy over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
shoulder.
Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to recover presence of mind sufficient to
prevent himself from giving way to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) impulse to
suddenly turn and face her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, slowly --
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>The woman, on hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) speak, quickly looked
up, examined the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, and recognized the
soldier under the yeoman's garb. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was drawn
into an expression which had gladness and agony both
among its elements. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uttered an hysterical cry,
and fell down.
<div class="bookquote">``O, poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly
preparing to alight.
<div class="bookquote">``Stay where you are, and attend to the horse!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, peremptorily throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the reins and
the whip. <div class="bookquote">``Walk the horse to the top: I'll see to
the woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear? Clk -- Poppet!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>The horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.
<div class="bookquote">``How on earth did you come here? I thought
you were miles away, or dead! Why didn't you
write to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said Troy to the woman, in a strangely
gentle, yet hurried voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up.
<div class="bookquote">``I feared to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you any money?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good Heaven -- I wish I had more to give you!
Here's -- wretched -- the merest trifle. It is every
farthing I have left. I have none but what my wife
gives me, you know, and I can't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) woman made no answer.
<div class="bookquote">``I have only another moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Troy;
<div class="bookquote">``and now listen. Where are you going to-night?
Casterbridge Union?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I thought to go there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You shan't go there; yet, wait. Yes, perhaps for
to-night; I can do nothing better -- worse luck! Sleep
there to-night, and stay there to-morrow. Monday is
the first free day I have; and on Monday morning,
at ten exactly, meet me on Grey's Bridge just out of the
town. I'll bring all the money I can muster. You
shan't want-i'll see that, Fanny; then I'll get you a
lodging somewhere. Good-bye till then. I am a brute
-- but good-bye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>After advancing the distance which completed the
ascent of the hill, Bathsheba turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. The
woman was upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, and Bathsheba saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
withdrawing from Troy, and going feebly down the
hill by the third milestone from Casterbridge. Troy
then came on towards his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, stepped into the gig,
took the reins from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand, and without making any
observation whipped the horse into a trot. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
rather agitated.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you know who that woman was?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bath-
sheba, looking searchingly into his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face.
<div class="bookquote">``I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, looking boldly back into hers.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you did.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with angry hauteur,
and still regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suddenly seemed to think that frankness would
benefit neither of the women.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing to either of us.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
by sight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How should I know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Think if you will, and be -- -- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The sentence was
completed by a smart cut of the whip round Poppet's
flank, which caused the animal to start forward at a
wild pace. No more was said.




<p/>CHAPTER XL



<p/>ON CASTERBRIDGE HIGHWAY


<p/>FOR a considerable time the woman walked on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
steps became feebler, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes to look
afar upon the naked road, now indistinct amid the
penumbrae of night. At length her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) onward walk
dwindled to the merest totter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened a gate
within which was a haystack. Underneath this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat
down and presently slept.
When the woman awoke it was to find herself in the
depths of a moonless and starless night. A heavy un-
broken crust of cloud stretched across the sky, shutting
out every speck of heaven; and a distant halo which
hung over the town of Casterbridge was visible against
the black concave, the luminosity appearing the
brighter by its great contrast with the circumscribing
darkness. Towards this weak, soft glow the woman
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<div class="bookquote">``If I could only get there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Meet him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
the day after to-morrow: God help me! Perhaps I
shall be in my grave before then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A manor-house clock from the far depths of shadow
struck the hour, one, in a small, attenuated tone. After
midnight the voice of a clock seems to lose in breadth
as much as in length, and to diminish its sonorousness
to a thin falsetto.
Afterwards a light -- two lights -- arose from the re-
mote shade, and grew larger. A carriage rolled along
the road, and passed the gate. It probably contained
some late diners-out. The beams from one lamp shone
for a moment upon the crouching woman, and threw
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face into vivid relieff. The face was young in the
groundwork, old in the finish; the general contours
were flexuous and childlike, but the finer lineaments
had begun to be sharp and thin.
The pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived
determination, and looked around. The road appeared
to be familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) carefully scanned the fence
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slowly walked along. Presently there became
visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers across its face to feel the marks.
<div class="bookquote">``Two more!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leant against the stone as a means of rest for a
short interval, then bestirred herself, and again pursued
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way. For a slight distance she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bore up bravely,
afterwards flagging as before. This was beside a lone
copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon
the leafy ground showed that woodmen had been
faggoting and making hurdles during the day. Now
there was not a rustle, not a breeze, not the faintest
clash of twigs to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) company. The woman
looked over the gate, opened it, and went in. Close
to the entrance stood a row of faggots, bound and un-
bound, together with stakes of all sizes.
For a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense
stillness which signifies itself to be not the end but
merely the suspension, of a previous motion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
attitude was that of a person who listens, either to the
external world of sound, or to the imagined discourse of
thought. A close criticism might have detected signs
proving that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was intent on the latter alternative.
Moreover, as was shown by what followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
oddly exercising the faculty of invention upon the spe-
ciality of the clever Jacquet Droz, the designer of auto-
matic substitutes for human limbs.
By the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, the woman selected two sticks from the
heaps. These sticks were nearly straight to the height
of three or four feet, where each branched into a fork
like the letter Y. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down, snapped off the small
upper twigs, and carried the remainder with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into
the road. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) placed one of these forks under each
arm as a crutch, tested them, timidly threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole
weight upon them -- so little that it was -- and swung
herself forward. The girl had made for herself a
material aid.
The crutches answered well. The pat of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet,
and the tap of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sticks upon the highway, were all the
sounds that came from the traveller now. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
passed the last milestone by a good long distance, and
began to look wistfully towards the bank as if calculating
upon another milestone soon. The crutches, though
so very useful, had their limits of power. Mechanism
only transfers labour, being powerless to supersede it,
and the original amount of exertion was not cleared
away; it was thrown into the body and arms. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
exhausted, and each swing forward became fainter. At
last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) swayed sideways, and fell.
Here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and
more. The morning wind began to boom dully over
the flats, and to move afresh dead leaves which had
lain still since yesterday. The woman desperately
turned round upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees, and next rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
feet. Steadying herself by the help of one crutch, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
essayed a step, then another, then a third, using the
crutches now as walking-sticks only. Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pro-
gressed till descending Mellstock Hill another milestone
appeared, and soon the beginning of an iron-railed fence
came into view. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) staggered across to the first post,
clung to it, and looked around.
The Casterbridge lights were now individually visible,
It was getting towards morning, and vehicles might be
hoped for, if not expected soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) listened. There
was not a sound of life save that acme and sublimation
of all dismal sounds, the hark of a fox, its three hollow
notes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the
precision of a funeral bell.
<div class="bookquote">``Less than a mile!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman murmured. <div class="bookquote">``No;
more.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, after a pause. <div class="bookquote">``The mile is to the
county hall, and my resting-place is on the other side
Casterbridge. A little over a mile, and there I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After an interval she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Five or six steps to
a yard -- six perhaps. I have to go seventeen hundred
yards. A hundred times six, six hundred. Seventeen
times that. O pity me, Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Holding to the rails, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advanced, thrusting one
hand forward upon the rail, then the other, then leaning
over it whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet on beneath.
This woman was not given to soliloquy; but ex-
tremity of feeling lessens the individuality of the weak,
as it increases that of the strong. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said again in the
same tone, <div class="bookquote">``I'll believe that the end lies five posts for-
ward, and no further, and so get strength to pass them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>This was a practical application of the principle that
a half-feigned and fictitious faith is better than no faith
at all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed five posts and held on to the fifth.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll pass five more by believing my longed-for spot
is at the next fifth. I can do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed five more.
<div class="bookquote">``It lies only five further.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed five more.
<div class="bookquote">``But it is five further.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed them.
<div class="bookquote">``That stone bridge is the end of my journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said, when the bridge over the Froom was in view.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crawled to the bridge. During the effort each
breath of the woman went into the air as if never to
return again.
<div class="bookquote">``Now for the truth of the matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, sitting
down. <div class="bookquote">``The truth is, that I have less than half a mile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Self-beguilement with what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known all the time
to be false had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength to come over half
a mile that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have been powerless to face in
the lump. The artifice showed that the woman, by
some mysterious intuition, had grasped the paradoxical
truth that blindness may operate more vigorously than
prescience, and the short-sighted effect more than the
far-seeing; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness,
is needed for striking a blow.
The half-mile stood now before the sick and weary
woman like a stolid Juggernaut. It was an impassive
King of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) world. The road here ran across Durnover
Moor, open to the road on either side. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) surveyed
the wide space, the lights, herself, sighed, and lay down
against a guard-stone of the bridge.
Never was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the
traveller here exercised hers. Every conceivable aid,
method, stratagem, mechanism, by which these last
desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by a
human being unperceived, was revolved in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) busy
brain, and dismissed as impracticable. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought of
sticks, wheels, crawling -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even thought of rolling.
But the exertion demanded by either of these latter two
was greater than to walk erect. The faculty of con-
trivance was worn out, Hopelessness had come at
last.
<div class="bookquote">``No further!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered, and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
From the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of
the bridge a portion of shade seemed to detach itself
and move into isolation upon the pale white of the road.
It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) became conscious of something touching her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hand; it was softness and it was warmth. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye's, and the substance touched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face.
A dog was licking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek.
He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing
darkly against the low horizon, and at least two feet
higher than the present position of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. Whether
Newfoundland, mastiff, bloodhound, or what not, it was
impossible to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to be of too strange and
mysterious a nature to belong to any variety among those
of popular nomenclature. Being thus assignable to no
breed, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the ideal embodiment of canine greatness
-- a generalization from what was common to all. Night,
in its sad, solemn, and benevolent aspect, apart from its
stealthy and cruel side, was personified in this form
Darkness endows the small and ordinary ones among
mankind with poetical power, and even the suffering
woman threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) idea into figure.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reclining position she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just
as in earlier times she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had, when standing, looked up
to a man. The animal, who was as homeless as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
respectfully withdrew a step or two when the woman
moved, and, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not repulse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
licked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand again.
A thought moved within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like lightning. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
I can make use of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) -- I might do it then!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and
the dog seemed to misunderstand: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trotted on. Then,
finding she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not follow, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came back and whined.
The ultimate and saddest singularity of woman's effort
and invention was reached when, with a quickened breath-
ing, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose to a stooping posture, and, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two
little arms upon the shoulders of the dog, leant firmly
thereon, and murmured stimulating words. Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
sorrowed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheered with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, and
what was stranger than that the strong should need
encouragement from the weak was that cheerfulness
should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend moved forward slowly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with small
mincing steps moved forward beside him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), half her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
weight being thrown upon the animal. Sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sank as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sunk from walking erect, from
the crutches, from the rails. The dog, who now
thoroughly understood her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) desire and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) incapacity,
was frantic in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) distress on these occasions; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would
tug at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress and run forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always called
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) back, and it was now to be observed that the
woman listened for human sounds only to avoid them.
It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had an object in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
presence on the road and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forlorn state unknown.
Their progress was necessarily very slow. They
reached the bottom of the town, and the Casterbridge
lamps lay before them like fallen Pleiads as they turned
to the left into the dense shade of a deserted avenue of
chestnuts, and so skirted the borough. Thus the town
was passed, and the goal was reached.
On this much-desired spot outside the town rose a
picturesque building. Originally it had been a mere
case to hold people. The shell had been so thin, so
devoid of excrescence, and so closely drawn over the
accommodation granted, that the grim character of
what was beneath showed through it, as the shape of
a body is visible under a winding-sheet.
Then Nature, as if offended, lent a hand. Masses
of ivy grew up, completely covering the walls, till the
place looked like an abbey; and it was discovered that
the view from the front, over the Casterbridge chimneys,
was one of the most magnificent in the county. A
neighbouring earl once said that he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) would give up a
year's rental to have at his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) own door the view enjoyed
by the inmates from theirs -- and very probably the
inmates would have given up the view for his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) year's
rental.
This stone edifice consisted of a central mass and
two wings, whereon stood as sentinels a few slim
chimneys, now gurgling sorrowfully to the slow wind.
In the wall was a gate, and by the gate a bellpull
formed of a hanging wire. The woman raised herself
as high as possible upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees, and could just
reach the handle. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moved it and fell forwards in
a bowed attitude, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom.
It was getting on towards six o'clock, and sounds of
movement were to be heard inside the building which
was the haven of rest to this wearied soul. A little door
by the large one was opened, and a man appeared inside.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discerned the panting heap of clothes, went back
for a light, and came again. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered a second
time, and returned with two women.
These lifted the prostrate figure and assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
through the doorway. The man then closed the door.
How did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) get here?'' said one of the women.
``The Lord knows.<div class="bookquote">'' said the other.
There is a dog outside,''  (<font color='red'><b>The Lord</b></font>)</div>murmured the overcome
traveller. <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) gone? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) helped me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stoned him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) away.'' said the man.
The little procession then moved forward -- the man
in front bearing the light, the two bony women next,
supporting between them the small and supple one.
Thus they entered the house and disappeared.




<p/>CHAPTER XLI



<p/>SUSPICION -- FANNY IS SENT FOR


<p/>BATHSHEBA said very little to her (<font color='blue'><b>FANNY</b></font>) husband all that
evening of their return from market, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not
disposed to say much to her (<font color='blue'><b>FANNY</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) exhibited the un-
pleasant combination of a restless condition with a
silent tongue. The next day, which was Sunday, passed
nearly in the same manner as regarded their taciturnity,
Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon.
This was the day before the Budmouth races. In the
evening Troy said, suddenly --
<div class="bookquote">``Bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) countenance instantly sank.'' Twenty pounds?
she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said.
``The fact is, I want it badly.'' The anxiety upon
Troy's face was unusual and very marked. lt was a
culmination of the mood he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been in all the day.
``Ah! for those races to-morrow.''
Troy for the moment made no reply. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) mistake
had its advantages to a man who shrank from having
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind inspected as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did now. ``Well, suppose I
do want it for races?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, at last.
``O, Frank!'' Bathsheba replied, and there was such
a volume of entreaty in the words. ``Only such a few
weeks ago you said that I was far sweeter than all your
other pleasures put together, and that you would give
them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this
one, which is more a worry than a pleasure? Do,
Frank. Come, let me fascinate you by all I can do
-- by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I
can think of -- to stay at home. Say yes to your wife --
say yes!''
The tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's
nature were prominent now -- advanced impulsively for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acceptance, without any of the disguises and defences
which the wariness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) character when she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was cool
too frequently threw over them. Few men could have
resisted the arch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful
face, thrown a little back and sideways in the well
known attitude that expresses more than the words it
accompanies, and which seems to have been designed
for these special occasions. Had the woman not been
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, Troy would have succumbed instantly; as it
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) longer.
``The money is not wanted for racing debts at all,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
``What is it for?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) asked. ``You worry me a great
deal by these mysterious responsibilities, Frank.''
Troy hesitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not now love her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) enough
to allow himself to be carried too far by her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) ways. Yet
it was necessary to be civil. ``You wrong me by such
a suspicious manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Such strait-waistcoating
as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a
date.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I
pay.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said, with features between a smile and a
pout.
Exactly; and, the former being done, suppose we
proceed to the latter. Bathsheba, fun is all very well,
but don't go too far, or you may have cause to regret
something.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) reddened. ``I do that already.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said, quickly
``What do you regret?''
SUSPICION
``That my romance has come to an end.''
``All romances end at marriage.''
``I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You grieve me
to my soul by being smart at my expense.''
``You are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate
me.''
``Not you -- only your faults. I do hate them.<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`Twould be much more becoming if you set your-
self to cure them. Come, let's strike a balance with
the twenty pounds, and be friends.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) gave a sigh of resignation. ``I have about that
sum here for household expenses. If you must have it,
take it.''
``Very good. Thank you. I expect I shall have
gone away before you are in to breakfast to-morrow.''
``And must you go? Ah! there was a time, Frank,
when it would have taken a good many promises to
other people to drag you away from me. You used to
call me darling, then. But it doesn't matter to you how
my days are passed now.''
``I must go, in spite of sentiment.'' Troy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
spoke, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) watch, and, apparently actuated by
NON LUCENDO principles, opened the case at the back,
revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil of hair.
Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that
moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) saw the action and saw the hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
flushed in pain and surprise, and some words escaped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had thought whether or not it was wise
to utter them. ``A woman's curl of hair!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said.
``O, Frank, whose is that?<div class="bookquote">''
Troy had instantly closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) carelessly
replied, as one who cloaked some feelings that the sight
had stirred.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>Why, yours, of course. Whose should it
be? I had quite forgotten that I had it.''
``What a dreadful fib, Frank!''
``I tell you I had forgotten it!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said, loudly.
``I don't mean that -- it was yellow hair.''
``Nonsense.''
``That's insulting me. I know it was yellow. Now
whose was it? I want to know.''
``Very well I'll tell you, so make no more ado. It
is the hair of a young woman I was going to marry
before I knew you.''
``You ought to tell me her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name, then.''
``I cannot do that.''
``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) married yet?''
``No.''
``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) alive?''
``Yes.''
``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pretty?''
``Yes.''
``It is wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can be, poor thing, under
such an awful affliction!''
``Affliction -- what affliction?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) inquired, quickly.
``Having hair of that dreadful colour.''
``Oh -- ho-i like that!'' said Troy, recovering him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)-
self. ``Why, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair has been admired by everybody
who has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has worn it loose, which has
not been long. It is beautiful hair. People used to
turn their heads to look at it, poor girl!''
``Pooh! that's nothing -- that's nothing!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) ex-
claimed, in incipient accents of pique. ``If I cared for
your love as much as I used to I could say people had
turned to look at mine.''
``Bathsheba, don't be so fitful and jealous. You
knew what married life would be like, and shouldn't
have entered it if you feared these contingencies.''
Troy had by this time driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) to bitterness: her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
heart was big in her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) throat, and the ducts to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) eyes
were painfully full. Ashamed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was to show
emotion, at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) burst out: --
``This is all I get for loving you so well! Ah! when
I married you your life was dearer to me than my own.
I would have died for you -- how truly I can say that I
would have died for you! And now you sneer at my
foolishness in marrying you. O! is it kind to me to
throw my mistake in my face? Whatever opinion you
may have of my wisdom, you should not tell me of it so
mercilessly, now that I am in your power.''
``I can't help how things fall out.'' said Troy; ``upon
my heart, women will be the death of me!''
``Well you shouldn't keep people's hair. You'll
burn it, won't you, Frank?''
Frank went on as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had not heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). ``There
are considerations even before my consideration for you;
reparations to be made -- ties you know nothing of If
you repent of marrying, so do I.''
Trembling now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arm,
saying, in mingled tones of wretchedness and coaxing,
``I only repent it if you don't love me better than any
woman in the world! I don't otherwise, Frank. You
don't repent because you already love somebody better
than you love me, do you?''
``I don't know. Why do you say that?''
``You won't burn that curl. You like the woman
who owns that pretty hair -- yes; it is pretty -- more
beautiful than my miserable black mane! Well, it is
no use; I can't help being ugly. You must like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
best, if you will!''
``Until to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have
never looked upon that bit of hair for several months --
that I am ready to swear.''
``But just now you said <div class="bookquote">``ties;''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>and then -- that
woman we met?<div class="bookquote">''
'' (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>'Twas the meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that reminded me of
the hair.''
``Is it hers, then?''
``Yes. There, now that you have wormed it out of
me, I hope you are content.''
``And what are the ties?''
``Oh! that meant nothing -- a mere jest.''
``A mere jest!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, in mournful astonishment.
``Can you jest when I am so wretchedly in earnest?
Tell me the truth, Frank. I am not a fool, you know,
although I am a woman, and have my woman's moments.
Come! treat me fairly.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, looking honestly and
fearlessly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) face. ``I don't want much; bare
justice -- that's all! Ah! once I felt I could be content
with nothing less than the highest homage from the
husband I should choose. Now, anything short of
cruelty will content me. Yes! the independent and
spirited Bathsheba is come to this!''
``For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!``Troy
said, snappishly, rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did so, and leaving the
room.
Directly he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had gone, Bathsheba burst into great
sobs -- dry-eyed sobs, which cut as they came, without
any softening by tears. But she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) determined to repress
all evidences of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was conquered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would never own it as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived. Her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pride
was indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chafed to and fro in rebelliousness, like a
caged leopard; her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole soul was in arms, and the
blood fired her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face. Until she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had met Troy, Bath-
sheba had been proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position as a woman; it
had been a glory to her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to know that her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips had been
touched by no man's on earth -- that her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) waist had
never been encircled by a lover's arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hated
herself now. In those earlier days she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had always
nourished a secret contempt for girls who were the
slaves of the first goodlooking young fellow who should
choose to salute them. She (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never taken kindly to
the idea of marriage in the abstract as did the majority
of women she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw about her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). In the turmoil of her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lover she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had agreed to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); but
the perception that had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) happiest hours
on this account was rather that of self-sacrifice than of
promotion and honour. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scarcely knew
the divinity's name, Diana was the goddess whom
Bathsheba instinctively adored. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had never,
by look, word, or sign, encouraged a man to approach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) -- that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had felt herself sufficient to herself, and
had in the independence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) girlish heart fancied
there was a certain degradation in renouncing the
simplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler
half of an indifferent matrimonial whole -- were facts
now bitterly remembered. O, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had never
stooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was, and
could only stand again, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had stood on the hill at
Norcombe, and dare Troy or any other man to pollute
a hair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interference!
The next morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) rose earlier than usual, and
had the horse saddled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) ride round the farm in
the customary way. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) came in at half-past
eight -- their usual hour for breakfasting -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was in-
formed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) husband had risen, taken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breakfast,
and driven off to Casterbridge with the gig and Poppet.
After breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was cool and collected -- quite
herself in fact -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) rambled to the gate, intending
to walk to another quarter of the farm, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) still
personally superintended as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) duties in the
house would permit, continually, however, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>)-
self preceded in forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister.
Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) sometimes thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) in the light of
an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what
life with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) as a husband would have been like; also
of life with Boldwood under the same conditions. But
Bathsheba, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) could feel, was not much given
to futile dreaming, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) musings under this head
were short and entirely confined to the times when
Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood.
It was Mr. Boldwood. Bathsheba blushed painfully,
and watched. The farmer stopped when still a long
way off, and held up his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hand to Gabriel Oak, who was
in a footpath across the field. The two men then
approached each other and seemed to engage in
earnest conversation.
Thus they continued for a long time. Joseph Poor-
grass now passed near them, wheeling a barrow of apples
up the hill to Bathsheba's residence. Boldwood and
Gabriel called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) for a few minutes,
and then all three parted, Joseph immediately coming
up the hill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) barrow.
Bathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some
surprise, experienced great relief when Boldwood turned
back again. ``Well, what's the message, Joseph?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) barrow, and, putting upon himself
the refined aspect that a conversation with a lady re-
quired, spoke to Bathsheba over the gate.
``You'll never see Fanny Robin no more -- use nor
principal -- ma'am.''
``Why?''
``Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)'s dead in the Union.''
``Fanny dead -- never!''
``Yes, ma'am.''
``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) die from?''
``I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined
to think it was from general weakness of constitution.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was such a limber maid that 'a could stand no
hardship, even when I knowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and 'a went like a
candle-snoff, so `tis said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was took bad in the
morning, and, being quite feeble and worn out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
died in the evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) belongs by law to our parish;
and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three
this afternoon to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home here and bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''
``Indeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such
thing-i shall do it! Fanny was my uncle's servant,
and, although I only knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for a couple of days,
FANNY IS SENT FOR
she (<font color='blue'><b>FANNY</b></font>) belongs to me. How very, very sad this is! --
the idea of Fanny being in a workhouse.'' Bathsheba
had begun to know what suffering was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke
with real feeling... ``Send across to Mr. Boldwood's,
and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty
of fetching an old servant of the family... We
ought not to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) in a waggon; we'll get a hearse.''
``There will hardly be time, ma'am, will there?''
``Perhaps not.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, musingly. ``When did you
say we must be at the door -- three o'clock?''
``Three o'clock this afternoon, ma'am, so to speak it.''
``Very well-you go with it. A pretty waggon is
better than an ugly hearse, after all. Joseph, have the
new spring waggon with the blue body and red wheels,
and wash it very clean. And, Joseph -- -- ''
``Yes, ma'am.''
``Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) coffin -- indeed, gather a great many, and
completely bury her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in them. Get some boughs of
laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew, and boy`siove;
ay, and some hunches of chrysanthemum. And let old

at the house of a very respectable widow-woman who
takes in work of that sort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only got handy the
Union-house on Sunday morning 'a b`lieve, and `tis sup-
posed here and there that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had traipsed every step
of the way from Melchester. Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) place,

<div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did... Ma'am, shall I call Liddy?

so pale and fainty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Certainly, ma'am.''
``Joseph, come hither a moment. What was the
colour of Fanny Robin's hair?''
``Really, mistress, now that `tis put to me so judge-
and-jury like, I can't call to mind, if ye'll believe me!''
``Never mind; go on and do what I told you. Stop
-- well no, go on.''
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned herself away from him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might no
longer notice the mood which had set its sign so visibly
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and went indoors with a distressing sense of
faintness and a beating brow. About an hour after, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a
painful consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bewildered and troubled
look. Joseph, dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) best suit of clothes, was
putting in the horse to start. The shrubs and flowers
were all piled in the waggon, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had directed
Bathsheba hardly saw them now.
``Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?''
``I don't know, ma'am.''
``Are you quite sure?''
``Yes, ma'am, quite sure.<div class="bookquote">``Sure of what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure that all I know is that she (<font color='blue'><b>sweetheart</b></font>) arrived in the
morning and died in the evening without further parley.
What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told me was only these
few words. `Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel said, looking in my face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) steady old way.
I was very sorry, and I said, `Ah! -- and how did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
come to die?<div class="bookquote">'' `Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s dead in Casterhridge
Union,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, `and perhaps `tisn't much matter
about how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came to die. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reached the Union
early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon -- that's
clear enough.<div class="bookquote">'' Then I asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d been doing
lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and
left off spitting a thistle with the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) stick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
told me about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having lived by seampstering in
Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) walked
therefrom at the end of last week, passing near here
Saturday night in the dusk. They then said I had
better just name a hint of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death to you, and away
they went. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death might have been brought on by
biding in the night wind, you know, ma'am; for people
used to say she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d go off in a decline: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used to cough
a good deal in winter time. However, `tisn't much
odds to us about that now, for `tis all over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you heard a different story at all?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so intently that Joseph's eyes quailed.
<div class="bookquote">``Not a word, mistress, I assure `ee!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Hardly anybody in the parish knows the news yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder why Gabriel didn't bring the message to
me himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mostly makes a point of seeing me
upon the most trifling errand.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These words were
merely murmured, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was looking upon the ground.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was busy, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>Joseph suggested.
``And sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) seems to suffer from things upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mind, connected with the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was better
off than 'a is now. ``A's rather a curious item, but a
very understanding shepherd, and learned in books.''
``Did anything seem upon his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) mind whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was
speaking to you about this?''
``I cannot but say that there did, ma'am. He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was
terrible down, and so was Farmer Boldwood.''
``Thank you, Joseph. That will do. Go on now,
or you'll be late.<div class="bookquote">''
Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again. In
the course of the afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to Liddy, Who had
been informed of the occurrence, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny/Fanny Robin/FANNY</b></font>)</div>What was the colour
of poor Fanny Robin's hair? Do you know? I cannot
recollect-i only saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) for a day or two.''
``It was light, ma'am; but she (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) wore it rather short,
and packed away under her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) cap, so that you would
hardly notice it. But I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) let it down when
she (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) was going to bed, and it looked beautiful then.
Real golden hair.''
``Her (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) young man was a soldier, was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not?''
``Yes. In the same regiment as Mr. Troy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) says
he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) very well.<div class="bookquote">``What, Mr. Troy says so? How came he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) to say

``Ah! Said that, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Said</b></font>)?''

Bathsheba, with the nervous petulance that comes from
worrying perceptions.




<p/>CHAPTER XLII



<p/>JOSEPH AND HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) BURDEN


<p/>A WALL bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-
house, except along a portion of the end. Here a high
gable stood prominent, and it was covered like the front
with a mat of ivy. In this gable was no window,
chimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind. The
single feature appertaining to it, beyond the expanse of
dark green leaves, was a small door.
The situation of the door was peculiar. The sill
was three or four feet above the ground, and for a
moment one was at a loss for an explanation of this
exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately beneath sug-
gested that the door was used solely for the passage of
articles and persons to and from the level of a vehicle
standing on the outside. Upon the whole, the door
seemed to advertise itself as a species of Traitor's Gate
translated to another sphere. That entry and exit
hereby was only at rare intervals became apparent on
noting that tufts of grass were allowed to flourish undis-
turbed in the chinks of the sill.
As the clock over the South-street Alms-house pointed
to five minutes to three, a blue spring waggon, picked
out with red, and containing boughs and flowers, passed
the end of the street, and up towards this side of the
building. Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out
a shattered form of <div class="bookquote">``Malbrook.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>Joseph Poorgrass rang
the bell, and received directions to back his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) waggon
against the high door under the gable. The door then
opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth,
and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the
vehicle.
One of the men then stepped up beside it, took from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) pocket a lump of chalk, and wrote upon the cover
the name and a few other words in a large scrawling
hand. -LRB-We believe that they do these things more
tenderly now, and provide a plate.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) covered the
whole with a black cloth, threadbare, but decent, the
tailboard of the waggon was returned to its place, one
of the men handed a certificate of registry to Poorgrass,
and both entered the door, closing it behind them.
Their connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>), short as it had been, was
over for ever.
Joseph then placed the flowers as enjoined, and the
evergreens around the flowers, till it was difficult to
divine what the waggon contained; he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
whip, and the rather pleasing funeral car crept down
the hill, and along the road to Weatherbury.
The afternoon drew on apace, and, looking to the
right towards the sea as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) walked beside the horse, Poor-
grass saw strange clouds and scrolls of mist rolling over
the long ridges which girt the landscape in that quarter.
They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently crept
across the intervening valleys, and around the withered
papery flags of the moor and river brinks. Then their
dank spongy forms closed in upon the sky. It was
a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had
their roots in the neighbouring sea, and by the time
that horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great
Wood, these silent workings of an invisible hand had
reached them, and they were completely enveloped,
this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs, and the
first fog of the series.
The air was as an eye suddenly struck blind. The
waggon and its load rolled no longer on the horizontal
division between clearness and opacity, but were
imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor
throughout. There was no perceptible motion in the
air, not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the
beeches, birches, and firs composing the wood on either
side. The trees stood in an attitude of intentness, as if
they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock
them. A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things
-- so completely, that the crunching of the waggon-
wheels was as a great noise, and small rustles, which
had never obtained a hearing except by night, were dis-
tinctly individualized.
Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) sad burden
as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus,
then at the unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on
each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectrelike in
their monochrome of grey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) felt anything but cheer-
ful, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) had the company even of a child or
dog. Stopping the home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) listened. Not a footstep
or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the dead
silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from
a tree through the evergreens and alighting with a smart
rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny. The fog had by
this time saturated the trees, and this was the first
dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves. The
hollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully
of the grim Leveller. Then hard by came down another
drop, then two or three. Presently there was a continual
tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the
road, and the travellers. The nearer boughs were beaded
with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and the rusty-
red leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops,
like diamonds on auburn hair.
At the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond
this wood, was the old inn Buck's Head. It was about
a mile and a half from Weatherbury, and in the meridian
times of stage-coach travelling had been the place
where many coaches changed and kept their relays
of horses. All the old stabling was now pulled down,
and little remained besides the habitable inn itself,
which, standing a little way back from the road, sig-
nified its existence to people far up and down the
highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough
of an elm on the opposite side of the way.
Travellers -- for the variety TOURIST had hardly
developed into a distinct species at this date -- some-
times said in passing, when they cast their eyes up to
the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond of repre-
senting the signboard hanging thus, but that they
themselves had never before noticed so perfect an
instance in actual working order. It was near this tree
that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak
crept on his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing
to the darkness, the sign and the inn had been un-
observed.
The manners of the inn were of the old-established
type. Indeed, in the minds of its frequenters they
existed as unalterable formulae: E.G. --
Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.
For tobacco, shout.
In calling for the girl in waiting, say, <div class="bookquote">``Maid!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>Ditto for the landlady, <div class="bookquote">``Old Soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>the landlady</b></font>)</div>etc., etc..
It was a relief to Joseph's heart when the friendly
signboard came in view, and, stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) horse
immediately beneath it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) proceeded to fulfil an
intention made a long time before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) spirits were
oozing out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) quite. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) turned the horse's head
to the green bank, and entered the hostel for a mug
of ale.
Going down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor
of which was a step below the passage, which in its
turn was a step below the road outside, what should
Joseph see to gladden his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) eyes but two copper-coloured
discs, in the form of the countenances of Mr. Jan
Coggan and Mr. Mark Clark. These owners of the
two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood,
within the pale of respectability, were now sitting face
to face over a threelegged circular table, having an
iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally
elbowed off; they might have been said to resemble
the setting sun and the full moon shining VIS-A-VIS
across the globe.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, `tis neighbour Poorgrass!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mark Clark/Mr. Clark/Mr. Mark Clark</b></font>)</div>said Mark Clark.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm sure your face don't praise your mistress's table,
Joseph.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've had a very pale companion for the last four
miles.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph, indulging in a shudder toned
down by resignation. <div class="bookquote">``And to speak the truth, 'twas
beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha'n't seed
the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast time
this morning, and that was no more than a dew-bit
afield.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then drink, Joseph, and don't restrain yourself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) a hooped mug three-
quarters full.
Joseph drank for a moderately long time, then for
a longer time, saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) lowered the jug, <div class="bookquote">''`Tis
pretty drinking -- very pretty drinking, and is more
than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to speak it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True, drink is a pleasant delight.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Jan, as one
who repeated a truism so familiar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) brain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>)
hardly noticed its passage over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) tongue; and,
lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) head gradually
backwards, with closed eyes, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) expectant soul
might not be diverted for one instant from its bliss
by irrelevant surroundings.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I must be on again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Poorgrass. <div class="bookquote">``Not
but that I should like another nip with ye; but the
parish might lose confidence in me if I was seed
here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where be ye trading o't to to-day, then, Joseph?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Back to Weatherbury. I've got poor little Fanny
Robin in my waggon outside, and I must be at the
churchyard gates at a quarter to five with her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay-i've heard of it. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)'s nailed up in
parish boards after all, and nobody to pay the bell
shilling and the grave half-crown.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The parish pays the grave half-crown, but not the
bell shilling, because the bell's a luxery: but 'a can
hardly do without the grave, poor body. However, I
expect our mistress will pay all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A pretty maid as ever I see! But what's yer hurry,
Joseph? The pore woman's dead, and you can't bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to life, and you may as well sit down comfortable,
and finish another with us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind taking just the least thimbleful ye
can dream of more with ye, sonnies. But only a few
minutes, because `tis as `tis.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Of course, you'll have another drop. A man's
twice the man afterwards. You feel so warm and
glorious, and you whop and slap at your work without
any trouble, and everything goes on like sticks a-
breaking. Too much liquor is bad, and leads us to
that horned man in the smoky house; but after all,
many people haven't the gift of enjoying a wet, and
since we be highly favoured with a power that way,
we should make the most o`t.``True.<div class="bookquote">'' said Mark Clark. '' (<font color='red'><b>the Lord</b></font>)</div>`Tis a talent the
Lord
has mercifully bestowed upon us, and we ought not
to neglect it. But, what with the parsons and clerks
and schoolpeople and serious tea-parties, the merry
old ways of good life have gone to the dogs -- upon
my carcase, they have!''
``Well, really, I must be onward again now.'' said
Joseph.
``Now, now, Joseph; nonsense! The poor woman
is dead, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and what's your hurry?''
``Well, I hope Providence won't be in a way with
me for my doings.'' said Joseph, again sitting down.
``I've been troubled with weak moments lately, `tis
true. I've been drinky once this month already, and
I did not go to church a-Sunday, and I dropped a
curse or two yesterday; so I don't want to go too far
for my safety. Your next world is your next world,
and not to be squandered offhand.''
``I believe ye to be a chapelmember, Joseph. That
I do.''
``Oh, no, no! I don't go so far as that.''
``For my part.'' said Coggan, ``I'm staunch Church
of England.''
``Ay, and faith, so be I.'' said Mark Clark.
``I won't say much for myself; I don't wish to,''
Coggan continued, with that tendency to talk on
principles which is characteristic of the barley-corn.
``But I've never changed a single doctrine: I've stuck
like a plaster to the old faith I was born in. Yes;
there's this to be said for the Church, a man can
belong to the Church and bide in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheerful old
inn, and never trouble or worry his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind about
doctrines at all. But to be a meetinger, you must
go to chapel in all winds and weathers, and make
yerself as frantic as a skit. Not but that chapel
members be clever chaps enough in their way. They
can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads, all
about their families and shipwrecks in the newspaper.''
``They can -- they can.'' said Mark Clark, with cor-
roborative feeling; ``but we Churchmen, you see, must
have it all printed aforehand, or, dang it all, we should
no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the
Lord than babes unborn,''
``Chapelfolk be more hand-in-glove with them above
than we.'' said Joseph, thoughtfully.
``Yes.'' said Coggan. ``We know very well that if
anybody do go to heaven, they will. They've worked
hard for it, and they deserve to have it, such as `tis.
I bain't such a fool as to pretend that we who stick
to the Church have the same chance as they, because
we know we have not. But I hate a feller who'll
change his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting
to heaven. I'd as soon turn king's-evidence for the
few pounds you get. Why, neighbours, when every
one of my taties were frosted, our Parson Thirdly
were the man who gave me a sack for seed, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) hardly had one for his (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>) own use, and no money to
buy 'em. If it hadn't been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Parson</b></font>), I shouldn't hae
had a tatie to put in my garden. D'ye think I'd
turn after that? No, I'll stick to my side; and if we
be in the wrong, so be it: I'll fall with the fallen!''
``Well said -- very well said.'' observed Joseph. --
``However, folks, I must be moving now: upon my life
I must. Pa`son Thirdly will be waiting at the church
gates, and there's the woman a-biding outside in the
waggon.''
``Joseph Poorgrass, don't be so miserable! Pa`son
Thirdly won't mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s a generous man; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s found
me in tracts for years, and I've consumed a good many
in the course of a long and shady life; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'s never
been the man to cry out at the expense. Sit down.''
The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>)
spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) this afternoon. The minutes glided by uncounted,
until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen,
and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points
on the surface of darkness. Coggan's repeater struck
six from his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) pocket in the usual still small tones.
At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry,
and the door opened to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak,
followed by the maid of the inn bearing a candle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces
of the sitters, which confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) with the expressions
of a fiddle and a couple of warming-pans. Joseph Poor-
grass blinked, and shrank several inches into the back-
ground.
``Upon my soul, I'm ashamed of you; `tis disgraceful,
Joseph, disgraceful!'' said Gabriel, indignantly. ``Coggan,
you call yourself a man, and don't know better than this.''
Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) eyes occasionally opening and closing of its own
accord, as if it were not a member, but a dozy individual
with a distinct personality.
``Don't take on so, shepherd!'' said Mark Clark,
looking reproachfully at the candle, which appeared
to possess special features of interest for his (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) eyes.
``Nobody can hurt a dead woman.'' at length said
Coggan, with the precision of a machine. ``All that
could be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is done -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s beyond us: and
why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for
lifeless clay that can neither feel nor see, and don't
know what you do with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all? If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'d been
alive, I would have been the first to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
now wanted victuals and drink, I'd pay for it, money
down. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s dead, and no speed of ours will
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to life. The woman's past us -- time spent
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is throwed away: why should we hurry to
do what's not required? Drink, shepherd, and be
friends, for to-morrow we may be like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''
``We may.'' added Mark Clark, emphatically, at once
drinking himself, to run no further risk of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>)
chance by the event alluded to, Jan meanwhile merging
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) additional thoughts of to-morrow in a song: --
To-mor-row, to-mor-row!
And while peace and plen-ty I find at my board,
With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row,
With my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford,
And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row.
To-mor -- row', to-mor --
``Do hold thy horning, Jan!<div class="bookquote">'' said Oak; and turning
upon Poorgrass, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jan</b></font>)</div>as for you, Joseph, who do your wicked
deeds in such confoundedly holy ways, you are as drunk
as you can stand.''
``No, Shepherd Oak, no! Listen to reason, shepherd.
All that's the matter with me is the affliction called a
multiplying eye, and that's how it is I look double to
you-i mean, you look double to me.<div class="bookquote">''
A multiplying eye is a very bad thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Mark
Clark.
<div class="bookquote">``It always comes on when I have been in a public --
house a little time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Joseph Poorgrass, meekly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; I see two of every sort, as if I were some holy
man living in the times of King Noah and entering
into the ark... Y-y-y-yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) added, becoming much
affected by the picture of himself as a person thrown
away, and shedding tears; <div class="bookquote">``I feel too good for England:
I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights, like the other
men of sacrifice, and then I shouldn't have b-b-been
called a d-d-drunkard in such a way!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd show yourself a man of spirit, and not
sit whining there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Show myself a man of spirit? ... Ah, well! let
me take the name of drunkard humbly-iet me be a
man of contrite knees-iet it be! l know that I always
do say ``Please God<div class="bookquote">'' afore I do anything, from my
getting up to my going down of the same, and I be
willing to take as much disgrace as there is in that
holy act. Hah, yes! ... But not a man of spirit?
Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted
against my hinder parts without groaning manfully that
I question the right to do so? I inquire that query
boldly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We can't say that you have, Hero Poorgrass,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>admitted Jan.
<div class="bookquote">``Never have I allowed such treatment to pass un-
questioned! Yet the shepherd says in the face of that
rich testimony that I be not a man of spirit! Well,
let it pass by, and death is a kind friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel, seeing that neither of the three was in a fit
state to Cake charge of the waggon for the remainder of
the journey, made no reply, but, closing the door again
upon them, went across to where the vehicle stood, now
getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pulled the horse's head from the large patch
of turf it had eaten bare, readjusted the boughs over
the coffin, and drove along through the unwholesome
night.
It had gradually become rumoured in the village
that the body to be brought and buried that day was
all that was left of the unfortunate Fanny Robin who
had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through
Melchester and onwards. But, thanks to Boldwood's
reticence and Oak's generosity, the lover she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) had followed
had never been individualized as Troy. Gabriel hoped
that the whole truth of the matter might not be published
till at any rate the girl had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grave for a few
days, when the interposing barriers of earth and time,
and a sense that the events had been somewhat shut
into oblivion, would deaden the sting that revelation and
invidious remark would have for Bathsheba just now.
By the time that Gabriel reached the old manor-
house, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) residence, which lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) way to the church,
it was quite dark. A man came from the gate and said
through the fog, which hung between them like blown
flour --
<div class="bookquote">``Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?''
 (<font color='red'><b>A man</b></font>)</div>Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.
<div class="bookquote">``The corpse is here, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<div class="bookquote">``I have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could
tell me the reason of the delay. I am afraid it is too
late now for the funeral to be performed with proper
decency. Have you the registrar's certificate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``I expect Poorgrass has that;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>)'s at the Buck's Head. I forgot to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>)
for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then that settles the matter. We'll put off the
funeral till to-morrow morning. The body may be
brought on to the church, or it may be left here at
the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning.
They waited more than an hour, and have now gone
home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel had his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) reasons for thinking the latter a
most objectionable plan, notwithstanding that Fanny
had been an inmate of the farm-house for several years
in the lifetime of Bathsheba's uncle. Visions of several
unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay
flitted before him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will was not law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
went indoors to inquire of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mistress what were her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
wishes on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in an unusual
mood: her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were suspicious
and perplexed as with some antecedent thought. Troy
had not yet returned. At first Bathsheba assented with
a mien of indifference to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) proposition that they should
go on to the church at once with their burden; but
immediately afterwards, following Gabriel to the gate,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny's
account, and desired that the girl might be brought into
the house. Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the waggon, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay now, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flowers
and green leaves about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), merely wheeling the vehicle
into the coach-house till the morning, but to no purpose,
<div class="bookquote">``It is unkind and unchristian.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to leave the
poor thing in a coach-house all night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Very well, then.'' said the parson. ``And I will
arrange that the funeral shall take place early to-
morrow. Perhaps Mrs. Troy is right in feeling that we
cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too thoughtfully
We must remember that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) may have erred
grievously in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is still our sister:
and it is to be believed that God's uncovenanted
mercies are extended towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) is a
member of the flock of Christ.<div class="bookquote">''
The parson's words spread into the heavy air with a
sad yet unperturbed cadence, and Gabriel shed an
honest tear. Bathsheba seemed unmoved. Mr.
Thirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted a lantern.
Fetching three other men to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), they bore the
unconscious truant indoors, placing the coffin on two
benches in the middle of a little sitting-room next the
hall, as Bathsheba directed.
Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) still indecisively lingered beside the body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was
deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical aspect that
circumstances were putting on with regard to Troy's
wife, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) own powerlessness to counteract them,
-LRB-n spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) careful manoeuvring all this day, the very
worst event that could in any way have happened in
connection with the burial had happened now. Oak
imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this after-
noon's work that might cast over Bathsheba's life a shade
which the interposition of many lapsing years might but
indifferently lighten, and which nothing at all might
altogether remove.
Suddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba
from, at any rate, immediate anguish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) looked again,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had looked before, at the chalk writing upon the
coffinlid. The scrawl was this simple one, ''  (<font color='red'><b>Christ</b></font>)</div>Fanny
Robin and child.'' Gabriel took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) handkerchief and
carefully rubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible
the inscription <div class="bookquote">``Fanny Robin''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>only. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) then left the
room, and went out quietly by the front door.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIII



<p/>FANNY``S REVENGE


<p/><div class="bookquote">``DO you want me any longer ma'am? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>inquired Liddy,
at a later hour the same evening, standing by the door
with a chamber candlestick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) hand and addressing
Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the large
parlour beside the first fire of the season.
<div class="bookquote">``No more to-night, Liddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am. I am not
at all afraid of Fanny, if I may sit in my own room and
have a candle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was such a childlike, nesh young
thing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirit couldn't appear to anybody if it
tried, I'm quite sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, no! You go to bed. I'll sit up for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
myself till twelve o'clock, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has not arrived by
that time, I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) up and go to bed too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It is half-past ten now.''
``Oh! is it?<div class="bookquote">''
Why don't you sit upstairs, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, desultorily. <div class="bookquote">``It
isn't worth while -- there's a fire here, Liddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)
suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited whisper,
Have you heard anything strange said of Fanny?''
The words had no sooner escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than an expres-
sion of unutterable regret crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
burst into tears.
``No -- not a word!'' said Liddy, looking at the
weeping woman with astonishment. ``What is it makes
you cry so, ma'am; has anything hurt you?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came
to Bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy.
``No, Liddy-i don't want you any more. I can
hardly say why I have taken to crying lately: I never
used to cry. Good-night.<div class="bookquote">''
Liddy then left the parlour and closed the door.
Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lone-
lier actually than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) marriage;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loneliness then was to that of the present time
as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a
cave. And within the last day or two had come these
disquieting thoughts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband's past. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wayward sentiment that evening concerning Fanny's
temporary resting-place had been the result of a strange
complication of impulses in Bathsheba's bosom. Per-
haps it would be more accurately described as a
determined rebellion against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prejudices, a revulsion
from a lower instinct of uncharitableness, which would
have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman, be-
cause in life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had preceded Bathsheba in the atten-
tions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means
ceased from loving, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love was sick to death
just now with the gravity of a further misgiving.
In five or ten minutes there was another tap at the
door. Liddy reappeared, and coming in a little way
stood hesitating, until at length she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said,!Maryann has
just heard something very strange, but I know it isn't
true. And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in
a day or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing connected with you or us, ma'am. It
is about Fanny. That same thing you have heard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have heard nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury
within this last hour -- that -- --''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy came close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) mistress and whispered the remainder of the sentence
slowly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) ear, inclining her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) spoke in
the direction of the room where Fanny lay.
Bathsheba trembled from head to foot.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``And
there's only one name written on the coffin-cover.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nor I, ma'am. And a good many others don't;
for we should surely have been told more about it if it
had been true -- don't you think so, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We might or we might not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that
Liddy might not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face. Finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistress
was going to say no more, Liddy glided out, closed the
door softly, and went to bed.
Bathsheba's face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued looking into the
fire that evening, might have excited solicitousness on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) account even among those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) least.
The sadness of Fanny Robin's fate did not make Bath-
sheba's glorious, although she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) was the Esther to this
poor Vashti, and their fates might be supposed to stand
in some respects as contrasts to each other. When
Liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful
eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary look-
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) went out after telling the story they had ex-
pressed wretchedness in full activity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Esther</b></font>) simple
country nature, fed on old-fashioned principles, was
troubled by that which would have troubled a woman
of the world very little, both Fanny and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had one, being dead.
Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own history and the dimly suspected
tragedy of Fanny's end which Oak and Boldwood never
for a moment credited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with possessing. The
meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday
night had been unwitnessed and unspoken of. Oak
may have had the best of intentions in withholding for
as many days as possible the details of what had
happened to Fanny; but had he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) known that Bathsheba's
perceptions had already been exercised in the matter,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of
suspense she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now undergoing, when the certainty
which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected
after all.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some
one stronger than herself, and so get strength to sustain
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) surmised position with dignity and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lurking
doubts with stoicism. Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) find such a
friend? nowhere in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was by far the
coolest of the women under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) roof. Patience and
suspension of judgement for a few hours were what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wanted to learn, and there was nobody to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
Might she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) but go to Gabriel Oak! -- but that could not
be. What a way Oak had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought, of enduring
things. Boldwood, who seemed so much deeper and
higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel, had not
yet learnt, any more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) herself, the simple
lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn
and look he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) gave -- that among the multitude of interests
by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was surrounded, those which affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and
important in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) eyes. Oak meditatively looked upon
the horizon of circumstances without any special regard
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) own standpoint in the midst. That was how
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would wish to be. But then Oak was not racked
by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) bosom, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was at this moment. Oak knew all about Fanny
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) wished to know -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt convinced of that.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) were to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) now at once and say no more
than these few words,!What is the truth of the story?''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would feel bound in honour to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). It would
be an inexpressible relief. No further speech would
need to be uttered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so well that no
eccentricity of behaviour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) flung a cloak round her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), went to the door and
opened it. Every blade, every twig was still. The air
was yet thick with moisture, though somewhat less dense
than during the afternoon, and a steady smack of drops
upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost
musical in its soothing regularity. lt seemed better to
be out of the house than within it, and Bathsheba closed
the door, and walked slowly down the lane till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came
opposite to Gabriel's cottage, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) now lived alone,
having left Coggan's house through being pinched for
room. There was a light in one window only', and that
was downstairs. The shutters were not closed, nor was
any blind or curtain drawn over the window, neither
robbery nor observation being a contingency which could
do much injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes,
it was Gabriel himself who was sitting up: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was reading,
From her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) standing-place in the road she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
plainly, sitting quite still, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) light curly head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
hand, and only occasionally looking up to snuff the
candle which stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) looked
at the clock, seemed surprised at the lateness of the
hour, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) book, and arose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was going to bed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tapped it must be done at once.
Alas for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolve! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not do it,
Not for worlds now could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) give a hint about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), much less ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) plainly for information
on the cause of Fanny's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must suspect, and
guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.
Like a homeless wanderer she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lingered by the bank,
as if lulled and fascinated by the atmosphere of content
which seemed to spread from that little dwelling, and
was so sadly lacking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own. Gabriel appeared in
an upper room, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) light in the window-bench,
and then -- knelt down to pray. The contrast of the
picture with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rebellious and agitated existence at this
same time was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to bear to look upon
longer. It was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to make a truce with
trouble by any such means. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must tread her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) giddy
distracting measure to its last note, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had begun it.
With a swollen heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went again up the lane, and
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own door.
More fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings
which Oak's example had raised in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paused in
the hall, looking at the door of the room wherein Fanny
lay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fingers, threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, and
strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hot hands rigidly across her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forehead, saying,
with a hysterical sob, ``Would to God you would speak
and tell me your secret, Fanny! . , . O, I hope, hope
it is not true that there are two of you! ... If I could
only look in upon you for one little minute, I should
know all!''
A few moments passed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, slowly, ``And
I will''
Bathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood
which carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) through the actions following this
murmured resolution on this memorable evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to the lumber-closet for a screw-driver.
At the end of a short though undefined time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found
herself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
brain, standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl
whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
saying to herself in a husky voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gazed within --
``It was best to know the worst, and I know it now!''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was conscious of having brought about this
situation by a series of actions done as by one in an
extravagant dream; of following that idea as to method,
which had burst upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the hall with glaring
obviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs, assuring
herself by listening to the heavy breathing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) maids
that they were asleep, gliding down again, turning the
handle of the door within which the young girl lay, and
deliberately setting herself to do what, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had antici-
pated any such undertaking at night and alone, would
have horrified her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but which, when done, was not so
dreadful as was the conclusive proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband's
conduct which came with knowing beyond doubt the
last chapter of Fanny's story.
Bathsheba's head sank upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bosom, and the
breath which had been bated in suspense, curiosity, and
interest, was exhaled now in the form of a whispered
wail: ``Oh-h-h!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, and the silent room added
length to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) moan.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the
coffin: tears of a complicated origin, of a nature inde-
scribable, almost indefinable except as other than those
of simple sorrow. Assuredly their wonted fires must
have lived in Fanny's ashes when events were so shaped
as to chariot her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet
effectual manner. The one feat alone -- that of dying --
by which a mean condition could be resolved into a
grand one, Fanny had achieved. And to that had
destiny subjoined this rencounter to-night, which had,
in Bathsheba's wild imagining, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion's
failure to success, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) humiliation to triumph, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) luck-
lessness to ascendency; et had thrown over herself a
garish light of mockery, and set upon all things about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an ironical smile.
Fanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of
hers; and there was no longer much room for doubt as
to the origin of the curl owned by Troy. In Bath-
sheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance
expressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was retaliating for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pain with all the merciless
rigour of the Mosaic law: ``Burning for burning; wound
for wound: strife for strife.
Bathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) position by immediate death, which thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
though it was an inconvenient and awful way, had limits
to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not be
overpassed; whilst the shames of life were measureless.
Yet even this scheme of extinction by death was out
tamely copying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rival's method without the reasons
which had glorified it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rival's case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) glided
rapidly up and down the room, as was mostly her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) habit
hen excited, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hands hanging clasped in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought and in part expressed in broken words:
O, I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), yet I don't mean that I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), for
it is grievous and wicked; and yet I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a little!
yes, my flesh insists upon hating her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), whether my spirit
is willing or no!... If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had only lived, I could
ave been angry and cruel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with some justifi-
cation; but to be vindictive towards a poor dead woman
recoils upon myself. O God, have mercy,! I am
miserable at all this!''
Bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own state of mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked around for some sort
of refuge from herself. The vision of Oak kneeling
down that night recurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and with the imitative
instinct which animates women she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seized upon the idea,
resolved to kneel, and, if possible, pray. Gabriel had
prayed; so would she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knelt beside the coffin, covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
hands, and for a time the room was silent as a tomb.
whether from a purely mechanical, or from any other
cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted spirit,
and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had
seized upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) just before.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desire to make atonement she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) took flowers
from a vase by the window, and began laying them
around the dead girl's head. Bathsheba knew no other
way of showing kindness to persons departed than by
giving them flowers. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew not how long she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
remained engaged thus. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forgot time, life, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was doing. A slamming together of
the coach-house doors in the yard brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)-
self again. An instant after, the front door opened and
closed, steps crossed the hall, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband appeared
at the entrance to the room, looking in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at
the scene, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought it an illusion raised by some
fiendish
incantation. Bathsheba, pallid as a corpse on
end, gazed back at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the same wild way.
So little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate
induction, that at this moment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood with the
door in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, Troy never once thought of Fanny in
connection with what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first confused idea
was that somebody in the house had died.
``Well -- what?'' said Troy, blankly.
``I must go! I must go!'' said Bathsheba, to herself
more than to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) came with a dilated eye towards
the door, to push past him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
``What's the matter, in God's name? who's dead?''
said Troy.
``I cannot say; let me go out. I want air!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
continued.
``But no; stay, I insist!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and
then volition seemed to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went off into
a state of passivity. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), came up the
room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and Bathsheba
approached the coffin's side.
The candle was standing on a bureau close by them,
and the light slanted down, distinctly enkindling the
cold features of both mother and babe. Troy looked
in, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's hand, knowledge of it all came
over him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in a lurid sheen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood still.
So still he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) remained that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could be imagined to
have left in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no motive power whatever. The
clashes of feeling in all directions confounded one
another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion in
none.
``Do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'' said Bathsheba, in a small
enclosed echo, as from the interior of a cell.
``I do.'' said Troy.
``Is it she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''
``It is.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had originally stood perfectly erect. And now,
in the wellnigh congealed immobility of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frame
could be discerned an incipient movement, as in the
darkest night may be discerned light after a while.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was gradually sinking forwards. The lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
features softened, and dismay modulated to illimitable
sadness. Bathsheba was regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from the other
side, still with parted lips and distracted eyes. Capacity
for intense feeling is proportionate to the general
intensity of the nature ,and perhaps in all Fanny's
sufferings, much greater relatively to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) strength, there
never was a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suffered in an absolute sense
what Bathsheba suffered now.
What Troy did was to sink upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knees with
an indefinable union of remorse and reverence upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, and, bending over Fanny Robin, gently kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>), as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid
awakening it.
At the sight and sound of that, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>), unendurable
act, Bathsheba sprang towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). All the strong
feelings which had been scattered over her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) existence
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) knew what feeling was, seemed gathered
together into one pulsation now. The revulsion from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) indignant mood a little earlier, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) had
meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment,
eclipse in maternity by another, was violent and entire.
All that was forgotten in the simple and still strong
attachment of wife to husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had sighed for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) self-completeness then, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried aloud
against the severance of the union she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had deplored.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms round Troy's neck, exclaiming wildly
from the deepest deep of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart --
``Don't -- don't kiss them! O, Frank, I can<div class="bookquote">``t bear
it-i can't! I love you better than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did: kiss me
too, Frank -- kiss me! You will, Frank, kiss me too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was something so abnormal and startling in
the childlike pain and simplicity of this appeal from a
woman of Bathsheba's calibre and independence, that
Troy, loosening her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tightly clasped arms from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neck,
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in bewilderment. It was such and unex-
pected revelation of all women being alike at heart, even
those so different in their accessories as Fanny and this
one beside him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), that Troy could hardly seem to believe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) proud wife Bathsheba. Fanny's own
spirit seemed to be animating her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) frame. But this was
the mood of a few instants only. When the momentary
<div class="bookquote">``I will not kiss you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) away.
Had the wife now but gone no further. Yet,
perhaps. under the harrowing circumstances, to speak
out was the one wrong act which can be better under-
stood, if not forgiven in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), than the right and politic
one, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rival being now but a corpse. All the feeling
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been betrayed into showing she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) drew back to
herself again by a strenuous effort of self-command.
<div class="bookquote">``What have you to say as your reason?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bitter voice being strangely low -- quite that of
another woman now.
<div class="bookquote">``I have to say that I have been a bad, black-hearted
man.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered.
less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).''
``Ah! don't taunt me, madam. This woman is more
to me, dead as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is, than ever you were, or are, or can
be. If Satan had not tempted me with that face of
yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have
He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) turned to Fanny then. <div class="bookquote">``But never mind, darling,
wife!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>At these words there arose from Bathsheba's lips a
long, low cry of measureless despair and indignation,
such a wail of anguish as had never before been heard
within those old-inhabited walls. It was the product*
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) union with Troy.
<div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s -- that, -- what -- am I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, as a
continuation of the same cry, and sobbing pitifully:
and the rarity with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of such abandonment only made
the condition more dire.
<div class="bookquote">``You are nothing to me -- nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy,
heartlessly. <div class="bookquote">``A ceremony before a priest doesn't make
a marriage. I am not morally yours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A vehement impulse to flee from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), to run from
this place, hide, and escape his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) words at any price, not
stopping short of death itself, mastered Bathsheba now.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) waited not an instant, but turned to the door and
ran out.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIV



<p/>UNDER A TREE -- REACTION


<p/>BATHSHEBA went along the dark road, neither know-
ing nor caring about the direction or issue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) flight.
The first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) definitely noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) position
was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reached a gate leading into a thicket over-
hung by some large oak and beech trees. On looking
into the place, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen it
by daylight on some previous occasion, and that what
appeared like an impassable thicket was in reality a
brake of fern now withering fast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of
nothing better to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) palpitating self than to go
in here and hide; and entering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lighted on a spot
sheltered from the damp fog by a reclining trunk, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sank down upon a tangled couch of fronds and
stems. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mechanically pulled some armfuls round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to keep off the breezes, and closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes.
Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) slept or not that night Bathsheba was
not clearly aware. But it was with a freshened exist-
ence and a cooler brain that, a long time afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
became conscious of some interesting proceedings which
were going on in the trees above her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head and around.
A coarse-throated chatter was the first sound.
It was a sparrow just waking.
Next: <div class="bookquote">``Chee-weeze-weeze-weeze!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from another
retreat.
It was a finch.
Third: <div class="bookquote">``Tink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink!''  (<font color='red'><b>a robin</b></font>)</div>from the hedge,
It was a robin.
<div class="bookquote">``Chuck-chuck-chuck!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>overhead.
A squirrel.
Then, from the road, <div class="bookquote">``With my ra-ta-ta, and my
rum-tum-tum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was a ploughboy. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) came opposite,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed from his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) voice that he (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was one of
the boys on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own farm. He (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) was followed by a
shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through
the ferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light
of daybreak a team of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own horses. They stopped
to drink at a pond on the other side of the way'. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
watched them flouncing into the pool, drinking, tossing
up their heads, drinking again, the water dribbling
from their lips in silver threads. There was another
flounce, and they came out of the pond, and turned
back again towards the farm.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked further around. Day was just dawning,
and beside its cool air and colours her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heated actions
and resolves of the night stood out in lurid contrast.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) perceived that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lap, and clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
hair, were red and yellow leaves which had come
down from the tree and settled silently upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
during her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) partial sleep. Bathsheba shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dress to
get rid of them, when multitudes of the same family lying
round about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rose and fluttered away in the breeze
thus created, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.''
There was an opening towards the east, and the
glow from the as yet unrisen sun attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes
thither. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feet, and between the beautiful
yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground
sloped downwards to a hollow, in which was a species
of swamp, dotted with fungi. A morning mist hung
over it now -- a fulsome yet magnificent silvery veil,
full of light from the sun, yet semi-opaque -- the hedge
behind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy
luminousness. Up the sides of this depression grew
sheaves of the common rush, and here and there a
peculiar species of flag, the blades of which glistened
in the emerging sun, like scythes. But the general
aspect of the swamp was malignant. From its moist
and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the essences
of evil things in the earth, and in the waters under
the earth. The fungi grew in all manner of positions
from rotting leaves and tree stumps, some exhibiting
to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) listless gaze their clammy tops, others their
oozing gills. Some were marked with great splotches,
red as arterial blood, others were saffron yellow, and
others tall and attenuated, with stems like macaroni.
Some were leathery and of richest browns. The
hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and
great, in the immediate neighbourhood of comfort
and health, and Bathsheba arose with a tremor at the
thought of having passed the night on the brink of
so dismal a place.
``There were now other footsteps to be heard along
the road. Bathsheba's nerves were still unstrung:
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crouched down out of sight again, and the pedes-
trian came into view. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a schoolboy, with a
bag slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shoulder containing his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) dinner,
and a hook in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) paused by the gate,
and, without looking up, continued murmuring words
in tones quite loud enough to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ears.
<div class="bookquote">``O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>: --
that I know out o' book. <div class="bookquote">``Give us, give us, give us,
give us, give us'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>: -- that I know. <div class="bookquote">``Grace that, grace that,
grace that, grace that'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>: -- that I know.'' Other words
followed to the same effect. The boy was of the
dunce class apparently; the book was a psalter, and
this was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way of learning the collect. In the worst
attacks of trouble there appears to be always a super-
ficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged
and open to the notice of trifles, and Bathsheba was
faintly amused at the boy's method, till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too passed on.
By this time stupor had given place to anxiety, and
anxiety began to make room for hunger and thirst.
A form now appeared upon the rise on the other side
of the swamp, half-hidden by the mist, and came
towards Bathsheba. The woman -- for it was a woman
-- approached with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face askance, as if looking
earnestly on all sides of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got a little
further round to the left, and drew nearer, Bathsheba
could see the newcomer's profile against the sunny
sky', and knew the wavy sweep from forehead to chin,
with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere about
it, to be the familiar contour of Liddy Smallbury.
Bathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in the
thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not altogether deserted, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
jumped up. ``O, Liddy!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, or attempted to say;
but the words had only been framed by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips; there
came no sound. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice by exposure
to the clogged atmosphere all these hours of night.
``O, ma'am! I am so glad I have found you.'' said
the girl, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw Bathsheba.
``You can't come across.'' Bathsheba said in a whisper,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to
reach Liddy's ears. Liddy, not knowing this, stepped
down upon the swamp, saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did so, ``It will
bear me up, I think.''
Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture
of Liddy crossing the swamp to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) there in the
morning light. Iridescent bubbles of dank subter-
ranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the
waiting maid's feet as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) trod, hissing as they burst
and expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above.
Liddy did not sink, as Bathsheba had anticipated.
She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) landed safely on the other side, and looked up
at the beautiful though pale and weary face of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
young mistress.
``Poor thing!<div class="bookquote">'' said Liddy, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eyes,
Do hearten yourself up a little, ma'am. However

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't speak above a whisper -- my voice is gone
for the present.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, hurriedly.<div class="bookquote">'' I suppose
the damp air from that hollow has taken it away
Liddy, don't question me, mind. Who sent you --
anybody?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nobody. I thought, when I found you were not
at home, that something cruel had happened. I fancy
I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) voice late last night; and so, knowing

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) at home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) left just before I came out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Fanny taken away?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will soon be -- at nine o'clock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``we won't go home at present, then. Suppose we
walk about in this wood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy, without exactly understanding everything, or
anything, in this episode, assented, and they walked
together further among the trees.
<div class="bookquote">``But you had better come in, ma'am, and have
something to eat. You will die of a chill!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall not come indoors yet -- perhaps never.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shall I get you something to eat, and something
else to put over your head besides that little shawl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you will, Liddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy vanished, and at the end of twenty minutes
returned with a cloak, hat, some slices of bread and
butter, a tea-cup, and some hot tea in a little china jug
<div class="bookquote">``Is Fanny gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) companion, pouring out the tea.
Bathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank
sparingly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) voice was then a little clearer, and
trifling colour returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Now we'll walk
about again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) said.
They wandered about the wood for nearly two
hours, Bathsheba replying in monosyllables to Liddy's
prattle, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) mind ran on one subject, and one only.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) interrupted with --
<div class="bookquote">``l wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will go and see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) came back with the information that the
men were just taking away the corpse; that Bathsheba
had been inquired for; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) had replied to the
effect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) mistress was unwell and could not be
seen.
<div class="bookquote">``Then they think I am in my bedroom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Liddy then ventured to add:<div class="bookquote">'' You said
when I first found you that you might never go home
again -- you didn't mean it, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No; I've altered my mind. It is only women with
no pride in them who run away from their husbands.
There is one position worse than that of being found
dead in your husband's house from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ill usage, and
that is, to be found alive through having gone away to
The house of somebody else. I've thought of it all this
morning, and I've chosen my course. A runaway wife
is an encumbrance to everybody, a burden to herself and
a byword -- all of which make up a heap of misery
greater than any that comes by staying at home --
though this may include the trifling items of insult,
beating, and starvation. Liddy, if ever you marry --
God forbid that you ever should! -- you'll find yourself
in a fearful situation; but mind this, don't you flinch.
Stand your ground, and be cut to pieces. That's
what I'm going to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, mistress, don't talk so!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Liddy,-taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
hand; <div class="bookquote">``but I knew you had too much sense to bide
away. May I ask what dreadful thing it is that has
happened between you and him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You may ask; but I may not tell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In about ten minutes they returned to the house by
a circuitous route, entering at the rear. Bathsheba
glided up the back stairs to a disused attic, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)
companion followed.
<div class="bookquote">``Liddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) said, with a lighter heart, for youth and

my confidante for the present -- somebody must be -- and
I choose you. Well, I shall take up my abode here for

Afterwards, I want you and Maryann to bring up that

 (<font color='red'><b>youth hope</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said
Liddy.

Liddy, I'll read. Bring up some books -- not new ones.
I haven't heart to read anything new.''
``Some of your uncle's old ones, ma'am?''
``Yes. Some of those we stowed away in boxes.'' A
faint gleam of humour passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maryann</b></font>) said:
``Bring Beaumont and Fletcher's Maid's Tragedy, and
the Mourning Bride, and let me see -- Night Thoughts,
and the Vanity of Human Wishes.''
``And that story of the black man, who murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife Desdemona? It is a nice dismal one that would
suit you excellent just now.''
``Now, Liddy, you've been looking into my book
without telling me; and I said you were not to! How
do you know it would suit me? It wouldn't suit me a
all.''
``But if the others do -- -- ''
``No, they don't; and I won't read dismal books.
Why should I read dismal books, indeed? Bring me
Love in a Village, and Maid of the Mill, and Doctor
Syntax, and some volumes of the Spectator.''
All that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic
in a state of barricade; a precaution which proved to be
needless as against Troy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) did not appear in the
neighbourhood or trouble them at all. Bathsheba sat
at the window till sunset, sometimes attempting to read,
at other times watching every movement outside without
much purpose, and listening without much interest to
every sound.
The sun went down almost blood-red that night, and
a livid cloud received its rays in the east. Up against
this dark background the west front of the church
tower -- the only part of the edifice visible from the
farm-house windows -- rose distinct and lustrous, the
vane upon the summit bristling with rays. Hereabouts,
at six o'clock, the young men of the village gathered,
as was their custom, for a game of Prisoners' base. The
spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from
time immemorial, the old stocks conveniently forming
a base facing the boundary of the churchyard, in front
of which the ground was trodden hard and bare as a
pavement by the players. She (<font color='blue'><b>players</b></font>) could see the brown
and black heads of the young lads darting about right
and left, their white shirt-sleeves gleaming in the sun;
whilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter
varied the stillness of the evening air. They continued
playing for a quarter of an hour or so, when the game
concluded abruptly, and the players leapt over the wall
and vanished round to the other side behind a yew-tree,
which was also half behind a beech, now spreading in
one mass of golden foliage, on which the branches
traced black lines.
``Why did the base-players finish their game so
suddenly?'' Bathsheba inquired, the next time that
Liddy entered the room.
``I think 'twas because two men came just then from
Casterbridge and began putting up grand carved
tombstone.'' said Liddy. ``The lads went to see whose
it was.''
``Do you know?'' Bathsheba asked.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Liddy.




<p/>CHAPTER XLV



<p/>TROY``S ROMANTICISM


<p/>WHEN Troy's wife had left the house at the previous
midnight his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) first act was to cover the dead from sight.
This done he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ascended the stairs, and throwing himself
down upon the bed dressed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) waited miser-
ably for the morning.
Fate had dealt grimly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) through the last four-
and-twenty hours. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) day had been spent in a way
which varied very materially from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) intentions regard-
ing it. There is always an inertia to be overcome in
striking out a new line of conduct -- not more in our-
selves, it seems, than in circumscribing events, which
appear as if leagued together to allow no novelties in
the way of amelioration.
Twenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had managed to add to the sum every farthing he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
could muster on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own account, which had been seven
pounds ten. With this money, twenty-seven pounds ten
in all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had hastily driven from the gate that morning
to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) appointment with Fanny Robin.
On reaching Casterbridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) left the horse and trap
at an inn, and at five minutes before ten came back to
the bridge at the lower end of the town, and sat himself
upon the parapet. The clocks struck the hour, and no
Fanny appeared. In fact, at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was being
robed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) grave-clothes by two attendants at the
Union poorhouse -- the first and last tiring-women the
gentle creature had ever been honoured with. The
quarter went, the half hour. A rush of recollection
came upon Troy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) waited: this was the second
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had broken a serious engagement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
In anger he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vowed it should be the last, and at eleven
o'clock, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had lingered and watched the stone
of the bridge till he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knew every lichen upon their face
and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they
oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) jumped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) seat, went to the inn
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) gig, and in a bitter mood of indifference con-
cerning the past, and recklessness about the future,
drove on to Budmouth races.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) reached the race-course at two o'clock, and re-
mained either there or in the town till nine, But
Fanny's image, as it had appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in the sombre
shadows of that Saturday evening, returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind,
backed up by Bathsheba's reproaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
would not bet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) vow, for on leaving the
town at nine o'clock in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had diminish
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cash only to the extent of a few shillings.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) trotted slowly homeward, and it was now that
was struck for the first time with a thought that Fanny
had been really prevented by illness from keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
promise. This time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have made no mistake
He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not remained in Casterbridge
and made inquiries. Reaching home he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) quietly un-
harnessed the horse and came indoors, as we have seen,
to the fearful shock that awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
As soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects,
Troy arose from the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood
of absolute indifference to Bathsheba's whereabouts, a
almost oblivious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) existence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stalked downstairs
and left the house by the back door. His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) walk was
towards the churchyard, entering which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) searched
around till he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) found a newly dug unoccupied grave --
the grave dug the day before for Fanny. The position
of this having been marked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hastened on to Caster-
bridge, only pausing
whereon he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had last seen Fanny alive.
Reaching the town, Troy descended into a side
street and entered a pair of gates surmounted by a board
bearing the words, <div class="bookquote">``Lester, stone and marble mason.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div>Within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs,
inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed
persons who had not yet died.
Troy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and
deed, that the want of likeness was perceptible even to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) own consciousness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) method of engaging himself
in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of an
absolutely unpractised man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)-
self to consider, calculate, or economize. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waywardly
wished for something, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set about obtaining it like
a child in a nursery. <div class="bookquote">``I want a good tomb.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to
the man who stood in a little office within the yard.
<div class="bookquote">``I want as good a one as you can give me for twenty-
seven pounds,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was all the money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed.
<div class="bookquote">``That sum to include everything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Everything. Cutting the name, carriage to Weather-
bury, and erection. And I want it now at once .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``We could not get anything special worked this
week.
``If you would like one of these in stock it could be
got ready immediately.''
``Very well.'' said Troy, impatiently. ``Let's see what
you have.''
``The best I have in stock is this one,<div class="bookquote">'' said the stone-
cutter, going into a shed.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Here's a marble headstone
beautifully crocketed, with medallions beneath of typical

settled the account and went away. In the afternoon

extent from the view of passers along the road -- a spot
and bushes of alder, but now it was cleared and made
the ground elsewhere.
Here now stood the tomb as the men had stated, snow-
white and shapely in the gloom, consisting of head and
foot-stone, and enclosing border of marble-work uniting
them. In the midst was mould, suitable for plants.
Troy deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) basket beside the tomb, and
vanished for a few minutes. When he (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) returned he (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>)
carried a spade and a lantern, the light of which he (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>)
directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst he (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>)
read the inscription. He (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) hung his (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) lantern on the lowest
bough of the yew-tree, and took from his (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) basket flower-
roots of several varieties. There were bundles of snow-
drop, hyacinth and crocus bulbs, violets and double
daisies, which were to bloom in early spring, and of
carnations, pinks, picotees, lilies of the valley, forget-me-
not, summer's-farewell, meadow-saffron and others, for
the later seasons of the year.
Troy laid these out upon the grass, and with an im-
passive face set to work to plant them. The snowdrops
were arranged in a line on the outside of the coping,
the remainder within the enclosure of the grave. The
crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows; some of
the summer flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) placed over her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) head and feet,
the lilies and forget-me-nots over her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heart. The
remainder were dispersed in the spaces between these.
Troy, in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) prostration at this time, had no percep-
tion that in the futility of these romantic doings, dictated
by a remorseful reaction from previous indifference, there
was any element of absurdity. Deriving his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) idiosyn-
crasies from both sides of the Channel, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) showed at
such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the
Englishman, together with that blindness to the line
where sentiment verges on mawkishness, characteristic
of the French.
lt was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and
the rays from Troy's lantern spread into the two old
yews with a strange illuminating power, flickering, as it
seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud above. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)
felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) hand, and
presently one came and entered one of the holes of the
lantern, whereupon the candle sputtered and went out-
Troy was weary and it being now not far from midnight,
and the rain threatening to increase, he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) resolved to leave
the finishing touches of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) labour until the day should
break. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) groped along the wall and over the graves
in the dark till he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) found himself round at the north side.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) entered the porch, and, reclining upon the
bench within, fell asleep.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVI



<p/>THE GURGOYLE: ITS DOINGS


<p/>THE tower of Weatherbury Church was a square
erection of fourteenth-century date, having two stone
gurgoyles on each of the four faces of its parapet. Of
these eight carved protuberances only two at this time
continued to serve the purpose of their erection -- that
of spouting the water from the lead roof within. One
mouth in each front had been closed by bygone church-
wardens as superfluous, and two others were broken
away and choked -- a matter not of much consequence
to the wellbeing of the tower, for the two mouths which
still remained open and active were gaping enough to do
all the work.
It has been sometimes argued that there is no truer
criterion of the vitality of any given art-period than the
power of the master-spirits of that time in grotesque;
and certainly in the instance of Gothic art there is no
disputing the proposition. Weatherbury tower was a
somewhat early instance of the use of an ornamental
parapet in parish as distinct from cathedral churches,
and the gurgoyles, which are the necessary correlatives
of a parapet, were exceptionally prominent -- of the
boldest cut that the hand could shape, and of the most
original design that a human brain could conceive.
There was, so to speak, that symmetry in their distortion
which is less the characteristic of British than of
Continental grotesques of the period. All the eight
were different from each other. A beholder was con-
vinced that nothing on earth could be more hideous
than those he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) saw on the north side until he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) went
round to the south. Of the two on this latter face, only
that at the south-eastern corner concerns the story. It
was too human to be called like a dragon, too impish
to be like a man, too animal to be like a fiend, and not
enough like a bird to be called a griffin. This horrible
stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled
hide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting from their
sockets, and its fingers and hands were seizing the
corners of its mouth, which they thus seemed to pull
open to give free passage to the water it vomited. The
lower row of teeth was quite washed away, though the
upper still remained. Here and thus, jutting a couple
of feet from the wall against which its feet rested as a
support, the creature had for four hundred years
laughed at the surrounding landscape, voicelessly in
dry weather, and in wet with a gurgling and snorting
sound.
Troy slept on in the porch, and the rain increased
outside. Presently the gurgoyle spat. In due time a
small stream began to trickle through the seventy feet
of aerial space between its mouth and the ground, which
the water-drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated
velocity. The stream thickened in substance, and in-
creased in power, gradually spouting further and yet
further from the side of the tower. When the rain fell
in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed
downward in volumes.
We follow its course to the ground at this point of
time. The end of the liquid parabola has come forward
from the wall, has advanced over the plinth mouldings,
over a heap of stones, over the marble border, into the
midst of Fanny Robin's grave.
The force of the stream had, until very lately, been
received upon some loose stones spread thereabout,
which had acted as a shield to the soil under the onset.
These during the summer had been cleared from the
ground, and there was now nothing to resist the down-
fall but the bare earth. For several years the stream
had not spouted so far from the tower as it was doing
on this night, and such a contingency had been over-
looked. Sometimes this obscure corner received no
inhabitant for the space of two or three years, and
then it was usually but a pauper, a poacher, or other
sinner of undignified sins.
The persistent torrent from the gurgoyle's jaws
directed all its vengeance into the grave. The rich
tawny mould was stirred into motion, and boiled like
chocolate. The water accumulated and washed deeper
down, and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into
the night as the head and chief among other noises of
the kind created by the deluging rain. The flowers so
carefully planted by Fanny's repentant lover began to
move and writhe in their bed. The winter-violets
turned slowly upside down, and became a mere mat of
mud. Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in
the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron. Plants
of the tufted species were loosened, rose to the surface,
and floated of.
Troy did not awake from his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) comfortless sleep till it
was broad day. Not having been in bed for two nights
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) shoulders felt stiff his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) feet tender, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) head
heavy. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) position, arose, shivered,
took the spade, and again went out.
The rain had quite ceased, and the sun was shining
through the green, brown, and yellow leaves, now
sparkling and varnished by the raindrops to the bright-
ness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and
Hobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that
arise from the union of water and colour with high
lights. The air was rendered so transparent by the
heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the middle
distance were as rich as those near at hand, and the
remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower ap-
peared in the same plane as the tower itself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) entered the gravel path which would take him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
behind the tower. The path, instead of being stony as
it had been the night before, was browned over with a
thin coating of mud. At one place in the path he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) saw
a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a
bundle of tendons. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) picked it up -- surely it could
not be one of the primroses he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) had planted? He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) saw
a bulb, another, and another as he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) advanced. Beyond
doubt they were the crocuses. With a face of perplexed
dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the
wreck the stream had made.
The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the
ground, and in its place was a hollow. The disturbed
earth was washed over the grass and pathway in the
guise of the brown mud he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) had already seen, and it
spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.
Nearly all the flowers were washed clean out of the
ground, and they lay, roots upwards, on the spots whither
they had been splashed by the stream.
Troy's brow became heavily contracted. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
teeth closely, and his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) compressed lips moved as those of
one in great pain. This singular accident, by a strange
confluence of emotions in him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>), was felt as the sharpest
sting of all. Troy's face was very expressive, and any
observer who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) now would hardly have
believed him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) to be a man who had laughed, and sung,
and poured love-trifles into a woman's ear. To curse
his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) miserable lot was at first his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) impulse, but even that
lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose
absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the
morbid misery which wrung him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>). The sight, coming
as it did, superimposed upon the other dark scenery of
the previous days, formed a sort of climax to the whole
panorama, and it was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) could endure.
Sanguine by nature, Troy had a power of eluding
grief by simply adjourning it. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) could put off the
consideration of any particular spectre till the matter
had become old and softened by time. The planting
of flowers on Fanny's grave had been perhaps but a
species of elusion of the primary grief, and now it was
as if his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) intention had been known and circumvented.
Almost for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) life, Troy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) stood
by this dismantled grave, wished himself another man.
lt is seldom that a person with much animal spirit does
not feel that the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) life being his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) own is the one
qualification which singles it out as a more hopeful life
than that of others who may actually resemble him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) in
every particular. Troy had felt, in his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) transient way,
hundreds of times, that he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) could not envy other people
their condition, because the possession of that condition
would have necessitated a different personality, when he (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>)
desired no other than his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) had not minded
the peculiarities of his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) birth, the vicissitudes of his (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) life,
the meteorlike uncertainty of all that related to him (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>),
because these appertained to the hero of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) story,
without whom there would have been no story at all for
him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>); and it seemed to be only in the nature of things
that matters would right themselves at some proper date
and wind up well. This very morning the illusion
completed its disappearance, and, as it were, all of a
sudden, Troy hated himself. The suddenness was
probably more apparent than real. A coral reef which
just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the
horizon than if it had never been begun, and the mere
finishing stroke is what often appears to create an event
which has long been potentially an accomplished thing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) stood and mediated -- a miserable man. Whither
should he (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) go? <div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that is accursed, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be accursed
still.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the pitiless anathema written in this spoliated
effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new-born solicitousness. A man who has
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) primal strength in journeying in one direction
has not much spirit left for reversing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course. Troy
had, since yesterday, faintly reversed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but the merest
opposition had disheartened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). To turn about would
have been hard enough under the greatest providential
encouragement; but to find that Providence, far from
helping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into a new course, or showing any wish
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might adopt one, actually jeered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first trembling
and critical attempt in that kind, was more than nature
could bear.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slowly withdrew from the grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not
attempt to fill up the hole, replace the flowers, or do
anything at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply threw up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cards and
forswore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) game for that time and always. Going out
of the churchyard silently and unobserved -- none of the
villagers having yet risen -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed down some fields
at the back, and emerged just as secretly upon the high
road. Shortly afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone from the village.
Meanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner
in the attic. The door was kept locked, except during
the entries and exits of Liddy, for whom a bed had
been arranged in a small adjoining room. The light
of Troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about
ten o'clock by the maid-servant, who casually glanced
from the window in that direction whilst taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)
supper, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) called Bathsheba's attention to it.
They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time,
until Liddy was sent to bed.
bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night.
When her (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) attendant was unconscious and softly breath-
ing in the next room, the mistress of the house was
still looking out of the window at the faint gleam
spreading from among the trees -- not in a steady shine,
but blinking like a revolving coastlight, though this
appearance failed to suggest to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) that a person was
passing and repassing in front of it. Bathsheba sat
here till it began to rain, and the light vanished, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) withdrew to lie restlessly in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) bed and re-enact
in a worn mind the lurid scene of yesternight.
Almost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) arose again, and opened the window to obtain a full
breathing of the new morning air, the panes being now
wet with trembling tears left by the night rain, each
one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-
hued slashes through a cloud low down in the awaken-
ing sky. From the trees came the sound of steady
dripping upon the drifted leaves under them, and from
the direction of the church she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could hear another noise
-- peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl
of water falling into a pool.
Liddy knocked at eight o'clock, and Bathsheba un-
locked the door.
<div class="bookquote">``What a heavy rain we've had in the night, ma'am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, when her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) inquiries about breakfast had been
made.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, very heavy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear the strange noise from the church
yard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I heard one strange noise. I've been thinking it
must have been the water from the tower spouts.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, that's what the shepherd was saying, ma'am.
He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>)'s now gone on to see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Gabriel has been here this morning!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only just looked in in passing -- quite in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) old way,
which I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had left off lately. But the tower
spouts used to spatter on the stones, and we are puzzled,
for this was like the boiling of a pot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>Not being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked
Liddy to stay and breakfast with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). The tongue of the
more childish woman still ran upon recent events. <div class="bookquote">``Are
you going across to the church, ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Not that I know of.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you might like to go and see where they
have put Fanny. The trees hide the place from your
window.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
husband. <div class="bookquote">``Has Mr. Troy been in to-night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said
``No, ma'am; I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)'s gone to Budmouth.
Budmouth! The sound of the word carried with
it a much diminished perspective of him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) deeds;
there were thirteen miles interval betwixt them now.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hated questioning Liddy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband's
movements, and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided
doing so; but now all the house knew that there had
been some dreadful disagreement between them, and
it was futile to attempt disguise. Bathsheba had
reached a stage at which people cease to have any
appreciative regard for public opinion.
``What makes you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) has gone there?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
``Laban Tall saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) on the Budmouth road this
morning before breakfast.''
Bathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward
heaviness of the past twenty-four hours which had
quenched the vitality of youth in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) without sub-
stituting the philosophy of maturer years, and the
resolved to go out and walk a little way. So when
breakfast was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet, and took
a direction towards the church. It was nine o'clock,
and the men having returned to work again from their
first meal, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not likely to meet many of them in
the road. Knowing that Fanny had been laid in the
reprobates' quarter of the graveyard, called in the parish
``behind church.'' which was invisible from the road, it
was impossible to resist the impulse to enter and look
upon a spot which, from nameless feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at the
same time dreaded to see. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been unable to
overcome an impression that some connection existed
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rival and the light through the trees.
Bathsheba skirted the buttress, and beheld the hole
and the tomb, its delicately veined surface splashed and
stained just as Troy had seen it and left it two hours
earlier. On the other side of the scene stood Gabriel.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) arrival
having been noiseless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had not as yet attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
attention. Bathsheba did not at once perceive that the
grand tomb and the disturbed grave were Fanny's, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked on both sides and around for some humbler
mound, earthed up and clodded in the usual way. Then
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye followed Oak's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) read the words with
which the inscription opened: --
<div class="bookquote">``Erected by Francis Troy in Beloved Memory of
Fanny Robin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) first act was to gaze inquiringly
and learn how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) received this knowledge of the
authorship of the work, which to himself had caused
considerable astonishment. But such discoveries did
not much affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now. Emotional convulsions seemed
to have become the commonplaces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) history, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) good morning, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) to fill in
the hole with the spade which was standing by. Whilst
Oak was doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desired, Bathsheba collected the
flowers, and began planting them with that sympathetic
manipulation of roots and leaves which is so conspicuous
in a woman's gardening, and which flowers seem to
understand and thrive upon. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) requested Oak to
get the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the
mouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon
them, that by this means the stream might be directed
sideways, and a repetition of the accident prevented.
Finally, with the superfluous magnanimity of a woman
whose narrower instincts have brought down bitterness
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instead of love, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wiped the mud spots from
the tomb as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rather liked its words than otherwise,




<p/>CHAPTER XLVII



<p/>ADVENTURES BY THE SHORE


<p/>TROY wandered along towards the south. A composite
feeling, made up of disgust with the, to him (<font color='blue'><b>churchwardens</b></font>), humdrum
tediousness of a farmer's life, gloomily images of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who
lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general averseness
to his (<font color='blue'><b>churchwardens</b></font>) wife's society, impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>churchwardens</b></font>) to seek a home in any
place on earth save Weatherbury. The sad accessories
of Fanny's end confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>churchwardens</b></font>) as vivid pictures which
threatened to be indelible, and made life in Bathsheba's
house intolerable. At three in the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>churchwardens</b></font>) found
himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,
which ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel
with the shore, and forming a monotonous barrier between
the basin of cultivated country inland and the wilder
scenery of the coast. Up the hill stretched a road
nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides
approaching each other in a gradual taper till they
met the sky at the top about two miles off. Through-
out the length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane
not a sign of life was visible on this garish afternoon
Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression
greater than any he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had experienced for many a day
and year before. The air was warm and muggy, and
the top seemed to recede as he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) approached.
At last he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) reached the summit, and a wide and
novel prospect burst upon him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) with an effect almost like
that of the Pacific upon Balboa's gaze. The broad
steely sea, marked only by faint lines, which had a
semblance of being etched thereon to a degree not deep
enough to disturb its general evenness, stretched the
whole width of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) front and round to the right, where,
near the town and port of Budmouth, the sun bristled
down upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute in
its place a clear oily polish. Nothing moved in sky,
land, or sea, except a frill of milkwhite foam along the
nearer angles of the shore, shreds of which licked the
contiguous stones like tongues.
He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) descended and came to a small basin of sea
enclosed by the cliffs. Troy's nature freshened within
him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would rest and bathe here before
going farther. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) undressed and plunged in. Inside
the cove the water was uninteresting to a swimmer,
being smooth as a pond, and to get a little of the ocean
swell, Troy presently swam between the two projecting
spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to
this miniature Mediterranean. Unfortunately for Troy
a current unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hercules</b></font>) existed outside, which, un-
important to craft of any burden, was awkward for a
swimmer who might be taken in it unawares. Troy
found himself carried to the left and then round in a
swoop out to sea.
He (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) now recollected the place and its sinister
character. Many bathers had there prayed for a dry
death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo also, had
been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) might be added to their number. Not a boat
of any kind was at present within sight, but far in the
distance Budmouth lay upon the sea, as it were quietly
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) efforts, and beside the town the harbour
showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and
spars. After wellnigh exhausting himself in attempts
to get back to the mouth of the cove, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) weakness
swimming several inches deeper than was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) wont,
keeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) breathing entirely by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) nostrils, turning
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) back a dozen times over, swimming EN PAPILLON
and so on, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread
water at a slight incline, and so endeavour to reach the
shore at any point, merely giving himself a gentle
impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direc-
tion of the tide. This, necessarily a slow process, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>)
found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there
was no choice of a landing-place -- the objects on shore
passing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) in a sad and slow procession -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) per-
ceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land yet
further to the right, now well defined against the sunny
portion of the horizon. While the swimmer's eye's were
fixed upon the spit as his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) only means of salvation on
this side of the Unknown, a moving object broke the
outline of the extremity, and immediately a ship's boat
appeared manned with several sailor lads, her (<font color='blue'><b>Gonzalo</b></font>) bows
towards the sea.
All Troy's vigour spasmodically revived to prolong
the struggle yet a little further. Swimming with his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
right arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) left to hail them, splashing
upon the waves, and shouting with all his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) might. From
the position of the setting sun his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) white form was
distinctly visible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the
sea to the east of the boat, and the men saw him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) at
once. Backing their oars and putting the boat about,
they pulled towards him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) with a will, and in five or six
minutes from the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) first halloo, two of the
sailors hauled him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) in over the stern.
They formed part of a brig's crew, and had come
ashore for sand. Lending him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) what little clothing they
could spare among them as a slight protection against
late they made again towards the roadstead where their
And now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery
levels in front; and at no great distance from them,
where the shoreline curved round, and formed a long
riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of points of
yellow light began to start into existence, denoting the
spot to be the site of Budmouth, where the lamps were
being lighted along the parade. The cluck of their
oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the
sea, and as they laboured amid the thickening shades
the lamplights grew larger, each appearing to send a
flaming sword deep down into the waves before it, until
there arose, among other dim shapes of the kind, the
form of the vessel for which they were bound.




<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII



<p/>DOUBTS ARISE -- DOUBTS LINGER


<p/>BATHSHEBA underwent the enlargement of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
Husband's absence from hours to days with a slight
feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling of relief; yet
neither sensation rose at any time far above the level
commonly designated as indifference. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) belonged to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Husband</b></font>): the certainties of that position were so well defined,
and the reasonable probabilities of its issue so bounded
that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not speculate on contingencies. Taking
no further interest in herself as a splendid woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in contem-
plating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) probable fate as a singular wretch; for Bath-
sheba drew herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) future in colours that no
reality could exceed for darkness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) original vigorous
pride of youth had sickened, and with it had declined
all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxieties about coming years, since anxiety
recognizes a better and a worse alternative, and Bath-
sheba had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind that alternatives on any
noteworthy scale had ceased for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Soon, or later --
and that not very late -- her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband would be home
again. And then the days of their tenancy of the
Upper Farm would be numbered. There had origin-
ally been shown by the agent to the estate some distrust
of Bathsheba's tenure as James Everdene's successor,
on the score of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sex, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beauty;
but the peculiar nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uncle's will, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own
frequent testimony before his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) death to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cleverness
in such a pursuit, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vigorous marshalling of the
numerous flocks and herds which came suddenly into
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands before negotiations were concluded, had won
confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) powers, and no further objections had
been raised. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had latterly been in great doubt as
to what the legal effects of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage would be upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position; but no notice had been taken as yet of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) change of name, and only one point was clear -- that
in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own or her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's inability to
meet the agent at the forthcoming January rent-day,
very little consideration would be shown, and, for that
matter, very little would be deserved. Once out of the
farm, the approach of poverty would be sure.
Hence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
purposes were broken of. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not a woman who
could hope on without good materials for the process,
differing thus from the less far-Sighted and energetic,
though more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope
goes on as a sort of clockwork which the merest food
and shelter are sufficient to wind up; and perceiving
clearly that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mistake had been a fatal one, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position, and waited coldly for the end.
The first Saturday after Troy's departure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went
to Casterbridge alone, a journey she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not before
taken since her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage. On this Saturday Bathsheba
was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of rural
business-men gathered as usual in front of the market-
house, who were as usual gazed upon by the burghers
with feelings that those healthy lives were dearly paid
for by exclusion from possible aldermanship, when a
man, who had apparently been following her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), said some
words to another on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left hand. Bathsheba's ears
were keen as those of any wild animal, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dis-
tinctly heard what the speaker said, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back
was towards him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``I am looking for Mrs. Troy. Is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; that's the young lady, I believe.''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>said the
the person addressed.
<div class="bookquote">``I have some awkward news to break to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)
husband is drowned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>As if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba
gasped out, <div class="bookquote">``No, it is not true; it cannot be true!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said and heard no more. The ice of self-
command which had latterly gathered over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
broken, and the currents burst forth again, and over
whelmed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). A darkness came into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
fell.
But not to the ground. A gloomy man, who had
been observing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from under the portico of the old
corn-exchange when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed through the group
without, stepped quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side at the moment of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclamation, and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sank
down.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, looking up at the
bringer of the big news, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) supported her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) husband was drowned this week while bathing
in Lulwind Cove. A coastguardsman found his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) clothes,
and brought them into Budmouth yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Thereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood's eye,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) face flushed with the suppressed excitement of
an unutterable thought. Everybody's glance was now
centred upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) and the unconscious Bathsheba. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bodily off the ground, and smoothed down
the folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress as a child might have taken a
storm-beaten bird and arranged its ruffled plumes, and
bore her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) along the pavement to the King's Arms Inn.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) passed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) under the archway into a
private room; and by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had deposited -- so
lothly -- the precious burden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes. Remembering all that had occurred,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I want to go home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Boldwood left the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) stood for a moment in
the passage to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) senses. The experience had
been too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) consciousness to keep up with,
and now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had grasped it it had gone again. For
those few heavenly, golden moments she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
arms. What did it matter about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not knowing it? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had been close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) breast; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had been close to hers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) started onward again, and sending a woman to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), went out to ascertain all the facts of the case.
These appeared to be limited to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had already
heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) then ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) horse to be put into the
gig, and when all was ready returned to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) found that, though still pale and unwell, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had in
the meantime sent for the Budmouth man who brought
the tidings, and learnt from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all there was to know.
Being hardly in a condition to drive home as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had driven to town, Boldwood, with every delicacy of
manner and feeling, offered to get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a driver, or to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a seat in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) phaeton, which was more com-
fortable than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own conveyance. These proposals
Bathsheba gently declined, and the farmer at once de-
parted.
About half-an-hour later she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) invigorated herself by
an effort, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat and the reins as usual-in
external appearance much as if nothing had happened.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went out of the town by a tortuous back street, and
drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the
scene. The first shades of evening were showing them-
selves when Bathsheba reached home, where, silently
alighting and leaving the horse in the hands of the boy,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proceeded at once upstairs. Liddy met her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the
landing. The news had preceded Bathsheba to Weather-
bury by half-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mistress's face. Bathsheba had nothing to say.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bedroom and sat by the window, and
thought and thought till night enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the
extreme lines only of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shape were visible. Somebody
came to the door, knocked, and opened it.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, what is it, Liddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``I was thinking there must be something got for you
to wear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, with hesitation.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mourning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, hurriedly.
<div class="bookquote">``But I suppose there must be something done for
poor -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at present, I think. It is not necessary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why not, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>)'s still alive.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, amazed.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know it. But wouldn't it have been different,
or shouldn't I have heard more, or wouldn't they have
found him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>), Liddy? -- or-i don't know how it is, but
death would have been different from how this is. I am
perfectly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) is still alive!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday,
when two circumstances conjoined to shake it. The
first was a short paragraph in the local newspaper, which,
beyond making by a methodizing pen formidable pre-
sumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning, con-
tained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker,
M.D., of Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness
of the accident, in a letter to the editor. In this he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>)
stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) was passing over the cliff on the remoter
side of the cove just as the sun was setting. At that
time he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) saw a bather carried along in the current outside
the mouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that
there was but a poor chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) unless he (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) should
be possessed of unusual muscular powers. He (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) drifted
behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker followed
along the shore in the same direction. But by the time
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) could reach an elevation sufficiently great to
command a view of the sea beyond, dusk had set in, and
nothing further was to be seen.
The other circumstance was the arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) clothes,
when it became necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) to examine and identify
them -- though this had virtually been done long before
by those who inspected the letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) pockets. It
was so evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) agitation that
Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing
again almost immediately, that the notion that anything
but death could have prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) was a perverse one
to entertain.
Then Bathsheba said to herself that others were
assured in their opinion; strange that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) should not
be. A strange reflection occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
face to flush. Suppose that Troy had followed Fanny
into another world. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) done this intentionally, yet
contrived to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) death appear like an accident?
Nevertheless, this thought of how the apparent might
differ from the real-made vivid by her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) bygone jealousy
of Fanny, and the remorse he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had shown that night
-- did not blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) to the perception of a likelier
difference, less tragic, but to herself far more disastrous.
When alone late that evening beside a small fire, and
much calmed down, Bathsheba took Troy's watch into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand, which had been restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) with the rest
of the articles belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) opened the case
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Barker</b></font>) had opened it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) a week ago. There was
the little coil of pale hair which had been as the fuze to
this great explosion.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) was hers and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>); they should be gone
together.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am nothing to either of them,
and why should I keep her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hair?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) took it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
hand, and held it over the fire.<div class="bookquote">'' No-i'll not burn it
-i'll keep it in memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) added,
snatching back her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand.




<p/>CHAPTER XLIX



<p/>OAK``S ADVANCEMENT -- A GREAT HOPE


<p/>THE later autumn and the winter drew on apace,
and the leaves lay thick upon the turf of the glades
and the mosses of the woods. Bathsheba, having
previously been living in a state of suspended feeling
which was not suspense, now lived in a mood of
quietude which was not precisely peacefulness. While
she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) to be alive she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could have thought
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) death with equanimity; but now that it might be
she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) was not hers
still. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) kept the farm going, raked in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) profits
without caring keenly about them, and expended
money on ventures because she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had done so in bygone
days, which, though not long gone by, seemed infinitely
removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) present. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) looked back upon that
past over a great gulf, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) were now a dead person,
having the faculty of meditation still left in her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), by
means of which, like the mouldering gentlefolk of the
poet's story, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could sit and ponder what a gift life
used to be.
However, one excellent result of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) general apathy
was the long-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>bailiff</b></font>) having virtually exercised that function for a long
time already, the change, beyond the substantial in-
crease of wages it brought, was little more than a
nominal one addressed to the outside world.
Boldwood lived secluded and inactive. Much of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) wheat and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) barley of that season had been
spoilt by the rain. It sprouted, grew into intricate
mats, and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls.
The strange neglect which had produced this ruin
and waste became the subject of whispered talk among
all the people round; and it was elicited from one of
Boldwood's men that forgetfulness had nothing to do
with it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had been reminded of the danger to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors
dared to do. The sight of the pigs turning in disgust
from the rotten ears seemed to arouse Boldwood, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) one evening sent for Oak. Whether it was sug-
gested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not,
the farmer proposed at the interview that Gabriel
should undertake the superintendence of the Lower
Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because of the necessity
Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility of
discovering a more trustworthy man. Gabriel's malig-
nant star was assuredly setting fast.
Bathsheba, when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) learnt of this proposal-for
Oak was obliged to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) -- at first languidly
objected. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) considered that the two farms together
were too extensive for the observation of one man.
Boldwood, who was apparently determined by personal
rather than commercial reasons, suggested that Oak
should be furnished with a horse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sole use,
when the plan would present no difficulty, the two
farms lying side by side. Boldwood did not directly
communicate with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) during these negotiations, only
speaking to Oak, who was the go-between throughout.
All was harmoniously arranged at last, and we now
see Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting
the length breadth of about two thousand acres
in a cheerful spirit of surveillance, as if the crops
belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) -- the actual mistress of the one-half
and the master of the other, sitting in their respective
homes in gloomy and sad seclusion.
Out of this there arose, during the spring succeeding,
a talk in the parish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
nest fast.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever d'ye think.''  (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>said Susan Tall,<div class="bookquote">'' Gable Oak
is coming it quite the dand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gable</b></font>) now wears shining
boots with hardly a hob in 'em, two or three times
a-week, and a tall hat a-Sundays, and 'a hardly knows
the name of smockfrock. When I see people strut
enough to he (<font color='blue'><b>Gable</b></font>) cut up into bantam cocks, I stand
dormant with wonder, and says no more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Susan Tall/Susan/Tall</b></font>)</div>It was eventually known that Gabriel, though paid
a fixed wage by Bathsheba independent of the fluctua-
tions of agricultural profits, had made an engagement
with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a share
of the receipts -- a small share certainly, yet it was
money of a higher quality than mere wages, and
capable of expansion in a way that wages were not.
Some were beginning to consider Oak a <div class="bookquote">``near''  (<font color='red'><b>Oak a man</b></font>)</div>man,
for though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition had thus far improved, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lived in no better style than before, occupying the
same cottage, paring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own potatoes, mending his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stockings, and sometimes even making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed with
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own hands. But as Oak was not only provokingly
indifferent to public opinion, but a man who clung
persistently to old habits and usages, simply because
they were old, there was room for doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
motives.
A great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood,
whose unreasoning devotion to Bathsheba could only
be characterized as a fond madness which neither
time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could
weaken or destroy. This fevered hope had grown up
again like a grain of mustard-seed during the quiet
which followed the hasty conjecture that Troy was
drowned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) nourished it fearfully, and almost
shunned the contemplation of it in earnest, lest facts
should reveal the wildness of the dream. Bathsheba
having at last been persuaded to wear mourning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
appearance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) entered the church in that guise
was in itself a weekly addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) faith that a
time was coming -- very far off perhaps, yet surely
nearing -- when his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) waiting on events should have
its reward. How long he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) might have to wait he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had
not yet closely considered. what he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) would try to
recognize was that the severe schooling she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had been
subjected to had made Bathsheba much more con-
siderate than she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had formerly been of the feelings of
others, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) trusted that, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) be willing at
any time in the future to marry any man at all, that
man would be himself. There was a substratum of
good feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) self-reproach for the injury
she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had thoughtlessly done him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be depended
upon now to a much greater extent than before her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
infatuation and disappointment. It would be possible
to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) by the channel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) good nature,
and to suggest a friendly businesslike compact between
them for fulfilment at some future day, keeping the
passionate side of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire entirely out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) sight.
Such was Boldwood's hope.
To the eyes of the middle-aged, Bathsheba was
perhaps additionally charming just now. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) exuber-
ance of spirit was pruned down; the original phantom
of delight had shown herself to be not too bright for
human nature's daily food, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had been able to
enter this second poetical phase without losing much
of the first in the process.
Bathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
old aunt at Norcombe afforded the impassioned and
yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring directly after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) -- now possibly in the ninth month of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
widowhood -- and endeavouring to get a notion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
middle of the haymaking, and Boldwood contrived to
<div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said
She (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) simpered, and wondered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) heart why he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
``I hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) long
the coldest-hearted neighbour could scarcely say less
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is quite well, sir.
``Yes, cheerful.
``Fearful, did you say?''
``O no. I merely said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was cheerful.''
``Tells you all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) affairs?''
``No, sir.
<div class="bookquote">``Some of them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes, sir.
``Mrs Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia,
and very wisely, perhaps.''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) do, sir. I've been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) all through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
troubles, and was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) at the time of Mr. Troy's
going and all. And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) were to marry again I
expect I should bide with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).''
``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) promises that you shall -- quite natural.'' said
the strategic lover, throbbing throughout him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) at the
presumption which Liddy's words appeared to warrant
-- that his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) darling had thought of re-marriage.
``No -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) doesn't promise it exactly. I merely
judge on my own account.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I understand. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) alludes to the
possibility of marrying again, you conclude -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) never do allude to it, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, thinking
how very stupid Mr. Boldwood was getting.
<div class="bookquote">``Of course not.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) returned hastily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hope falling
again.<div class="bookquote">'' You needn't take quite such long reaches with
your rake, Lydia -- short and quick ones are best. Well,
perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is absolute mistress again now, it is wise
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to resolve never to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My mistress did certainly once say, though not
seriously, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) might marry again at
the end of seven years from last year, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cared to
risk Mr. Troy's coming back and claiming her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, six years from the present time. Said that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
might. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) might marry at once in every reasonable
person's opinion, whatever the lawyers may say to the
contrary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you been to ask them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, innocently.
<div class="bookquote">``Not I.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, growing red.<div class="bookquote">'' Liddy, you
needn't stay here a minute later than you wish, so Mr,
Oak says. I am now going on a little farther. Good''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>afternoon.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) went away vexed with himself, and ashamed of
having for this one time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) life done anything which
could be called underhand. Poor Boldwood had no
more skill in finesse than a battering-ram, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was
uneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear
stupid and, what was worse, mean. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had, after
all, lighted upon one fact by way of repayment. It was
a singularly fresh and fascinating fact, and though not
without its sadness it was pertinent and real. In little
more than six years from this time Bathsheba might
certainly marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). There was something definite in
that hope, for admitting that there might have been no
deep thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) words to Liddy about marriage,
they showed at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) creed on the matter.
This pleasant notion was now continually in his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) mind.
Six years were a long time, but how much shorter than
never, the idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) had for so long been obliged to
endure! Jacob had served twice seven years for
Rachel: what were six for such a woman as this? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>)
tried to like the notion of waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) better than
that of winning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at once. Boldwood felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) love
to be so deep and strong and eternal, that it was pos-
sible she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never yet known its full volume, and this
patience in delay would afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) an opportunity of
giving sweet proof on the point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would annihilate
the six years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) life as if they were minutes -- so little
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) value his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) time on earth beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
would let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) see, all those six years of intangible ether-
eal courtship, how little care he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had for anything but as
it bore upon the consummation.
Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought
round the week in which Greenhill Fair was held.
This fair was frequently attended by the folk of Weather-
bury.




<p/>CHAPTER L



<p/>THE SHEEP FAIR -- TROY TOUCHES HIS (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) WIFE``S HAND


<p/>GREENHILL was the Nijni Novgorod of South
Wessex; and the busiest, merriest, noisiest day of the
whole statute number was the day of the sheep fair.
This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill
which retained in good preservation the remains of an
ancient earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and
entrenchment of an oval form encircling the top of
the hill, though somewhat broken down here and there.
To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a
winding road ascended, and the level green space of
ten or fifteen acres enclosed by the bank was the
site of the fair. A few permanent erections dotted the
spot, but the majority of visitors patronized canvas alone
for resting and feeding under during the time of their
sojourn here.
Shepherds who attended with their flocks from long
distances started from home two or three days, or even
a week, before the fair, driving their charges a few miles
each day -- not more than ten or twelve -- and resting
them at night in hired fields by the wayside at pre-
viously chosen points, where they fed, having fasted since
morning. The shepherd of each flock marched behind,
a bundle containing his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) kit for the week strapped upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) shoulders, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hand his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) crook, which he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) used
as the staff of his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) pilgrimage. Several of the sheep
would get worn and lame, and occasionally a lambing
occurred on the road. To meet these contingencies,
there was frequently provided, to accompany the flocks
from the remoter points, a pony and waggon into which
the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the
journey.
The Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such
long distance from the hill, and those arrangements
were not necessary in their case. But the large united
flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a
valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much
attention, and on this account Gabriel, in addition to
Boldwood's shepherd and Cain Ball, accompanied them
along the way, through the decayed old town of Kings-
bere, and upward to the plateau, -- old George the dog
of course behind them.
When the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this
morning and lighted the dewy flat upon its crest, nebu-
lous clouds of dust were to be seen floating between
the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect
around in all directions. These gradually converged
upon the base of the hill, and the flocks became
individually visible, climbing the serpentine ways which
led to the top. Thus, in a slow procession, they entered
the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after
multitude, horned and hornless -- blue flocks and red
flocks, buff flocks and brown flocks, even green and
salmon-tinted flocks, according to the fancy of the
colourist and custom of the farm. Men were shouting,
dogs were barking, with greatest animation, but the
thronging travellers in so long a journey had grown
nearly indifferent to such terrors, though they still
bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experi-
ences, a tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst
of them, like a gigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate
devotees.
The great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of
South Downs and the old Wessex horned breeds, to
the latter class Bathsheba's and Farmer Boldwood's
mainly belonged. These filed in about nine o'clock,
their vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side
of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals, a small
pink and white ear nestling under each horn. Before
and behind came other varieties, perfect leopards as to
the full rich substance of their coats, and only lacking the
spots. There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed,
whose wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen
hair, though surpassed in this respect by the effeminate
Leicesters, which were in turn less curly than the Cots-
wolds. But the most picturesque by far was a small
flock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year.
Their pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses
of wool hanging round their swarthy foreheads, quite
relieved the monotony of the flocks in that quarter.
All these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had
entered and were penned before the morning had far
advanced, the dog belonging to each flock being tied to
the corner of the pen containing it. Alleys for pedes-
trians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded
with buyers and sellers from far and near.
In another part of the hill an altogether different
scene began to force itself upon the eye towards mid-
day. A circular tent, of exceptional newness and size,
was in course of erection here. As the day drew on,
the flocks began to change hands, lightening the shep-
herd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention
to this tent and inquired of a man at work there, whose
soul seemed concentrated on tying a bothering knot in
no time, what was going on.
<div class="bookquote">``The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's
Ride to York and the Death of Black Bess.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>replied the
man promptly, without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eyes or leaving off
trying.
As soon as the tent was completed the band struck
up highly stimulating harmonies, and the announce-
ment was publicly made, Black Bess standing in a con-
spicuous position on the outside, as a living proof, If
proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances
from the stage over which the people were to enter.
These were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
heart and understanding both that they soon began to
crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible
Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday
keeping here to-day,
<div class="bookquote">''`That's the great ruffen pushing me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>screamed a
woman in front of Jan over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) when
the rush was at its fiercest.
<div class="bookquote">``How can I help pushing ye when the folk behind
push me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, in a deprecating tone, turning
without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) body, which was jammed as in a vice.
There was a silence; then the drums and trumpets
again sent forth their echoing notes. The crowd was
again ecstasied, and gave another lurch in which Coggan
and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon
the women in front.
<div class="bookquote">``O that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of
she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) swayed like a reed shaken by the wind.
Now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice
to the public at large as it stood clustered about his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
shoulder-blades. <div class="bookquote">``Did ye ever hear such onreasonable
woman as that? Upon my carcase, neighbours, if I
could only get out of this cheesewring, the damn women
might eat the show for me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't ye lose yer temper, Jan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>implored Joseph
Poorgrass, in a whisper.<div class="bookquote">'' They might get their men to
murder us, for I think by the shine of their eyes that
they be a sinful form of womankind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>Jan held his (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) tongue, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jan</b></font>) had no objection to be
pacified to please a friend, and they gradually reached
the foot of the ladder, Poorgrass being flattened like a
jumping-jack, and the sixpence, for admission, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>)
had got ready half-an-hour earlier, having become so
reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) excited hand that
the woman in spangles, brazen rings set with glass
diamonds, and with chalked face and shoulders, who
took the money of him (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>), hastily dropped it again from
a fear that some trick had been played to burn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
fingers. So they all entered, and the cloth of the
tent, to the eyes of an observer on the outside, became
bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on
a sack of potatoes, caused by the various human heads,
backs, and elbows at high pressure within.
At the rear of the large tent there were two small
dressing-tents. One of these, alloted to the male per-
formers, was partitioned into halves by a cloth; and in
one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass, pull
ing on a pair of jack-boots, a young man whom we
instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy.
Troy's appearance in this position may be briefly
accounted for. The brig aboard which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) was taken in
Budmouth Roads was about to start on a voyage, though
somewhat short of hands. Troy read the articles and
joined, but before they sailed a boat was despatched
across the bay to Lulwind cove; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) had half expected,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) clothes were gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) ultimately worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) passage
to the United States, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) made a precarious living
in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics, Sword
Exercise, Fencing, and Pugilism. A few months were
sufficient to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) a distaste for this kind of life.
There was a certain animal form of refinement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>)
nature; and however pleasant a strange condition might
be whilst privations were easily warded off, it was dis-
advantageously coarse when money was short. There
was ever present, too, the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) could claim a
home and its comforts did he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) but chose to return to
England and Weatherbury Farm. Whether Bathsheba
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) dead was a frequent subject of curious
conjecture. To England he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) did return at last; but the
but the fact of drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its
fascinations, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) intention to enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) old groove at
the place became modified. It was with gloom he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) con-
sidered on landing at Liverpool that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) were to go home
his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) reception would be of a kind very unpleasant to con-
template; for what Troy had in the way of emotion was
an occasional fitful sentiment which sometimes caused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and
healthy kind. Bathsheba was not a women to be made
a fool of, or a woman to suffer in silence; and how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) endure existence with a spirited wife to whom
at first entering he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would be beholden for food and
lodging? Moreover, it was not at all unlikely that his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
wife would fail at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) farming, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not already
done so; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) would then become liable for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
maintenance: and what a life such a future of poverty
with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would be, the spectre of Fanny constantly be-
tween them, harrowing his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) temper and embittering her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
words! Thus, for reasons touching on distaste, regret,
and shame commingled, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) put off his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) return from day
to day, and would have decided to put it off altogether
if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could have found anywhere else the ready-made
establishment which existed for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) there.
At this time -- the July preceding the September in
which we find at Greenhill Fair -- he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fell in with a
travelling circus which was performing in the outskirts of
a northern town. Troy introduced himself to the
manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe, hitting
a suspended apple with pistol-- bullet fired from the
animal's back when in full gallop, and other feats. For
his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) merits in these -- all more or less based upon his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) ex-
periences as a dragoon-guardsman -- Troy was taken into
the company, and the play of Turpin was prepared with
a view to his (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) personation of the chief character. Troy
was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) was undoubtedly treated, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) thought the engage-
ment might afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) a few weeks for consideration.
It was thus carelessly, and without having formed any
definite plan for the future, that Troy found himself
at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this
day.
And now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in
front of the pavilion the following incident had taken
place. Bathsheba -- who was driven to the fair that day
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) odd man Poorgrass -- had, like every one else,
read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the
Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would
enact the part of Turpin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) was not yet too old
and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>).
This particular show was by far the largest and grandest
in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping themselves
under its shade like chickens around a hen. The crowd
had passed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching
all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>), seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) comparatively isolated, came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) side.
<div class="bookquote">``I hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said, nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``O yes, thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, colour springing
up in the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) cheeks. <div class="bookquote">``I was fortunate
enough to sell them all just as we got upon the hill, so
we hadn't to pen at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And now you are entirely at leisure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes, except that I have to see one more dealer in
two hours' time: otherwise I should be going home.
He (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) was looking at this large tent and the announcement.
Have you ever seen the play of ``Turpin's Ride to
York?<div class="bookquote">'' Turpin was a real man, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Turpin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes, perfectly true -- all of it. Indeed, I think
I've heard Jan Coggan say that a relation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) knew
Tom King, Turpin's friend, quite well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Coggan is rather given to strange stories connected
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) relations, we must remember. I hope they
can all be believed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; we know Coggan. But Turpin is true
enough. You have never seen it played, I suppose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never. I was not allowed to go into these places
when I was young. Hark! What's that prancing?
How they shout!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Black Bess just started off, I suppose. Am I right
in supposing you would like to see the performance,
Mrs. Troy? Please excuse my mistake, if it is one;
but if you would like to, I'll get a seat for you with
pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) hesitated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I
myself shall not stay to see it: I've seen it before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now Bathsheba did care a little to see the show, and
had only withheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) feet from the ladder because she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>)
feared to go in alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) had been hoping that Oak
might appear, whose assistance in such cases was always
accepted as an inalienable right, but Oak was nowhere
to be seen; and hence it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Then if
you will just look in first, to see if there's room, I think
I will go in for a minute or two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared
in the tent with Boldwood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) elbow, who, taking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) to a <div class="bookquote">``reserved''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>seat, again withdrew.
This feature consisted of one raised bench in very
conspicuous part of the circle, covered with red cloth,
and floored with a piece of carpet, and Bathsheba
immediately found, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) confusion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) was the
single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of the
crowded spectators, one and all, standing on their legs
on the borders of the arena, where they got twice as
good a view of the performance for half the money.
Hence as many eyes were turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>), enthroned
alone in this place of honour, against a scarlet back-
ground, as upon the ponies and clown who were
engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre, Turpin
not having yet appeared. Once there, Bathsheba was
forced to make the best of it and remain: she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) sat
down, spreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) skirts with some dignity over the
unoccupied space on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>), and giving a
new and feminine aspect to the pavilion. In a few
minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) noticed the fat red nape of Coggan's neck
among those standing just below her (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>), and Joseph Poor-
grass's saintly profile a little further on.
The interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade.
The strange luminous semi-opacities of fine autumn
afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects
the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes
and divisions in the canvas, and spirted like jets of
gold-dust across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze
pervading the tent, until they alighted on inner surfaces
of cloth opposite, and shone like little lamps suspended
there.
Troy, on peeping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) dressing-tent through a
slit for a reconnoitre before entering, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) unconscious
wife on high before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) as described, sitting as queen
of the tournament. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) started back in utter confusion,
for although his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) disguise effectually concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) person-
ality, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) instantly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) would be sure to recognize
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) had several times during the day thought
of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other
appearing and recognizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) had taken the
risk carelessly. If they see me, let them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) had said.
But here was Bathsheba in her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) own person; and the
reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) prefigurings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) had not half enough
considered the point.
She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) looked so charming and fair that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) cool mood
about Weatherbury people was changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) had not
expected her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) to exercise this power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) in the
twinkling of an eye. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) go on, and care nothing?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) could not bring himself to do that. Beyond a politic
wish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>)
now a sense of shame at the possibility that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>)
attractive young wife, who already despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>), should
despise him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) more by discovering him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) in so mean a
condition after so long a time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) actually blushed
at the thought, and was vexed beyond measure that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury should
have led him (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) to dally about the country in this way.
But Troy was never more clever than when absolutely
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) wit's end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) hastily thrust aside the curtain
dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rembrandt</b></font>) own little dressing space from that of the
manager and proprietor, who now appeared as the
individual called Tom King as far down as his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) waist, and
as the aforesaid respectable manager thence to his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) toes.
<div class="bookquote">``Here's the devil to pay!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy.
<div class="bookquote">``How's that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's a blackguard creditor in the tent I don't
want to see, who'll discover me and nab me as sure as
Satan if I open my mouth. What's to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You must appear now, I think.''
``I can't.<div class="bookquote">''
But the play must proceed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you give out that Turpin has got a bad cold,
and can't speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>) part, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Turpin</b></font>)'ll perform it just
the same without speaking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The proprietor</b></font>)</div>The proprietor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) head.
``Anyhow, play or no play, I won't open my mouth,
said Troy, firmly.
``Very well, then let me see. I tell you how we'll
manage.'' said the other, who perhaps felt it would be
extremely awkward to offend his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) leading man just at
this time. ``I won't tell 'em anything about your
keeping silence; go on with the piece and say nothing,
doing what you can by a judicious wink now and then,
and a few indomitable nods in the heroic places, you
know. They'll never find out that the speeches are
omitted.''
This seemed feasible enough, for Turpin's speeches
were not many or long, the fascination of the piece
lying entirely in the action; and accordingly the play
began, and at the appointed time Black Bess leapt
into the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators.
At the turnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly
pursued at midnight by the officers, and half-awake
gatekeeper in his (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) tasselled nightcap denies that any
horseman has passed, Coggan uttered a broad-chested
``Well done!'' which could be heard all over the fair
above the bleating, and Poorgrass smiled delightedly
with a nice sense of dramatic contrast between our
hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in
the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Poorgrass</b></font>) enemies, who must needs pull up
cumbersomely and wait to be let through. At the
death of Tom King, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could not refrain from seizing
Coggan by the hand, and whispering, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
eyes, ``Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not really shot, Jan -- only
seemingly!'' And when the last sad scene came on,
and the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had to
be carried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from
among the spectators, nothing could restrain Poorgrass
from lending a hand, exclaiming, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) asked Jan to
join him (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>), ``Twill be something to tell of at Warren's in
future years, Jan, and hand down to our children.<div class="bookquote">'' For
many a year in Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air
of a man who had had experiences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>)
touched with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) own hand the hoof of Bess as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) lay
upon the board upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) shoulder. If, as some thinkers
hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others''
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>memories, then did Black Bess become immortal that
day if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) never had done so before.
Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>)
ordinary make-up for the character, the more effectually
to disguise himself, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) had felt faint qualms
on first entering, the metamorphosis effected by judici-
ously <div class="bookquote">``lining''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) face with a wire rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) safe from
the eyes of Bathsheba and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) men. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>)
was relieved when it was got through.
There a second performance in the evening, and
the tent was lighted up. Troy had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) part very
quietly this time, venturing to introduce a few speeches
on occasion; and was just concluding it when, whilst
standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first
row of spectators, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) observed within a yard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bess</b></font>) the
eye of a man darted keenly into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side features. Troy
hastily shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, after having recognized in
sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of
At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide
by circumstances. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been recognized by
this man was highly probable; yet there was room for
a doubt. Then the great objection he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had felt to
allowing news of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proximity to precede him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
Weatherbury in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return, based on a
feeling that knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present occupation would
discredit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still further in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's eyes, returned
in full force. Moreover, should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolve not to
return at all, a tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being alive and being in
the neighbourhood would be awkward; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
anxious to acquire a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's temporal
affairs before deciding which to do.
In this dilemma Troy at once went out to recon-
noitre. It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that to find Pennyways, and
make a friend of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) if possible, would be a very wise
act. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had put on a thick beard borrowed from the
establishment, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wandered about the fair-
field. It was now almost dark, and respectable people
were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home
The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided
by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town. This was
considered an unexceptionable place for obtaining the
necessary food and rest: Host Trencher -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>innkeeper</b></font>) was
jauntily called by the local newspaper-RRB- being a sub-
stantial man of high repute for catering through all the
county round. The tent was divided into first and
second-class compartments, and at the end of the first-
class division was a yet further enclosure for the most
exclusive, fenced of from the body of the tent by a
luncheon-bar, behind which the host himself stood
bustling about in white apron and shirt-sleeves, and look-
ing as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never lived anywhere but under canvas
all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. In these penetralia were chairs and a table,
which, on candles being lighted, made quite a cozy and
luxurious show, with an urn, plated tea and coffee pots,
china teacups, and plum cakes.
Troy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a
gipsy-woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of
sticks and selling them at a penny a-piece, and looked
over the heads of the people within. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see
nothing of Pennyways, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon discerned Bathsheba
through an opening into the reserved space at the
further end. Troy thereupon retreated, went round the
tent into the darkness, and listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear
Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the canvas; she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
was conversing with a man. A warmth overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
face: surely she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was not so unprincipled as to flirt in
a fair! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wondered if, then, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) reckoned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
death as an absolute certainty. To get at the root of
the matter, Troy took a penknife from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and
softly made two little cuts crosswise in the cloth, which,
by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a
wafer. Close to this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, withdrawing
it again in a movement of surprise; for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye had
been within twelve inches of the top of Bathsheba's
head. lt was too near to be convenient. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made
another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a
shaded place beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) chair, from which it was easy
and safe to survey her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) by looking horizontally'.
Troy took in the scene completely now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was
leaning back, sipping a cup of tea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)
hand, and the owner of the male voice was Boldwood,
who had apparently just brought the cup to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>),
Bathsheba, being in a negligent mood, leant so idly
against the canvas that it was pressed to the shape of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) shoulder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was, in fact, as good as in Troy's
arms; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was obliged to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) breast carefully
backward that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) might not feel its warmth through the
cloth as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) gazed in.
Troy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred
again within him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) as they had been stirred earlier in the
day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was handsome as ever, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). It
was some minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could counteract his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) sudden
wish to go in, and claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thought how
the proud girl who had always looked down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
even whilst it was to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), would hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) on dis-
covering him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) to be a strolling player. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) to make
himself known, that chapter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) life must at all risks
be kept for ever from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and from the Weatherbury
people, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) name would be a byword throughout the
parish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would be nicknamed <div class="bookquote">``Turpin''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lived. Assuredly before he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could claim her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) these few
past months of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) existence must be entirely blotted out.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall I get you another cup before you start,
ma'am?''  (<font color='red'><b>Farmer Boldwood</b></font>)</div>said Farmer Boldwood.
I thank you,'' said Bathsheba. ``But I must be going
at once. It was great neglect in that man to keep me
waiting here till so late. I should have gone two hours
ago, if it had not been for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I had no idea of
coming in here; but there's nothing so refreshing as a
cup of tea, though I should never have got one if you
hadn't helped me.''
Troy scrutinized her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek as lit by the candles,
and watched each varying shade thereon, and the
white shell-like sinuosities of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little ear. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took
out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) purse and was insisting to Boldwood on paying
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways
entered the tent. Troy trembled: here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) scheme
for respectability endangered at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was about
to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hole of espial, attempt to follow Pennyways,
and find out if the ex-bailiff had recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was arrested by the conversation, and found he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was
too late.
``Excuse me, ma'am.'' said Pennyways; ``I've some
private information for your ear alone.<div class="bookquote">''
I cannot hear it now.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said, coldly. That
Bathsheba could not endure this man was evident; in
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was continually coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) with some tale
or other, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might creep into favour at the
expense of persons maligned.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll write it down.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pennyways</b></font>)</div>said Pennyways, confidently. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
stooped over the table, pulled a leaf from a warped
pocket-book, and wrote upon the paper, in a round
hand --
<div class="bookquote">``YOUR husband is here. I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Who's the fool
now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>This he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folded small, and handed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).
Bathsheba would not read it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) would not even put
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand to take it. Pennyways, then, with a laugh
of derision, tossed it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) lap, and, turning away,
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).
From the words and action of Pennyways, Troy,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been able to see what the ex-bailiff
wrote, had not a moment's doubt that the note referred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could think of could be done
to check the exposure. <div class="bookquote">``Curse my luck!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered,
and added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like
a pestilent wind. Meanwhile Boldwood said, taking up
the note from her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) lap --
<div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy? If not,
I'll destroy it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps it is
unjust not to read it; but I can guess what it is about.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wants me to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), or it is to tell me of
some little scandal or another connected with my work-
people. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)'s always doing that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba held the note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) right hand. Bold-
wood handed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) a plate of cut bread-and-
butter; when, in order to take a slice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) put the note
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) left hand, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) was still holding the purse,
and then allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) hand to drop beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) close to
the canvas. The moment had come for saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) game,
and Troy impulsively felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would play the card,
For yet another time he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) looked at the fair hand, and
saw the pink finger-tips, and the blue veins of the
wrist, encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) wore: how familiar it all was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)! Then, with
the lightning action in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was such an adept, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
noiselessly slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand under the bottom of the
tent-cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down,
lifted it a little way, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eye to the hole,
snatched the note from her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) fingers, dropped the canvas,
and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch,
smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart,
hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to
a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again, and
crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance
of the tent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) object was now to get to Pennyways,
and prevent a repetition of the announcement until
such time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) should choose.
Troy reached the tent door, and standing among the
groups there gathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways,
evidently not wishing to make himself prominent by
inquiring for him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). One or two men were speaking of
a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a
young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
It was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of
paper which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand to he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) a bank note,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) had seized it, and made off with it, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
purse behind. His (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) chagrin and disappointment at dis-
covering its worthlessness would be a good joke, it was
said. However, the occurrence seemed to have become
known to few, for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who
had lately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor
the four bowed old men with grim countenances and
walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing <div class="bookquote">``Major
Malley's Reel''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>to the tune. Behind these stood
Pennyways. Troy glided up to him (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>), beckoned, and
whispered a few words; and with a mutual glance of
concurrence the two men went into the night together.




<p/>CHAPTER LI



<p/>BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER


<p/>THE arrangement for getting back again to Weather-
bury had been that Oak should take the place of Poor-
grass in Bathsheba's conveyance and drive her (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) home,
it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph
was suffering from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) old complaint, a multiplying eye,
and was, therefore, hardly trustworthy as coachman and
protector to a woman. But Oak had found himself so
occupied, and was full of so many cares relative to
those portions of Boldwood's flocks that were not
disposed of, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or
anybody, resolved to drive home herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
many times done from Casterbridge Market, and trust
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good angel for performing the journey un-
molested. But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood
accidentally -LRB-on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) part at least-RRB- at the refreshment-
tent, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found it impossible to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) offer to ride
on horseback beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as escort. It had grown
twilight before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was aware, but Boldwood assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that there was no cause for uneasiness, as the
moon would be up in half-an-hour.
Immediately after the incident in the tent, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
risen to go -- now absolutely alarmed and really grateful
for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old lover's protection -- though regretting Gabriel's
absence, whose company she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have much preferred,
as being more proper as well as more pleasant, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)
was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own managing-man and servant. This, how-
ever, could not be helped; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not, on any
consideration, treat Boldwood harshly, having once
already illused him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and the moon having risen, and
the gig being ready, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drove across the hilltop in
the wending way's which led downwards -- to oblivious
obscurity, as it seemed, for the moon and the hill it
flooded with light were in appearance on a level, the
rest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between
them. Boldwood mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) horse, and followed in
close attendance behind. Thus they descended into
the lowlands, and the sounds of those left on the
hill came like voices from the sky, and the lights were
as those of a camp in heaven. They soon passed the
merry stragglers in the immediate vicinity of the hill,
traversed Kingsbere, and got upon the high road.
The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that
the farmer's staunch devotion to herself was still un-
diminished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sympathized deeply. The sight
had quite depressed her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) this evening; had reminded
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) folly; she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) wished anew, as she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had wished
many months ago, for some means of making repara-
tion for her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) fault. Hence her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) pity for the man who
so persistently loved on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own injury and per-
manent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into an injudi-
cious considerateness of manner, which appeared
almost like tenderness, and gave new vigour to the
exquisite dream of a Jacob's seven years service in
poor Boldwood's mind.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) soon found an excuse for advancing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
position in the rear, and rode close by her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) side. They
had gone two or three miles in the moonlight, speaking
desultorily across the wheel of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) gig concerning the
fair, farming, Oak's usefulness to them both, and other
indifferent subjects, when Boldwood said suddenly
and simply --
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Troy, you will marry again some day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>This point-blank query unmistakably confused her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>),
it was not till a minute or more had elapsed that
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have not seriously thought of any such
subject.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I quite understand that. Yet your late husband
has been dead nearly one year, and -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You forget that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death was never absolutely
proved, and may not have taken place; so that I may
not be really a widow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, catching at the straw of
escape that the fact afforded
``Not absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved
circumstantially. A man saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drowning, too. No
reasonable person has any doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death; nor
have you, ma'am, I should imagine.
``O yes I have, or I should have acted differently,''
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, gently. ``From the first, I have had a strange
uaccountable feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have perished,
but I have been able to explain that in several ways
since. Even were I half persuaded that I shall see
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no more, I am far from thinking of marriage with
another. I should be very contemptible to indulge in
such a thought.''
They were silent now awhile, and having struck into
an unfrequented track across a common, the creaks of
Boldwood's saddle and gig springs were all the
sounds to be heard. Boldwood ended the pause.
``Do you remember when I carried you fainting in
my arms into the King's Arms, in Casterbridge? Every
dog has his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) day: that was mine.''
``I know-I know it all.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, hurriedly.
``I, for one, shall never cease regretting that events
so fell out as to deny you to me.''
``I, too, am very sorry.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, and then checked
herself. ``I mean, you know, I am sorry you thought
I -- ''
``I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over
those past times with you -- that I was something to
you before HE (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) was anything, and that you belonged
ALMOST to me. But, of course, that's nothing. You
never liked me.''
``I did; and respected you, too.<div class="bookquote">``Do you now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean which?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you like me, or do you respect me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know -- at least, I cannot tell you. It is
difficult for a woman to define her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feelings in language
which is chiefly made by men to express theirs. My
treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable, wicked!
I shall eternally regret it. If there had been anything
I could have done to make amends I would most
gladly have done it -- there was nothing on earth I so
longed to do as to repair the error. But that was not
possible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't blame yourself -- you were not so far in the
wrong as you suppose. Bathsheba, suppose you had
real complete proof that you are what, in fact, you are
-- a widow -- would you repair the old wrong to me by
marrying me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say. I shouldn't yet, at any rate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you might at some future time of your life?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes, I might at some time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, do you know that without further proof
of any kind you may marry again in about six years
from the present -- subject to nobody's objection or
blame?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said, quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I know all that. But
don't talk of it -- seven or six years -- where may we all
be by that time?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They will soon glide by, and it will seem an
astonishingly short time to look back upon when they
are past -- much less than to look forward to now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now listen once more.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``If I
wait that time, will you marry me? You own that you
owe me amends -- let that be your way of making them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Boldwood -- six years -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to be the wife of any other man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No indeed! I mean, that I don't like to talk
about this matter now. Perhaps it is not proper, and
I ought not to allow it. Let us drop it. My husband
may be living, as I said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I'll drop the subject if you wish. But
propriety has nothing to do with reasons. I am a
middle-aged man, willing to protect you for the
remainder of our lives. On your side, at least, there
is no passion or blamable haste -- on mine, perhaps,
there is. But I can't help seeing that if you choose
from a feeling of pity, and, as you say, a wish to make
amends, to make a bargain with me for a far-ahead
time -- an agreement which will set all things right
and make me happy, late though it may be -- there is
no fault to be found with you as a woman. Hadn't
I the first place beside you? Haven't you been
almost mine once already? Surely you can say to
me as much as this, you will have me back again
should circumstances permit? Now, pray speak! O
Bathsheba, promise -- it is only a little promise -- that
if you marry again, you will marry me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) tone was so excited that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) almost feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
at this moment, even whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) sympathized. It was
a simple physical fear -- the weak of the strong; there
no emotional aversion or inner repugnance. She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
said, with some distress in her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) voice, for she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) remembered
vividly his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank
from a repetition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) anger: --
<div class="bookquote">``I will never marry another man whilst you wish me
to be your wife, whatever comes -- but to say more -- you
have taken me so by surprise -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But let it stand in these simple words -- that in six
years' time you will be my wife? Unexpected accidents
we'll not mention, because those, of course, must be
given way to. Now, this time I know you will keep
your word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's why I hesitate to give it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But do give it! Remember the past, and be kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) breathed; and then said mournfully: <div class="bookquote">``O what
shall I do? I don't love you, and I much fear that I
never shall love you as much as a woman ought to love
a husband. If you, sir, know that, and I can yet give
you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of
six years, if my husband should not come back, it is a
great honour to me. And if you value such an act of
friendship from a woman who doesn't esteem her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)-
self as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, and has little love left, why it
will -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Promise!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'' -- Consider, if I cannot promise soon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But soon is perhaps never?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, it is not! I mean soon. Christmas, we'll
say.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christmas!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said nothing further till he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
added: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll say no more to you about it till that
time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind,
which showed how entirely the soul is the slave of the
body, the ethereal spirit dependent for its quality upon
the tangible flesh and blood. It is hardly too much to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) felt coerced by a force stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
own will, not only into the act of promising upon this
singularly remote and vague matter, but into the emo-
tion of fancying that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) ought to promise. When the
weeks intervening between the night of this conversa-
tion and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish,
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) anxiety and perplexity increased.
One day she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was led by an accident into an oddly
confidential dialogue with Gabriel about her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) difficulty
It afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) a little relief -- of a dull and cheerless
kind. They were auditing accounts, and something
occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak
to say, speaking of Boldwood, <div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)'ll never forget you,
ma'am, never.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Then out came her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) trouble before she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) was aware;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had again got into the toils;
what Boldwood had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>), and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was ex-
pecting her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) assent. <div class="bookquote">``The most mournful reason of all
for my agreeing to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) said sadly, <div class="bookquote">``and the true
reason why I think to do so for good or for evil, is this
-- it is a thing I have not breathed to a living soul as
yet-i believe that if I don't give my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll go out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Really, do ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``I believe this.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) continued, with reckless frank-
ness; <div class="bookquote">``and Heaven knows I say it in a spirit the very
reverse of vain, for I am grieved and troubled to my
soul about it-i believe I hold that man's future in my
hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career depends entirely upon my treatment
of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). O Gabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for
it is terrible!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I think this much, ma'am, as I told you years
ago.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life is a total blank whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) isn't hoping for `ee; but I can't suppose-i hope
that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) natural manner has always been dark and strange,
you know. But since the case is so sad and oddlike,
why don't ye give the conditional promise? I think I
would.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But is it right? Some rash acts of my past life
have taught me that a watched woman must have very
much circumspection to retain only a very little credit,
and I do want and long to be discreet in this! And
six years -- why we may all be in our graves by that
BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH OAK
time, even if Mr. Troy does not come back again, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) may not impossibly do! Such thoughts give a sort
of absurdity to the scheme. Now, isn't it preposterous,
Gabriel? However he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) came to dream of it, I cannot think.
But is it wrong? You know -- you are older than I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eight years older, ma'am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, eight years -- and is it wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a
man and woman to make: I don't see anything really
wrong about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, slowly. <div class="bookquote">``In fact the very
thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en
under any condition, that is, your not caring about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
-- for I may suppose -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
said shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Love is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-
out, miserable thing with me -- for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or any one else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing
that takes away harm from such an agreement with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
If wild heat had to do wi' it, making ye long to over-
come the awkwardness about your husband's vanishing,
it mid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige
a man seems different, somehow. The real sin, ma'am
in my mind, lies in thinking of ever wedding wi' a man
you don't love honest and true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That I'm willing to pay the penalty of.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Bath-
sheba, firmly. <div class="bookquote">``You know, Gabriel, this is what I can-
not get off my conscience -- that I once seriously injured
him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in sheer idleness. If I had never played a trick
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would never have wanted to marry me.
O if I could only pay some heavy damages in money
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) for the harm I did, and so get the sin off my
soul that way!.. Well, there's the debt, which can
only be discharged in one way, and I believe I am
bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power, without
any consideration of my own future at all. When a
rake gambles away his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) expectations, the fact that it is
an inconvenient debt doesn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) the less liable.
I've been a rake, and the single point I ask you is, con-
sidering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the
eye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep
any man from marrying me until seven years have
passed -- am I free to entertain such an idea, even
though `tis a sort of penance -- for it will be that? I
hate the act of marriage under such circumstances, and
the class of women I should seem to belong to by doing
it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you
think, as everybody else do, that your husband is
dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall get to, I suppose, because I cannot help
feeling what would have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back long before
this time if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had lived.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, in religious sense you will be as free
to THINK o' marrying again as any real widow of one
year's standing. But why don't ye ask Mr. Thirdly's
advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. When I want a broad-minded opinion for
general enlightenment, distinct from special advice, I
never go to a man who deals in the subject pro-
fessionally. So I like the parson's opinion on law, the
lawyer's on doctoring, the doctor's on business, and my
business-man's -- that is, yours -- on morals.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And on love -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said
Oak, with a grave smile.
She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) did not reply at once, and then saying, <div class="bookquote">``Good
evening Mr. Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>went away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor ex-
pected any reply from Gabriel more satisfactory than
that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had obtained. Yet in the centremost parts of
her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) complicated heart there existed at this minute a
little pang of disappointment, for a reason she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) would
not allow herself to recognize. Oak had not once
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) free that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might marry her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) himself -- had
not once said, <div class="bookquote">``I could wait for you as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was the insect sting. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) would have
listened to any such hypothesis. O no -- for wasn't
she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) saying all the time that such thoughts of the future
were improper, and wasn't Gabriel far too poor a man
to speak sentiment to her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)? Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might have just
hinted about that old love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and asked, in a playful
off-hand way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) might speak of it. It would have
seemed pretty and sweet, if no more; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>)
would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman's
<div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>can sometimes be. But to give such cool advice
-- the very advice she (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had asked for -- it ruffled our
heroine all the afternoon.




<p/>CHAPTER LII



<p/>CONVERGING COURSES


<p/>I
CHRISTMAS-EVE came, and a party that Boldwood
was to give in the evening was the great subject of talk
in Weatherbury. It was not that the rarity of Christmas
parties in the parish made this one a wonder, but that
Boldwood should be the giver. The announcement
had had an abnormal and incongruous sound, as if one
should hear of croquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or
that some much-respected judge was going upon the
stage. That the party was intended to be a truly jovial
one there was no room for doubt. A large bough of
mistletoe had been brought from the woods that day, and
suspended in the hall of the bachelor's home. Holly
and ivy had followed in armfuls. From six that morning
till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared
and sparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and
the threelegged pot appearing in the midst of the flames
like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; moreover,
roasting and basting operations were continually
carried on in front of the genial blaze.
As it grew later the fire was made up in the large
long hall into which the staircase descended, and all
encumbrances were cleared out for dancing. The log
which was to form the back-brand of the evening fire
was the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could
be neither brought nor rolled to its place; and accord-
ingly two men were to be observed dragging and heaving
it in by chains and levers as the hour of assembly drew
near.

In spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting
In the atmosphere of the house. Such a thing had
never been attempted before by its owner, and it was
now done as by a wrench. Intended gaieties would
insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the organ-
ization of the whole effort was carried out coldly, by
hirelings, and a shadow seemed to move about the
rooms, saying that the proceedings were unnatural to
the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence
not good.
Bathsheba was at this time in her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) room, dressing for
the event. She (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had called for candles, and Liddy
entered and placed one on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) mistress's
glass.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't go away, Liddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, almost
timidly.<div class="bookquote">'' I am foolishly agitated-i cannot tell why.
I wish I had not been obliged to go to this dance; but
there's no escaping now. I have not spoken to Mr.
Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) at Christmas on business, but I had no idea there
was to be anything of this kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I would go now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy, who was going
with her (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>); for Boldwood had been indiscriminate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
invitations.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said
Bathsheba.<div class="bookquote">'' But I am THE CAUSE of the party, and that
upsets me! -- Don't tell, Liddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, ma'am, You the cause of it, ma'am?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I am the reason of the party-i. If it had
not been for me, there would never have been one. I
can't explain any more -- there's no more to be explained.
I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's wicked of you -- to wish to be worse off than
you are.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Liddy. I have never been free from trouble
since I have lived here, and this party is likely to bring
me more. Now, fetch my black silk dress, and see how
it sits upon me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you will leave off that, surely, ma'am? You
have been a widowlady fourteen months, and ought to
brighten up a little on such a night as this.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it necessary? No; I will appear as usual, for if
I were to wear any light dress people would say things
about me, and I should seem to he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rejoicing when I am
solemn all the time. The party doesn't suit me a bit;
but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>III
Boldwood was dressing also at this hour. A tailor
from Casterbridge was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), assisting him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) in the
operation of trying on a new coat that had just been
brought home.
Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable
about the fit, and generally difficult to please. The
tailor walked round and round him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>), tugged at the waist,
pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar, and for the
first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) experience Boldwood was not bored-
Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against
all such niceties as childish, but now no philosophic or
hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for
attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat
as to an earthquake in South America. Boldwood at
last expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill,
the tailor passing out of the door just as Oak came in
to report progress for the day.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood. <div class="bookquote">``I shall of course see
you here to-night. Make yourself merry. I am deter-
mined that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not
be very early.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad indeed
to see such a change in `ee from what it used to be.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes-i must own it-i am bright to-night: cheerful
and more than cheerful-so much so that I am almost
sad again with the sense that all of it is passing away.
And sometimes, when I am excessively hopeful and
blithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I
often get to look upon gloom in me with content, and
to fear a happy mood. Still this may be absurd-i feel
that it is absurd. Perhaps my day is dawning at last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope it `ill be a long and a fair one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you -- thank you. Yet perhaps my cheerful
mess rests on a slender hope. And yet I trust my hope.
It is faith, not hope. I think this time I reckon with
my host. -- Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or some-
thing; I can't tie this neckerchief properly. Perhaps
you will tie it for me. The fact is, I have not been well
lately, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear that, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's nothing. I want it done as well as you can,
please. Is there any late knot in fashion, Oak?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) tone had sunk to
sadness.
Boldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the
neckerchief the farmer went on feverishly --
<div class="bookquote">``Does a woman keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise, Gabriel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If it is not inconvenient to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''-- Or rather an implied promise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't answer for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) implying.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, with
faint bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``That's a word as full o' holes as a
sieve with them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak, don't talk like that. You have got quite
cynical lately -- how is it? We seem to have shifted our
positions: I have become the young and hopeful man,
and you the old and unbelieving one. However, does
a woman keep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on
an engagement to marry at some time? Now you
know women better than I -- tell me.''
``I am afeard you honour my understanding too much.
However, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may keep such a promise, if it is made
with an honest meaning to repair a wrong.''
``It has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon --
yes, I know it will.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in an impulsive whisper.
``I have pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) upon the subject, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inclines
to be kind to me, and to think of me as a husband at
a long future time, and that's enough for me. How
can I expect more? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has a notion that a woman
should not marry within seven years of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's
disappearance -- that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own self shouldn't, I mean --
because his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) body was not found. It may be merely
this legal reason which influences her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or it may be a
religious one, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is reluctant to talk on the point-
Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has promised -- implied -- that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will ratify an
engagement to-night.''
``Seven years.'' murmured Oak.
``No, no -- it's no such thing!<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with im-
patience. Five years, nine months, and a few days.
Fifteen months nearly have passed since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanished,
and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of
little more than five years?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems long in a forward view. Don't build too
much upon such promises, sir. Remember, you have
once be'n deceived. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meaning may be good; but
there -- she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s young yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Deceived? Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood, vehemently.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never promised me at that first time, and hence
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not break her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise! If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promises me,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll marry me, Bathsheba is a woman to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div>IV
Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart
tavern at Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming
mixture from a glass. A knock was given at the door,
and Pennyways entered.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Troy inquired, pointing
to a chair.
<div class="bookquote">``Boldwood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No -- Lawyer Long.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) wadn' at home. I went there first, too.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That's a nuisance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis rather, I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yet I don't see that, because a man appears to be
drowned and was not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be liable for anything.
I shan't ask any lawyer -- not I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But that's not it, exactly. If a man changes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
name and so forth, and takes steps to deceive the world
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a cheat, and that in the eye of
the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless a lammocken
vagabond; and that's a punishable situation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha-ha! Well done, Pennyways.''  (<font color='red'><b>Troy/Mrs. Troy</b></font>)</div>Troy had laughed,
but it was with some anxiety that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, what
I want to know is this, do you think there's really
anything going on between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Boldwood? Upon
my soul, I should never have believed it! How she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
must detest me! Have you found out whether she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
has encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I haen't been able to learn. There's a deal of
feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) side seemingly, but I don't answer for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I didn't know a word about any such thing till
yesterday, and all I heard then was that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was gwine
to the party at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) house to-night. This is the first
time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has ever gone there, they say. And they say
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ve not so much as spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) since they were
at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk believe o`t? How-
ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s not fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) -- quite offish and quite care
less, I know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm not so sure of that... She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a handsome
woman, Pennyways, is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) not? Own that you never
saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life.
Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that day
I wondered what I could have been made of to be able
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by herself so long. And then I was
hampered with that bothering show, which I'm free of
at last, thank the stars.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) smoked on awhile, and
then added, <div class="bookquote">``How did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) look when you passed by
yesterday?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took no great heed of me, ye may well
fancy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked well enough, far's I know. Just
flashed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) haughty eyes upon my poor scram body, and
then let them go past me to what was yond, much as if
I'd been no more than a leafless tree. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had just got
off her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mare to look at the last wring-down of cider for
the year; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been riding, and so her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) colours were
up and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) breath rather quick, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bosom
plimmed and feli-plimmed and feli-every time plain
to my eye. Ay, and there were the fellers round her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
wringing down the cheese and bustling about and
saying, Ware o' the pommy, ma'am: `twill spoil yer
gown. ``Never mind me,'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>). Then Gabe
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) some of the new cider, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) must
needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not in
a nateral way at all. ``Liddy,'' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), ``bring indoors
a few gallons, and I'll make some cider-wine.<div class="bookquote">'' Sergeant,
I was no more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) than a morsel of scroffin the fuel
house!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must go and find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out at once -- O yes, I see
that-i must go. Oak is head man still, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, 'a b`lieve. And at Little Weatherbury Farm
too. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manages everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Twill puzzle him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), or any other man
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) compass!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about that. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can't do without
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and knowing it well he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s pretty independent.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ve a few soft corners to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, though
I've never been able to get into one, the devil's in't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah baily she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a notch above you, and you must
own it: a higher class of animal-a finer tissue. How-
ever, stick to me, and neither this haughty goddess,
dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine -LRB-Juno
was a goddess, you know-RRB-, nor anybody else shall hurt
you. But all this wants looking into, I perceive.
What with one thing and another, I see that my work
is well cut out for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>V
<div class="bookquote">``How do I look to-night, Liddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba,
giving a final adjustment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) dress before leaving the
glass.
<div class="bookquote">``I never saw you look so well before. Yes-i'll tell
you when you looked like it -- that night, a year and a
half ago, when you came in so wildlike, and scolded us
for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Everybody will think that I am setting myself to
captivate Mr. Boldwood, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) murmured.
``At least they'll say so. Can't my hair be brushed
down a little flatter? I dread going -- yet I dread the
risk of wounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) by staying away.``Anyhow, ma'am, you can't well be
dressed plainer
than you are, unless you go in sackcloth at once. <div class="bookquote">``Tis
your excitement is what makes you look so noticeable
to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I don't know what's the matter, I feel wretched at
one time, and buoyant at another. I wish I could have
continued quite alone as I have been for the last year
or so, with no hopes and no fears, and no pleasure and
no grief.
``Now just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you
-- only just suppose it -- to run away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), what
would you do, ma'am?''
``Liddy -- none of that.'' said Bathsheba, gravely.
``Mind, I won't hear joking on any such matter. Do
you hear?''
``I beg pardon, ma'am. But knowing what rum
things we women be, I just said -- however, I won't
speak of it again.''
``No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever,
<div class="bookquote">``twill be for reasons very, very different from those you
think, or others will believe! Now get my cloak, for it
is time to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>VI
``Oak, said Boldwood, ``before you go I want to
mention what has been passing in my mind lately --
that little arrangement we made about your share in the
farm I mean. That share is small, too small, consider-
ing how little I attend to business now, and how much
time and thought you give to it. Well, since the world
is brightening for me, I want to show my sense of it
by increasing your proportion in the partnership. I'll
make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck
me as likely to be convenient, for I haven't time to talk
about it now; and then we'll discuss it at our leisure.
My intention is ultimately to retire from the manage-
ment altogether, and until you can take all the expendi-
ture upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping partner in
the stock. Then, if I marry her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) -- and I hope-i feel I
shall, why -- -- ''
``Pray don't speak of it, sir.'' said Oak, hastily. ``We
don't know what may happen. So many upsets may
befall `ee. There's many a slip, as they say -- and I
would advise you-i know you'll pardon me this once --
not to be TOO SURE.''
``I know, I know. But the feeling I have about in-
creasing your share is on account of what I know of you
Oak, I have learnt a little about your secret: your
interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is more than that of bailiff for an em-
ployer. But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a
sort of successful rival-successful partly through your
goodness of heart -- should like definitely to show my
sense of your friendship under what must have been a
great pain to you.''
``O that's not necessary, thank `ee.'' said Oak,
hurriedly. ``I must get used to such as that; other
men have, and so shall I.''
Oak then left him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) was uneasy on Boldwood's
account, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) saw anew that this constant passion
of the farmer made him (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) not the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) once had
been.
As Boldwood continued awhile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) room alone --
ready and dressed to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) company -- the mood of
anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) appearance seemed to pass away, and
to be succeeded by a deep solemnity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) looked out
of the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees
upon the sky, and the twilight deepening to darkness.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) went to a locked closet, and took from
a locked drawer therein a small circular case the size of
a pillbox, and was about to put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) pocket. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lingered to open the cover and take a momentary
glance inside. It contained a woman's finger-ring, set
all the way round with small diamonds, and from its
appearance had evidently been recently purchased.
Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long
time, though that its material aspect concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
little was plain from his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) manner and mien, which were
those of a mind following out the presumed thread of
that jewel's future history.
The noise of wheels at the front of the house became
audible. Boldwood closed the box, stowed it away
carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) pocket, and went out upon the landing.
The old man who was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indoor factotum came at the
same moment to the foot of the stairs.
``They be coming, sir -- lots of 'em -- a-foot and a-
driving!''
``I was coming down this moment. Those wheels I
heard -- is it Mrs. Troy?''
``No, sir -- `tis not she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) yet.''
A reserved and sombre expression had returned to
Boldwood's face again, but it poorly cloaked his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) feel-
ings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) pronounced Bathsheba's name; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a
galloping motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) fingers upon the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thigh
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) went down the stairs.

``How does this cover me?'' said Troy to Pennyways,
``Nobody would recognize me now, I'm sure.''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of
Noachian cut, with cape and high collar, the latter being
erect and rigid, like a girdling wall, and nearly reaching
to the verge of travelling cap which was pulled down
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) ears.
Pennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up
and deliberately inspected Troy
``You've made up your mind to go then?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
said.
``Made up my mind? Yes; of course I have.''
``Why not write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)? <div class="bookquote">``Tis a very queer corner
that you have got into, sergeant. You see all these things
will come to light if you go back, and they won't sound
well at all. Faith, if I was you I'd even bide as you be
-- a single man of the name of Francis. A good wife is
good, but the best wife is not so good as no wife at all.
Now that's my outspoke mind, and I've been called a
long-headed feller here and there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Troy, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``There she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is
with plenty of money, and a house and farm, and
horses, and comfort, and here am I living from hand to
mouth -- a needy adventurer. Besides, it is no use
talking now; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I've been
seen and recognized here this very afternoon. I should
have gone back to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the day after the fair, if it hadn't
been for you talking about the law, and rubbish about
getting a separation; and I don't put it off any longer.
What the deuce put it into my head to run away at all,
I can't think! Humbugging sentiment -- that's what it
was. But what man on earth was to know that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife
would be in such a hurry to get rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should have known it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s bad enough for
anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pennyways, mind who you are talking to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I'd
go abroad again where I came from -- `tisn't too late to do
it now. I wouldn't stir up the business and get a bad
name for the sake of living with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) -- for all that about
your play-acting is sure to come out, you know, although
you think otherwise. My eyes and limbs, there'll be a
racket if you go back just now -- in the middle of Bold-
wood's Christmasing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``H'm, yes. I expect I shall not be a very welcome
guest if he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there.''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, with a slight
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``A sort of Alonzo the Brave; and when I go in
the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter
and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the
chamber burn blue, and the worms -- Ugh, horrible! --
Ring for some more brandy, Pennyways, I felt an
awful shudder just then! Well, what is there besides?
A stick-i must have a walking-stick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pennyways</b></font>)</div>Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a
difficulty, for should Bathsheba and Troy become recon-
ciled it would be necessary to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) good opinion
if he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) would secure the patronage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) husband. I
sometimes think she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) likes you yet, and is a good woman
at bottom.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) said, as a saving sentence. ``But there's
no telling to a certainty from a body's outside. Well,
you'll do as you like about going, of course, sergeant,
and as for me, I'll do as you tell me.''
``Now, let me see what the time is.'' said Troy, after
emptying his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) glass in one draught as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) stood. <div class="bookquote">``Half-
past six o'clock. I shall not hurry along the road, and
shall be there then before nine.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LIII



<p/>CONCURRITUR -- HORAE MOMENTO


<p/>OUTSIDE the front of Boldwood's house a group of
men stood in the dark, with their faces towards the door,
which occasionally opened and closed for the passage of
some guest or servant, when a golden rod of light would
stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again,
leaving nothing outside but the glowworm shine of the
pale lamp amid the evergreens over the door.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon -- so the
boy said.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one of them remarked in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``And l
for one believe it. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) body was never found, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">''`Tis a strange story.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the next. <div class="bookquote">``You may
depend upon't that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows nothing about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) don't mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shall.''  (<font color='red'><b>another man</b></font>)</div>said another
man.
<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s alive and here in the neighbourhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
means mischief.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the first. <div class="bookquote">``Poor young thing:
I do pity her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), if `tis true. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll drag her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to the dogs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll settle down quiet enough.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one
disposed to take a more hopeful view of the case.
<div class="bookquote">``What a fool she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must have been ever to have had
anything to do with the man! She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is so self-willed and
independent too, that one is more minded to say it
serves her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) right than pity her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no. I don't hold with `ee there. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was no
otherwise than a girl mind, and how could she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tell what
the man was made of? If `tis really true, `tis too hard
a punishment, and more than she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ought to hae. -- Hullo,
who's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was to some footsteps that were
heard approaching.
<div class="bookquote">``William Smallbury.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a dim figure in the shades,
coming up and joining them. <div class="bookquote">``Dark as a hedge, to-
night, isn't it? I all but missed the plank over the river
ath`art there in the bottom -- never did such a thing
before in my life. Be ye any of Boldwood's workfolk?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peered into their faces.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes -- all o' us. We met here a few minutes ago.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hear now -- that's Sam Samway: thought I
knowed the voice, too. Going in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Presently. But I say, William.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>Samway whispered,
<div class="bookquote">``have ye heard this strange tale?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What -- that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye
mean, souls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Smallbury, also lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``Ay: in Casterbridge.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have. Laban Tall named a hint of it to me
but now -- but I don't think it. Hark, here Laban
comes himself, 'a b`lieve.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A footstep drew near.
<div class="bookquote">``Laban?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, `tis I.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``Have ye heard any more about that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall, joining the group. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm in-
clined to think we'd better keep quiet. If so be `tis not
true, `twill flurry her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>), and do her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) much harm to repeat
it; and if so be `tis true, `twill do no good to forestall
her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) time o' trouble. God send that it mid be a lie, for
though Henery Fray and some of 'em do speak against
her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)'s never been anything but fair to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)'s
hot and hasty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)'s a brave girl who'll never tell a
lie however much the truth may harm her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>), and I've no
cause to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) evil.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) never do tell women's little lies, that's true; and
`tis a thing that can be said of very few. Ay, all the
harm she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) says to yer face: there's nothing
underhand wi' her (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>every man</b></font>)</div>They stood silent then, every man busied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own thoughts, during which interval sounds of merri-
ment could be heard within. Then the front door again
opened, the rays streamed out, the wellknown form of
Boldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light, the
door closed, and Boldwood walked slowly down the path.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis master.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>one of the men whispered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) neared
them. ``We'd better stand quiet -- he (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)'ll go in again
directly. He (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>) would think it unseemly o' us to be
loitering here.
Boldwood came on, and passed by the men without
seeing them, they being under the bushes on the grass.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) paused, leant over the gate, and breathed a long
breath. They heard low words come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
``I hope to God she (<font color='blue'><b>ye</b></font>)'ll come, or this night will be
nothing but misery to me! O my darling, my darling,
why do you keep me in suspense like this?''
He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard
it. Boldwood remained silent after that, and the noise
from indoors was again just audible, until, a few minutes
later, light wheels could be distinguished coming down
the hill. They drew nearer, and ceased at the gate.
Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it;
and the light shone upon Bathsheba coming up the
path.
Boldwood compressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) emotion to mere welcome:
the men marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) light laugh and apology as she (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) into the house; and the door closed
again.
``Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with
him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!'' said one of the men. ``I thought that fancy of
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was over long ago.
<div class="bookquote">``You don't know much of master, if you thought
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>said Samway.
<div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should know we heard what 'a said
for the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remarked a third.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish we had told of the report at once.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the first
uneasily continued. <div class="bookquote">``More harm may come of this than
we know of. Poor Mr. Boldwood, it will, be hard upon
en. I wish Troy was in -- -- Well, God forgive me
for such a wish! A scoundrel to play a poor wife such
tricks. Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
came here. And now I've no heart to go in. Let's
look into Warren's for a few minutes first, shall us,
neighbours?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Samway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren's,
and went out at the gate, the remaining ones entering
the house. The three soon drew near the malt-house,
approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and not by
way of the street. The pane of glass was illuminated
as usual. Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest
when, pausing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) turned suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) companions
and said, <div class="bookquote">``Hist! See there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>The light from the pane was now perceived to be
shining not upon the ivied wall as usual, but upon some
object close to the glass. It was a human face.
<div class="bookquote">``Let's come closer.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whispered Samway; and they
approached on tiptoe. There was no disbelieving the
report any longer. Troy's face was almost close to the
pane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) was looking in. Not only was he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) looking in,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) appeared to have been arrested by a conversation
which was in progress in the malt-house, the voices of
the interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster.
<div class="bookquote">``The spree is all in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) honour, isn't it -- hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said
the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Although he (<font color='blue'><b>Warren</b></font>) made believe `tis only
keeping up o' Christmas?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``O `tis true enough, faith. I cannot understand
Farmer Boldwood being such a fool at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) time of life
as to ho and hanker after thik woman in the way 'a do,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) not care a bit about en.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew
across the orchard as quietly as they had come. The
air was big with Bathsheba's fortunes to-night: every
word everywhere concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>). When they were quite
out of earshot all by one instinct paused.
<div class="bookquote">``It gave me quite a turn -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) face.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall,
breathing.
<div class="bookquote">``And so it did me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>said Samway. <div class="bookquote">``What's to be
done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that `tis any business of ours.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>Smallbury
murmured dubiously.
``But it is! ``Tis a thing which is everybody's business,
said Samway. <div class="bookquote">``We know very well that master's on a
wrong tack, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s quite in the dark, and we
should let 'em know at once. Laban, you know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
best -- you'd better go and ask to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I bain't fit for any such thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laban</b></font>)</div>said Laban, nervously.
<div class="bookquote">``I should think William ought to do it if anybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)'s
oldest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall have nothing to do with it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Smallbury.
<div class="bookquote">''`Tis a ticklish business altogether. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)'ll go on
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) himself in a few minutes, ye'll see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) will. Come, Laban.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well, if I must I must, I suppose.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tall reluct-
antly answered. <div class="bookquote">``What must I say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just ask to see master.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no; I shan't speak to Mr. Boldwood. If I tell
anybody, `twill be mistress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>said Samway.
Laban then went to the door. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) opened it
the hum of bustle rolled out as a wave upon a still
strand -- the assemblage being immediately inside the
hall-and was deadened to a murmur as he (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) closed it
again. Each man waited intently, and looked around at
the dark tree tops gently rocking against the sky and
occasionally shivering in a slight wind, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took
interest in the scene, which neither did. One of them
began walking up and down, and then came to where
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started from and stopped again, with a sense that
walking was thing not worth doing now.
<div class="bookquote">``I should think Laban must have seen mistress by
this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Smallbury, breaking the silence. <div class="bookquote">``Per-
haps she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) won't come and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The door opened. Tall appeared, and joined them
<div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said both.
<div class="bookquote">``I didn't like to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) after all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laban</b></font>)</div>Laban faltered
out. <div class="bookquote">``They were all in such a stir, trying to put a little
spirit into the party. Somehow the fun seems to hang
fire, though everything's there that a heart can desire,
and I couldn't for my soul interfere and throw damp
upon it -- if 'twas to save my life, I couldn't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we had better all go in together.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>said
Samway, gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may have a chance of
saying a word to master.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>So the men entered the hall, which was the room
selected and arranged for the gathering because of its
size. The younger men and maids were at last just
beginning to dance. Bathsheba had been perplexed
how to act, for she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was not much more than a slim
young maid herself, and the weight of stateliness sat
heavy upon her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ought
not to have come under any circumstances; then she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
considered what cold unkindness that would have been,
and finally resolved upon the middle course of staying
for about an hour only, and gliding off unobserved,
having from the first made up her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could
on no account dance, sing, or take any active part in
the proceedings.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) allotted hour having been passed in chatting
and looking on, Bathsheba told Liddy not to hurry her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)-
self, and went to the small parlour to prepare for
departure, which, like the hall, was decorated with holly
and ivy, and well lighted up.
Nobody was in the room, but she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had hardly
been there a moment when the master of the house
entered.
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Troy -- you are not going?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``We've
hardly begun!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``If you'll excuse me, I should like to go now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
manner was restive, for she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) promise,
and imagined what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was about to say. <div class="bookquote">``But as it is
not late.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I can walk home, and leave my
man and Liddy to come when they choose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking
to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood. <div class="bookquote">``You know perhaps what I
long to say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba silently looked on the floor.
<div class="bookquote">``You do give it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said, eagerly.
<div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) whispered.
<div class="bookquote">``Now, that's evasion! Why, the promise. I don't
want to intrude upon you at all, or to let it become
known to anybody. But do give your word! A
mere business compact, you know, between two people
who are beyond the influence of passion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood
knew how false this picture was as regarded himself;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had proved that it was the only tone in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``A promise to
marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.
You owe it to me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I feel that I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba; <div class="bookquote">``that is, if you
demand it. But I am a changed woman -- an unhappy
woman -- and not -- not -- -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>``You are still a very beautiful woman, said Boldwood.
Honesty and pure conviction suggested the remark,
unaccompanied by any perception that it might have
been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
However, it had not much effect now, for for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said,
in a passionless murmur which was in itself a proof of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words: ``I have no feeling in the matter at all.
And I don't at all know what is right to do in my
diddicult position, and I have nobody to advise me. But
I give my promise, if I must. I give it as the rendering of
a debt, conditionally, of course, on my being a widow.''
``You'll marry me between five and six years hence?''
``Don't press me too hard. I'll marry nobody
else.''
``But surely you will name the time, or there's nothing
in the promise at all?<div class="bookquote">''
O, I don't know, pray let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
bosom beginning to rise. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid what to do!
want to be just to you, and to be that seems to be wrong-
ing myself, and perhaps it is breaking the commandments.
There is considerable doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) death, and then it
is dreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I
ought or no!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be
dismissed; a blissful loving intimacy of six years, and
then marriage -- O Bathsheba, say them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) begged in
a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere
friendship any longer. <div class="bookquote">``Promise yourself to me; I
deserve it, indeed I do, for I have loved you more than
anybody in the world! And if I said hasty words and
showed uncalled-for heat of manner towards you, believe
me, dear, I did not mean to distress you; I was in
agony, Bathsheba, and I did not know what I said.
You wouldn't let a dog suffer what I have suffered,
could you but know it! Sometimes I shrink from your
knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am
distressed that all of it you never will know. Be
gracious, and give up a little to me, when I would give
up my life for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The trimmings of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) dress, as they quivered against
the light, showed how agitated she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
burst out crying. <div class="bookquote">``And you'll not -- press me -- about
anything more -- if I say in five or six years?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
sobbed, when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had power to frame the words.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, then I'll leave it to time.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. If he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does not return, I'll marry you
in six years from this day, if we both live.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said
solemnly.
<div class="bookquote">``And you'll take this as a token from me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>Boldwood had come close to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) side, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
clasped one of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hands in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) own, and lifted it
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) breast.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it? Oh I cannot wear a ring!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ex-
claimed, on seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) held; <div class="bookquote">``besides, I wouldn't
have a soul know that it's an engagement! Perhaps it
is improper? Besides, we are not engaged in the usual
sense, are we? Don't insist, Mr. Boldwood -- don't!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) trouble at not being able to get her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) stamped passionately on the floor
with one foot, and tears crowded to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eyes again.
<div class="bookquote">``It means simply a pledge -- no sentiment -- the seal
of a practical compact.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said more quietly, but still
retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) firm grasp. <div class="bookquote">``Come, now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>And Boldwood slipped the ring on her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) finger.
<div class="bookquote">``I cannot wear it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, weeping as if her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heart
would break. <div class="bookquote">``You frighten me, almost. So wild a
scheme! Please let me go home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) face
in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) handkerchief, though Boldwood kept her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand
yet. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, in a sort of hopeless whisper --
<div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so
earnestly. Now loosen my hand; I will, indeed I will
wear it to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret
courtship of six years, with a wedding at the end?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said, fairly beaten into non-resistance.
Boldwood pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hand, and allowed it to drop
in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lap. <div class="bookquote">``I am happy now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``God bless
you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) left the room, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) might
be sufficiently composed sent one of the maids to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
Bathsheba cloaked the effects of the late scene as she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
best could, followed the girl, and in a few moments
came downstairs with her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hat and cloak on, ready to go.
To get to the door it was necessary to pass through the
hall, and before doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) paused on the bottom of
the staircase which descended into one corner, to take
a last look at the gathering.
There was no music or dancing in progress just now.
At the lower end, which had been arranged for the work-
folk specially, a group conversed in whispers, and with
clouded looks. Boldwood was standing by the fireplace,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), too, though so absorbed in visions arising from
her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) scarcely saw anything, seemed at
that moment to have observed their peculiar manner,
and their looks askance.
<div class="bookquote">``What is it you are in doubt about, men?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said.
One of them turned and replied uneasily: <div class="bookquote">``It was
something Laban heard of, that's all, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``News? Anybody married or engaged, born or
dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>inquired the farmer, gaily. <div class="bookquote">``Tell it to us, Tall.
One would think from your looks and mysterious ways
that it was something very dreadful indeed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, sir, nobody is dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``I wish somebody was.''  (<font color='red'><b>Samway</b></font>)</div>said Samway, in a whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you say, Samway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>asked Boldwood, some-
what sharply. <div class="bookquote">``If you have anything to say, speak out;
if not, get up another dance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Troy has come downstairs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Samway to
Tall. <div class="bookquote">``If you want to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), you had better do it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what they mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>the farmer asked
Bathsheba, across the room.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't in the least,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba.
There was a smart rapping at the door. One of
the men opened it instantly, and went outside.
<div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Troy is wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said, on returning.
<div class="bookquote">``Quite ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba. <div class="bookquote">``Though I didn't
tell them to send.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a stranger, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man by the door.
<div class="bookquote">``A stranger?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to come in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Boldwood/Mr. Boldwood/BOLDWOOD</b></font>)</div>said Boldwood.
The message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eyes as we have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), stood in the doorway.
There was an unearthly silence, all looking towards
the newcomer. Those who had just learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>)
was in the neighbourhood recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) instantly;
those who did not were perplexed. Nobody noted
Bathsheba. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was leaning on the stairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brow
had heavily contracted; her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) whole face was pallid, her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
lips apart, her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eyes rigidly staring at their visitor.
Boldwood was among those who did not notice that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was Troy. <div class="bookquote">``Come in, come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) repeated,
cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``and drain a Christmas beaker with us,
stranger!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Troy next advanced into the middle of the room,
took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) cap, turned down his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) coat-collar, and looked
Boldwood in the face. Even then Boldwood did not
recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's persistent
irony towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), who had once before broken in
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) bliss, scourged him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) delight
away, had come to do these things a second time.
Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh: Boldwood
recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) now.
Troy turned to Bathsheba. The poor girl's wretched-
ness at this time was beyond all fancy or narration.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had sunk down on the lowest stair; and there
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth blue and dry, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark eyes
fixed vacantly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wondered whether it
were not all a terrible illusion.
Then Troy spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Bathsheba, I come here for
you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made no reply.
``Come home with me: come!
Bathsheba moved her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) feet a little, but did not rise.
Troy went across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).
``Come, madam, do you hear what I say?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) said,
peremptorily.
A strange voice came from the fireplace -- a voice
sounding far off and confined, as if from a dungeon.
Hardly a soul in the assembly recognized the thin tones
to be those of Boldwood. Sudden dispaire had trans-
formed him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
``Bathsheba, go with your husband!''
Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not move. The truth was
that Bathsheba was beyond the pale of activity -- and
yet not in a swoon. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was in a state of mental GUTTA
SERENA; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind was for the minute totally deprived of
light at the same time no obscuration was apparent
from without.
Troy stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand to pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>),
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) quickly shrank back. This visible dread of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) seemed to irritate Troy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) arm and
pulled it sharply. Whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) grasp pinched her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), or
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) mere touch was the 'cause, was never known,
but at the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) seizure she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) writhed, and gave
a quick, low scream.
The scream had been heard but a few seconds When
it was followed by sudden deafening report that
echoed through the room and stupefied them all. The
oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place
was filled with grey smoke.
In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) back, as stood before the fireplace, was a gun-
rack, as is usual in farmhouses, constructed to hold two
guns. When Bathsheba had cried out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) husband's
grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had changed.
The veins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had turned quickly, taken one of the
guns, cocked it, and at once discharged it at Troy.
Troy fell. The distance apart of the two men was
so small that the charge of shot did not spread in the
least, but passed like a bullet into his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) body. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) uttered
a long guttural sigh -- there was a contraction -- an exten-
sion -- then his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) muscles relaxed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) lay still.
Boldwood was seen through the smoke to be now
again engaged with the gun. It was double-barrelled,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had, meanwhile, in some way fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hand-
kerchief to the trigger, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) foot on the other
end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon
himself. Samway his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) man was the first to see this, and
in the midst of the general horror darted up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
Boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief, and
the gun exploded a second time, sending its contents,
by a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which
crossed the ceiling.
``Well, it makes no difference!'' Boldwood gasped.
<div class="bookquote">``There is another way for me to die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) broke from Samway, crossed the room to
Bathsheba, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) hat,
opened the door, and went into the darkness, nobody
thinking of preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).




<p/>CHAPTER LIV



<p/>AFTER THE SHOCK


<p/>BOLDWOOD passed into the high road and turned
in the direction of Casterbridge. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) walked at
an even, steady pace over Yalbury Hill, along the dead
level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and between
eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.
The streets were nearly deserted now, and the waving
lamp-flames only lighted up rows of grey shop-shutters,
and strips of white paving upon which his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) step echoed
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) passed along. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) turned to the right, and halted
before an archway of heavy stonework, which was closed
by an iron studded pair of doors. This was the entrance
to the gaol, and over it a lamp was fixed, the light en-
abling the wretched traveller to find a bellpull.
The small wicket at last opened, and a porter
appeared. Boldwood stepped forward, and said some-
thing in a low tone, when, after a delay, another man
came. Boldwood entered, and the door was closed
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) walked the world no more.
Long before this time Weatherbury had been
thoroughly aroused, and the wild deed which had ter-
minated Boldwood's merrymaking became known to
all. Of those out of the house Oak was one of the
first to hear of the catastrophe, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) entered
the room, which was about five minutes after Boldwood's
exit, the scene was terrible. All the female guests were
huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm,
and the men were bewildered as to what to do. As for
Bathsheba, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was sitting on the
floor beside the body of Troy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) head pillowed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
lap, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had herself lifted it. With one hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) handkerchief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) breast and covered the
wound, though scarcely a single drop of blood had
flowed, and with the other she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) tightly clasped one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>). The household convulsion had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) herself
again. The temporary coma had ceased, and activity
had come with the necessity for it. Deeds of endur-
ance, which seem ordinary in philosophy, are rare in
conduct, and Bathsheba was astonishing all around her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
now, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) philosophy was her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) conduct, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
seldom thought practicable what she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) did not practise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was of the stuff of which great men's mothers
are made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was indispensable to high generation,
hated at tea parties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.
Troy recumbent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) wife's lap formed now the sole
spectacle in the middle of the spacious room.
<div class="bookquote">``Gabriel.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, automatically, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) entered,
turning up a face of which only the wellknown lines
remained to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) it was hers, all else in the picture
having faded quite. <div class="bookquote">``Ride to Casterbridge instantly
for a surgeon. It is, I believe, useless, but go. Mr.
Boldwood has shot my husband.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) statement of the fact in such quiet and simple
words came with more force than a tragic declamation,
and had somewhat the effect of setting the distorted
images in each mind present into proper focus. Oak,
almost before he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had comprehended anything beyond
the briefest abstract of the event, hurried out of the
room, saddled a horse and rode away. Not till he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had
ridden more than a mile did it occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
would have done better by sending some other man
on this errand, remaining himself in the house. What
had become of Boldwood? He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) should have been
looked after. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) mad -- had there been a quarrel?
Then how had Troy got there? Where had he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) come
from? How did this remarkable reappearance effect
itself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) was supposed by many to be at the
bottom of the sea? Oak had in some slight measure
been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a
rumour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) return just before entering Boldwood's
house; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had weighed that information, this
fatal event had been superimposed. However, it was too
late now to think of sending another messenger, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) rode on, in the excitement of these self-inquiries
not discerning, when about three miles from Caster-
bridge, a square-figured pedestrian passing along
under the dark hedge in the same direction as his (<font color='blue'><b>pedestrian</b></font>)
own.
The miles necessary to be traversed, and other
hindrances incidental to the lateness of the hour and
the darkness of the night, delayed the arrival of Mr,
Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours
passed between the time at which the shot was fired
and that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Aldritch</b></font>) entering the house. Oak was addition-
ally detained in Casterbridge through having to give
notice to the authorities of what had happened; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Aldritch</b></font>) then found that Boldwood had also entered the
town, and delivered himself up.
In the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into
the hall at Boldwood's, found it in darkness and quite
deserted. He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) went on to the back of the house,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) discovered in the kitchen an old man, of
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) made inquiries.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>)'s had him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) took away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) own house, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>informant</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) informant.
<div class="bookquote">``Who has?''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor.
``Mrs. Troy. ``A was quite dead, sir.''
This was astonishing information. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had no
right to do that.'' said the doctor. ``There will have
to be an inquest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) should have waited to know
what to do.''
``Yes, sir; it was hinted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had better
wait till the law was known. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) said law was
nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) wouldn't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) dear husband's
corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all the
crowners in England.''
Mr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the
hill to Bathsheba's. The first person he (<font color='blue'><b>Aldritch</b></font>) met was
poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have dwindled
smaller in these few latter hours. ``What has been
done?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Aldritch</b></font>) said.
``I don't know, sir.'' said Liddy, with suspended
breath. ``My mistress has done it all.''
``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?''
``Upstairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), sir. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was brought
home and taken upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wanted no
further help from the men. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) called me,
and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I
had better go and lie down because I looked so ill.
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) locked herself into the room alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
and would not let a nurse come in, or anybody at all.
But I thought I'd wait in the next room in case she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
should want me. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) moving about inside
for more than an hour, but she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) only came out once,
and that was for more candles, because hers had burnt
down into the socket. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said we were to let her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
know when you or Mr. Thirdly came, sir.''
Oak entered with the parson at this moment, and
they all went upstairs together, preceded by Liddy
Smallbury. Everything was silent as the grave when
they paused on the landing. Liddy knocked, and
Bathsheba's dress was heard rustling across the room:
the key turned in the lock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) opened the door.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) looks were calm and nearly rigid, like a slightly
animated bust of Melpomene.
``Oh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)
murmured from her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) lips merely, and threw back the
door. ``Ah, and Mr. Thirdly. Well, all is done, and
anybody in the world may see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) now.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) then
passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>), crossed the landing, and entered
another room.
Looking into the chamber of death she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) had vacated
they saw by the light of the candles which were on the
drawers a tall straight shape lying at the further end
of the bedroom, wrapped in white. Everything around
was quite orderly. The doctor went in, and after a
few minutes returned to the landing again, where
Oak and the parson still waited.
``It is all done, indeed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) says.'' remarked Mr.
Aldritch, in a subdued voice. ``The body has been
undressed and properly laid out in grave clothes.
Gracious Heaven -- this mere girl! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must have the
nerve of a stoic!''
``The heart of a wife merely.'' floated in a whisper
about the ears of the three, and turning they saw
Bathsheba in the midst of them. Then, as if at that
instant to prove that her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) fortitude had been more of
will than of spontaneity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) silently sank down between
them and was a shapeless heap of drapery on the floor.
The simple consciousness that superhuman strain was
no longer required had at once put a period to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
power to continue it.
They took her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) away into a further room, and the
medical attendance which had been useless in Troy's
case was invaluable in Bathsheba's, who fell into a
series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect for a
time. The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding
from the bulletins that nothing really dreadful was to
be apprehended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) score, left the house. Liddy
kept watch in Bathsheba's chamber, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) mistress, moaning in whispers through the dull
slow hours of that wretched night: <div class="bookquote">``O it is my fault
-- how can I live! O Heaven, how can I live!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LV



<p/>THE MARCH FOLLOWING -- <div class="bookquote">``BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD''


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>WE pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a
breezy day without sunshine, frost, or dew. On Yai*-
bury Hill, about midway between Weatherbury and
Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over
the crest, a numerous concourse of people had
gathered, the eyes of the greater number being fre-
quently stretched afar in a northerly direction. The
groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of
javelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst
were carriages, one of which contained the high
sheriff. With the idlers, many of whom had mounted
to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several
Weatherbury men and boys -- among others Poorgrass,
Coggan, and Cain Ball.
At the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in
the expected quarter, and shortly after a travelling-
carriage, bringing one of the two judges on the Western
Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the top. The
judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown
by the big-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being
formed of the vehicles and javelin-men, they all pro-
ceeded towards the town, excepting the Weatherbury
men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move
off returned home again to their work.
<div class="bookquote">``Joseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, as they walked. <div class="bookquote">``Did ye notice my lord
judge's face?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>said Poorgrass. <div class="bookquote">``I looked hard at en, as
if I would read his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) very soul; and there was mercy
in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) eyes -- or to speak with the exact truth required
of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was towards
me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope for the best.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, though
bad that must be. However, I shan't go to the trial,
and I'd advise the rest of ye that bain't wanted to bide
away. <div class="bookquote">``Twill disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) mind more than anything to
see us there staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) were a show.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The very thing I said this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>observed Joseph,
<div class="bookquote">``Justice is come to weigh him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) in the balances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joseph/Joseph Poorgrass/Poorgrass</b></font>)</div>I said
in my reflectious way, <div class="bookquote">``and if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)'s found wanting, so

A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a bystander</b></font>)</div>But I don't like dwelling upon it, for my few words
are my few words, and not much; though the speech
of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature
formed for such.''
``So `tis, Joseph. And now, neighbours, as I said,
every man bide at home.<div class="bookquote">''
The resolution was adhered to; and all waited
anxiously for the news next day. Their suspense
was diverted, however, by a discovery which was made
in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood's
conduct and condition than any details which had
preceded it.
That he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) had been from the time of Greenhill Fair
until the fatal Christmas Eve in excited and unusual
moods was known to those who had been intimate
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>); but nobody imagined that there had shown
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) unequivocal symptoms of the mental derange-
ment which Bathsheba and Oak, alone of all others
and at different times, had momentarily suspected.
In a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary
collection of articles. There were several sets of ladies''
 (<font color='red'><b>every man</b></font>)</div>dresses in the piece, of sundry expensive materials;
silks and satins, poplins and velvets, all of colours
which from Bathsheba's style of dress might have been
judged to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) favourites. There were two muffs,
sable and ermine. Above all there was a case of
jewellery, containing four heavy gold bracelets and
several lockets and rings, all of fine quality and manu-
facture. These things had been bought in Bath and
other towns from time to time, and brought home by
stealth. They were all carefully packed in paper, and
each package was labelled <div class="bookquote">'' Bathsheba Boldwood.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a
date being subjoined six years in advance in every
instance.
These somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed
with care and love were the subject of discourse in
Warren's malt-house when Oak entered from Caster-
bridge with tidings of the kiln glow shone upon
it, told the tale sufficiently well. Boldwood, as every
one supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) would do, had pleaded guilty, and
had been sentenced to death.
The conviction that Boldwood had not been morally
responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) later acts now became general. Facts
elicited previous to the trial had pointed strongly in the
same direction, but they had not been of sufficient weight
to lead to an order for an examination into the state
of Boldwood's mind. It was astonishing, now that a
presumption of insanity was raised, how many collateral
circumstances were remembered to which a condition
of mental disease seemed to afford the only explanation
-- among others, the unprecedented neglect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) corn
stacks in the previous summer.
A petition was addressed to the Home Secretary,
advancing the circumstances which appeared to justify
a request for a reconsideration of the sentence. It was
not <div class="bookquote">``numerously signed''  (<font color='red'><b>the inhabitants</b></font>)</div>by the inhabitants of Caster-
bridge, as is usual in such cases, for Boldwood had
never made many friends over the counter. The shops
thought it very natural that a man who, by importing
direct from the producer, had daringly set aside the
first great principle of provincial existence, namely
that God made country villages to supply customers
to county towns, should have confused ideas about
the Decalogue. The prompters were a few merciful
men who had perhaps too feelingly considered the
facts latterly unearthed, and the result was that evidence
was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime
in a moral point of view, out of the category of wilful
murder, and lead it to be regarded as a sheer outcome
of madness.
The upshot of the petition was waited for in Weather-
bury with solicitous interest. The execution had been
fixed for eight o'clock on a Saturday morning about a
fortnight after the sentence was passed, and up to
Friday afternoon no answer had been received. At
that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been to wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned
down a by-street to avoid the town. When past the last
house he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) heard a hammering, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) bowed
head he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) looked back for a moment. Over the chimneys
he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) could see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich
and glowing in the afternoon sun, and some moving
figures were there. They were carpenters lifting a post
into a vertical position within the parapet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) with-
drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) eyes quickly, and hastened on.
It was dark when he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) reached home, and half the
village was out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``No tidings.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel said, wearily. <div class="bookquote">``And I'm afraid
there's no hope. I've been with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than two
hours.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do ye think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) REALLY was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
did it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Smallbury.
<div class="bookquote">``I can't honestly say that I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak replied. <div class="bookquote">``How-
ever, that we can talk of another time. Has there been
any change in mistress this afternoon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) downstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No. And getting on so nicely as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was too.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s but very little better now again than she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was at
Christmas. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) keeps on asking if you be come, and
if there's news, till one's wearied out wi' answering her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
Shall I go and say you've come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak. <div class="bookquote">``There's a chance yet; but I
couldn't stay in town any longer -- after seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) too,
So Laban -- Laban is here, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``What I've arranged is, that you shall ride to town
the last thing to-night; leave here about nine, and wait
a while there, getting home about twelve. If nothing
has been received by eleven to-night, they say there's
no chance at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do so hope his (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) life will be spared.''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy.
<div class="bookquote">``If it is not, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'ll go out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mind too. Poor thing;
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) sufferings have been dreadful; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) deserves any-
body's pity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) altered much?''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas,
you wouldn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said Liddy. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes are so
miserable that she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s not the same woman. Only two
years ago she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a romping girl, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s this!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Laban</b></font>)</div>Laban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock
that night several of the villagers strolled along the
road to Casterbridge and awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Liddy</b></font>) arrival-among
them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's men.
Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be
saved, even though in his (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) conscience he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boldwood</b></font>)
ought to die; for there had been qualities in the farmer
which Oak loved. At last, when they all were weary
the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance --
First dead, as if on turf it trode,
Then, clattering on the village road
In other pace than forth he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) yode.
<div class="bookquote">``We shall soon know now, one way or other.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said
Coggan, and they all stepped down from the bank on
which they had been standing into the road, and the
rider pranced into the midst of them.
<div class="bookquote">``Is that you, Laban?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
``Yes -- `tis come. He (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s not to die. ``Tis confine-
ment during her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) Majesty's pleasure.''
``Hurrah!'' said Coggan, with a swelling heart. <div class="bookquote">``God's
above the devil yet!''




 (<font color='red'><b>ALL</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LVI



<p/>BEAUTY IN LONELINESS -- AFTER ALL


<p/>BATHSHEBA revived with the spring. The utter
prostration that had followed the low fever from which
she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) had suffered diminished perceptibly when all un-
certainty upon every subject had come to an end.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) remained alone now for the greater part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) time, and stayed in the house, or at furthest went
into the garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) shunned every one, even Liddy,
and could be brought to make no confidences, and to
ask for no sympathy.
As the summer drew on she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) passed more of her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) time
in the open air, and began to examine into farming
matters from sheer necessity, though she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) never rode
out or personally superintended as at former times.
One Friday evening in August she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) walked a little way
along the road and entered the village for the first time
since the sombre event of the preceding Christmas.
None of the old colour had as yet come to her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) cheek,
and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black
of her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) gown, till it appeared preternatural. When she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>)
reached a little shop at the other end of the place,
which stood nearly opposite to the churchyard, Bath-
sheba heard singing inside the church, and she (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) knew
that the singers were practising. She (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) crossed the road,
opened the gate, and entered the graveyard, the high
sills of the church windows effectually screening her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>)
from the eyes of those gathered within. Her (<font color='blue'><b>ALL</b></font>) stealthy
walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at
planting flowers upon Fanny Robin's grave, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)
came to the marble tombstone.
A motion of satisfaction enlivened her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>)
read the complete inscription. First came the words of
Troy himself: --
ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY
IN BELOVED MEMORY OF
FANNY ROBIN,
WHO DIED OCTOBER 9, 18 -- ,
AGED 20 YEARS.
Underneath this was now inscribed in new letters: --
IN THE SAME GRAVE LIE
THE REMAINS OF THE AFORESAID
FRANCIS TROY,
WHO DIED DECEMBER 24TH, 18 -- ,
Whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) stood and read and meditated the tones of
the organ began again in the church, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) went
with the same light step round to the porch and listened.
The door was closed, and the choir was learning a new
hymn. Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which
latterly she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) had assumed to be altogether dead within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>). The little attenuated voices of the children
brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) ear in destinct utterance the words they
sang without thought or comprehension --
Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on.
Bathsheba's feeling was always to some extent de-
pendent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) whim, as is the case with many other
women. Something big came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) throat and an
uprising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) eyes -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) would
allow the imminent tears to flow if they wished. They
did flow and plenteously, and one fell upon the stone
bench beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>). Once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) had begun to cry for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) hardly knew what, she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) could not leave off for crowd-
ing thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) knew too well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) would have given
anything in the world to be, as those children were, un-
concerned at the meaning of their words, because too
innocent to feel the necessity for any such expression.
All the impassioned scenes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) brief expenence
seemed to revive with added emotion at that moment,
and those scenes which had been without emotion
during enactment had emotion then. Yet grief came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former
times.
Owing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) hands
she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) did not notice a form which came quietly into the
porch, and on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>), first moved as if to retreat,
then paused and regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>). Bathsheba did not raise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) head for some time, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) looked round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) face was wet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) eyes drowned and dim. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>exclaimed she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>), disconcerted, <div class="bookquote">'' how long have you
been here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A few minutes, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, respectfully.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going in?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba; and there came
from within the church as from a prompter --
l loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
pride ruled my will: remember not past years.
<div class="bookquote">``I was.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. ``I am one of the bass singers,
you know. I have sung bass for several months.
``Indeed: I wasn't aware of that. I'll leave you, then.''
which I have loved long since, and lost awhile,
sang the children.
``Don't let me drive you away, mistress. I think I
won't go in to-night.''
``O no -- you don't drive me away.
Then they stood in a state of some embarrassment
Bathsheba trying to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) dreadfully drenched and
inflamed face without his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). At length Oak
said, I've not seen you-i mean spoken to you -- since
ever so long, have I?'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) feared to bring distress-
ing memories back, and interrupted himself with: ``Were
you going into church?''
``No.<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Robin</b></font>) said. I came to see the tombstone
privately -- to see if they had cut the inscription as I
wished Mr. Oak, you needn't mind speaking to me, if
you wish to, on the matter which is in both our minds
at this moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And have they done it as you wished?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes. Come and see it, if you have not already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So together they went and read the tomb. <div class="bookquote">``Eight
months ago!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>Gabriel murmured when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw the date.
<div class="bookquote">``It seems like yesterday to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And to me as if it were years ago-long years, and
I had been dead between. And now I am going home,
Mr. Oak.''
Oak walked after her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). ``I wanted to name a small
matter to you as soon as I could.'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said, with hesitation.
``Merrily about business, and I think I may just mention it
now, if you'll allow me.''
``O yes, certainly.<div class="bookquote">''
It is that I may soon have to give up the manage-
ment of your farm, Mrs. Troy. The fact is, I am think-
ing of leaving England -- not yet, you know -- next
spring. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leaving England!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said, in surprise and
genuine disappointment.<div class="bookquote">'' Why, Gabriel, what are you
going to do that for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, I've thought it best.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak stammered out.
<div class="bookquote">``California is the spot I've had in my mind to try.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But it is understood everywhere that you are going
to take poor Mr. Boldwood's farm on your own account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've had the refusal o' it `tis true; but nothing is
settled yet, and I have reasons for giving up. I shall
finish out my year there as manager for the trustees,
but no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And what shall I do without you? Oh, Gabriel, I
don't think you ought to go away. You've been with
me so long -- through bright times and dark times -- such
old friends that as we are -- that it seems unkind almost. I
had fancied that if you leased the other farm as master,
you might still give a helping look across at mine. And
now going away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would have willingly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yet now that I am more helpless than ever you go
away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the ill fortune o' it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, in a
distressed tone. <div class="bookquote">``And it is because of that very help-
lessness that I feel bound to go. Good afternoon,
ma'am''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) concluded, in evident anxiety to get
away, and at once went out of the churchyard by a
path she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could follow on no pretence whatever.
Bathsheba went home, her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind occupied with a
new trouble, which being rather harassing than deadly
was calculated to do good by diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) from the
chronic gloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was set thinking a great
deal about Oak and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) which to shun her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); and there
occurred to Bathsheba several incidents of latter in-
tercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>), which, trivial when singly viewed
amounted together to a perceptible disinclination for
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) society. It broke upon her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) at length as a great
pain that her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) last old disciple was about to forsake her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
and flee. He (<font color='blue'><b>disciple</b></font>) who had believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and argued on
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) side when all the rest of the world was against her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),
had at last like the others become weary and neglectful
of the old cause, and was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to fight her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) battles
alone.
Three weeks went on, and more evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>disciple</b></font>)
want of interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was forthcoming. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) noticed
that instead of entering the small parlour or office
where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or
leaving a memorandum as he (<font color='blue'><b>disciple</b></font>) had hitherto done during
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) seclusion, Oak never came at all when she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was likely
to be there, only entering at unseasonable hours when
her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) presence in that part of the house was least to be
expected. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) wanted directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) sent a
message, or note with neither heading nor signature, to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was obliged to reply in the same off-hand
style. Poor Bathsheba began to suffer now from the
most torturing sting of ali-a sensation that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was
despised.
The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these
melancholy conjectures, and Christmas-day came, com-
pleting a year of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) legal widowhood, and two years
and a quarter of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life alone. On examining her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the sub-
ject of which the season might have been supposed
suggestive -- the event in the hall at Boldwood's -- was
not agitating her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) at all; but instead, an agonizing con-
viction that everybody abjured her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) -- for what she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could
not tell -- and that Oak was the ringleader of the
recusants. Coming out of church that day she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) looked
round in hope that Oak, whose bass voice she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had
heard rolling out from the gallery overhead in a most
unconcerned manner, might chance to linger in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) path
in the old way. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was, as usual, coming down
the path behind her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). But on seeing Bathsheba turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
looked aside, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) got beyond the gate,
and there was the barest excuse for a divergence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
made one, and vanished.
The next morning brought the culminating stroke;
she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had been expecting it long. It was a formal notice
by letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) should not renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) engage-
ment with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) for the following Lady-day.
Bathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most
bitterly. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was aggrieved and wounded that the
possession of hopeless love from Gabriel, which she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had
AFTER ALL
grown to regard as her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) inalienable right for life, should
have been withdrawn just at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own pleasure in this
way. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was bewildered too by the prospect of having
to rely on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own resources again: it seemed to herself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never could again acquire energy sufficient to
go to market, barter, and sell. Since Troy's death Oak
had attended all sales and fairs for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), transacting her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
business at the same time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) own. What should
she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) do now? Her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life was becoming a desolation.
So desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an
absolute hunger for pity and sympathy, and miserable in
that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) appeared to have outlived the only true friend-
ship she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had ever owned, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) bonnet and
cloak and went down to Oak's house just after sunset,
guided on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) way by the pale primrose rays of a
crescent moon a few days old.
A lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody
was visible in the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) tapped nervously, and
then thought it doubtful if it were right for a single
woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone, although
he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manager, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be supposed to call
on business without any real impropriety. Gabriel
opened the door, and the moon shone upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) fore-
haad.
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, faintly.
<div class="bookquote">``Yes; I am Mr. Oak.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. <div class="bookquote">``Who have I
the honour -- O how stupid of me, not to know you,
mistress!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I
Gabriel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, in pathetic tones.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, no. I suppose -- But come in, ma'am. Oh --
and I'll get a light.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oak replied, with some awkwardness.
<div class="bookquote">``No; not on my account.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I'm
afraid I haven't proper accommodation. Will you sit
down, please? Here's a chair, and there's one, too.
I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and are
rather hard, but I was thinking of getting some new
ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Oak placed two or three for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``They are quite easy enough for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So down she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat, and down sat he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), the fire dancing
in their faces, and upon the old furniture
all a-sheenen
Wi' long years o' handlen,
that formed Oak's array of household possessions, which
sent back a dancing reflection in reply. It was very
odd to these two persons, who knew each other passing
well, that the mere circumstance of their meeting in a
new place and in a new way should make them so
awkward and constrained. In the fields, or at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house,
there had never been any embarrassment; but now that
Oak had become the entertainer their lives seemed to be
moved back again to the days when they were strangers.
<div class="bookquote">``You'll think it strange that I have come, but -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no; not at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But I thought -- Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the
belief that I have offended you, and that you are going
away on that account. It grieved me very much and
I couldn't help coming.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Offended me! As if you could do that, Bathsheba!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Haven't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked, gladly. <div class="bookquote">``But, what are you
going away for else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn't
aware that you would wish me not to when I told `ee or I
shouldn't ha' thought of doing it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) said, simply. <div class="bookquote">``I
have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and shall
have it in my own hands at Lady-day. You know I've
had a share in it for some time. Still, that wouldn't
prevent my attending to your business as before, hadn't
it been that things have been said about us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Things said
about you and me! What are they?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be wiser if you were to, I think. You have
played the part of mentor to me many times, and I don't
see why you should fear to do it now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is nothing that you have done, this time. The
top and tail o't is this -- that I am sniffing about here,
and waiting for poor Boldwood's farm, with a thought
of getting you some day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Getting me! What does that mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Marrying o' `ee, in plain British. You asked me to
tell, so you mustn't blame me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a
cannon had been discharged by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear, which was what
Oak had expected. <div class="bookquote">``Marrying me! I didn't know it
was that you meant.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Such a thing
as that is too absurd -- too soon -- to think of, by far!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Yes; of course, it is too absurd. I don't desire any
such thing; I should think that was plain enough by
this time. Surely, surely you be the last person in the
world I think of marrying. It is too absurd, as you say
``Too -- s-s-soon<div class="bookquote">'' were the words I used.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``I must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you
said, ``too absurd,<div class="bookquote">'' and so do I.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon too! she (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) returned, with tears
in her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) eyes. '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Too soon''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was what I said. But it
doesn't matter a bit -- not at ali-but I only meant,
<div class="bookquote">``too soon''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Indeed, I didn't, Mr. Oak, and you must
believe me!''
Gabriel looked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long in the face, but the firelight
being faint there was not much to be seen. ``Bathsheba,''
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, tenderly and in surprise, and coming closer:
``if I only knew one thing -- whether you would allow me
to love you and win you, and marry you after ali-if I
only knew that!''
``But you never will know.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured.
``Why?''
``Because you never ask.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh -- Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyous-
ness. <div class="bookquote">``My own dear -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ought not to have sent me that harsh letter
this morning.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interrupted. <div class="bookquote">``It shows you didn't
care a bit about me, and were ready to desert me like
all the rest of them! It was very cruel of you, consider-
ing I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and
you were the first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Now, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, laughing. ``You know it was purely that I, as
an unmarried man, carrying on a business for you as a
very taking young woman, had a proper hard part to
play -- more particular that people knew I had a sort
of feeling for`ee; and I fancied, from the way we were
mentioned together, that it might injure your good name.
Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been caused
by it.''
``And was that all?''
``All.''
``Oh, how glad I am I came!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, thank-
fully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seat. ``I have thought so
much more of you since I fancied you did not want
even to see me again. But I must be going now, or I
shall be missed. Why Gabriel.'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, with a slight
laugh, as they went to the door, ``it seems exactly as if
I had come courting you -- how dreadful!''
``And quite right too.'' said Oak. <div class="bookquote">``I've danced at
your skittish heels, my beautiful Bathsheba, for many a
long mile, and many a long day; and it is hard to be-
grudge me this one visit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up the hill, explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forthcoming tenure of the other farm.
They spoke very little of their mutual feeling; pretty
phrases and warm expressions being probably un-
necessary between such tried friends. Theirs was that
substantial affection which arises -LRB-if any arises at all-RRB-
when the two who are thrown together begin first by
knowing the rougher sides of each other's character,
and not the best till further on, the romance growing
up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality.
This good-fellowship -- CAMARADERIE -- usually occurring
through similarity of pursuits, is unfortunately seldom
superadded to love between the sexes, because men and
women associate, not in their labours, but in their
pleasures merely. Where, however, happy circumstance
permits its development, the compounded feeling proves
itself to be the only love which is strong as death -- that
love which many waters cannot quench, nor the floods
drown, beside which the passion usually called by the
name is evanescent as steam.




<p/>CHAPTER LVII



<p/>A FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING -- CONCLUSION


<p/><div class="bookquote">``THE most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is
possible to have.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one
evening, some time after the event of the preceding
chapter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) meditated a full hour by the clock upon
how to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) wishes to the letter.
<div class="bookquote">``A licence -- O yes, it must be a licence.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) said
to himself at last. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, then; first, a license.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the surrogate</b></font>)</div>On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with
mysterious steps from the surrogate's door, in Caster-
bridge. On the way home he (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>) heard a heavy tread in
front of him (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>), and, overtaking the man, found him (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>) to be
Coggan. They walked together into the village until
they came to a little lane behind the church, leading
down to the cottage of Laban Tall, who had lately been
installed as clerk of the parish, and was yet in mortal
terror at church on Sundays when he (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>) lone
voice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither
no man ventured to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>surrogate</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Well, good-night, Coggan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, <div class="bookquote">``I'm going
down this way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, surprised; <div class="bookquote">``what's going on to-
night then, make so bold Mr. Oak?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan,
under the circumstances, for Coggan had been true as
steel all through the time of Gabriel's unhappiness about
Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, <div class="bookquote">'' You can keep a secret,
Coggan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You've proved me, and you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have, and I do know. Well, then, mistress
and I mean to get married to-morrow morning.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Heaven's high tower! And yet I've thought of
such a thing from time to time; true, I have. But
keeping it so close! Well, there, `tis no consarn of
amine, and I wish `ee joy o' her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Coggan. But I assure `ee that this
great hush is not what I wished for at all, or what
either of us would have wished if it hadn't been for
certain things that would make a gay wedding seem
hardly the thing. Bathsheba has a great wish that all
the parish shall not be in church, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) -- she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s
shylike and nervous about it, in fact -- so I be doing
this to humour her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say.
And you be now going down to the clerk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes; you may as well come with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be
throwed away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan, as they walked along.
<div class="bookquote">``Labe Tall's old woman will horn it all over parish in
half-an-hour. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will, upon my life; I never thought of
that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Oak, pausing. <div class="bookquote">``Yet I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to-
night, I suppose, for he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s working so far off, and leaves
early.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell `ee how we could tackle her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``I'll knock and ask to speak to Laban outside the door,
you standing in the background. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ll come out,
and you can tell yer tale. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never guess what I
want en for; and I'll make up a few words about the
farm-work, as a blind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan
advanced boldly, and rapped at Mrs. Tall's door. Mrs.
Tall herself opened it.
<div class="bookquote">``I wanted to have a word with Laban.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'s not at home, and won't be this side of eleven
o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)'ve been forced to go over to Yalbury since
shutting out work. I shall do quite as well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hardly think you will. Stop a moment;''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>and
Coggan stepped round the corner of the porch to consult
Oak.
<div class="bookquote">``Who's t`other man, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tall.
<div class="bookquote">``Only a friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
<div class="bookquote">``Say he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)'s wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch
to-morrow morning at ten.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel/Oak/Gabriel Oak</b></font>)</div>said Oak, in a whisper.
<div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must come without fail, and wear his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) best
clothes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!''  (<font color='red'><b>Coggan/Jan Coggan/Jan</b></font>)</div>said Coggan.
``It can't be helped said Oak. ``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''
So Coggan delivered the message. ``Mind, het or
wet, blow or snow, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must come, added Jan. <div class="bookquote">''`Tis
very particular, indeed. The fact is, `tis to witness her (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
sign some law-work about taking shares wi' another
farmer for a long span o' years. There, that's what `tis,
and now I've told `ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't
ha' done if I hadn't loved `ee so hopeless well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Coggan retired before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) could ask any further;
and next they called at the vicar's in a manner which
excited no curiosity at all. Then Gabriel went home,
and prepared for the morrow.
<div class="bookquote">``Liddy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div>said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night,
<div class="bookquote">``I want you to call me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In
case I shouldn't wake.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bathsheba/Bathsheba Everdene/BATHSHEBA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I have something important to do, which
I'll tell you of when the time comes, and it's best to
make sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>CONCLUSION Bathsheba</b></font>)</div>CONCLUSION
Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) by any contrivance get to sleep again. About
six, being quite positive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) watch had stopped
during the night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) could wait no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) went
and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``But I thought it was I who had to call you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Liddy/Smallbury/Liddy Smallbury</b></font>)</div>said
the bewildered Liddy. <div class="bookquote">``And it isn't six yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy?
I know it must be ever so much past seven. Come to
my room as soon as you can; I want you to give my
hair a good brushing.''
When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mistress
was already waiting. Liddy could not understand
this extraordinary promptness. ``Whatever IS going on,
ma'am?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said.
``Well, I'll tell you.'' said Bathsheba, with a mischiev-
ous smile in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bright eyes. ``Farmer Oak is coming
here to dine with me to-day!''
``Farmer Oak -- and nobody else? -- you two alone?''
``Yes.''
``But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?'' asked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) companion, dubiously. ``A woman's good name is
such a perishable article that -- -- <div class="bookquote">''
Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and
whispered in Liddy's ear, although there was nobody
present. Then Liddy stared and exclaimed, ''  (<font color='red'><b>A woman</b></font>)</div>Souls
alive, what news! It makes my heart go quite
bumpity-bump''
``It makes mine rather furious, too.'' said Bathsheba.
``However, there's no getting out of it now!''
It was a damp disagreeable morning. Nevertheless,
at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>)
house, and
Went up the hill side
With that sort of stride
A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,
and knocked Bathsheba's door. Ten minutes later
a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen
moving from the same door, and through the mist along
the road to the church. The distance was not more
than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons
deemed it unnecessary to drive. An observer must have
been very close indeed to discover that the forms under
the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba, arm-in-
arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a greatcoat
extending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bathsheba</b></font>) knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) clogs. Yet, though so plainly dressed
there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>): --
As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.
Repose had again incarnadined her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) cheeks; and having,
at Gabriel's request, arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) hair this morning as
she (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill, she (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) seemed
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating
dream, which, considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>) was now only three
or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful. In
the church were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a
remarkably short space of time the deed was done.
The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's
parlour in the evening of the same day, for it had been
arranged that Farmer Oak should go there to live, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) had as yet neither money, house, nor furniture worthy
of the name, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) was on a sure way towards them,
whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all
three.
Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea,
their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon,
followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of
trumpets, in the front of the house.
``There!'' said Oak, laughing, ``I knew those fellows
were up to something, by the look on their face; ''
Oak took up the light and went into the porch,
followed by Bathsheba with a shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) head. The
rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the
gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly-married
couple in the porch, set up a loud ``Hurrah!'' and at
the same moment bang again went the cannon in the
background, followed by a hideous clang of music from
a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy, tenor-
viol, and double-bass -- the only remaining relics of the
true and original Weatherbury band -- venerable worm-
eaten instruments, which had celebrated in their own
persons the victories of Marlhorough, under the fingers
of the forefathers of those who played them now. The
performers came forward, and marched up to the
front.
``Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the
bottom of all this.'' said Oak. ``Come in, souls, and
have something to eat and drink wi' me and my wife.''
``Not to-night.'' said Mr. Clark, with evident self-
denial. ``Thank ye all the same; but we'll call at a
more seemly time. However, we couldn't think of
letting the day pass without a note of admiration of
some sort. If ye could send a drop of som`at down to
Warren's, why so it is. Here's long life and happiness
to neighbour Oak and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oak</b></font>) comely bride!''
``Thank ye; thank ye all.'' said Gabriel. ``A bit and
a drop shall be sent to Warren's for ye at once. I had
a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some
sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to my
wife but now.''
``Faith.'' said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>)
companions, ``the man hev learnt to say <div class="bookquote">``my wife''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>in a wonderful naterel way, considering how very youth-
ful he (<font color='blue'><b>Coggan</b></font>) is in wedlock as yet -- hey, neighbours all?''
``I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty
years'' standing pipe ``my wife<div class="bookquote">'' in a more used note
than 'a did.''  (<font color='red'><b>pipe wife</b></font>)</div>said Jacob Smallbury. ``It might have been
a little more true to nater if't had been spoke a little
chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just now.
``That improvement will come wi' time.'' said Jan,
twirling his (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>) eye.
Then Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallbury</b></font>)
never laughed readily now-RRB-, and their friends turned to
go.
``Yes; I suppose that's the size o`t.'' said Joseph
Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away;
``and I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) joy o' her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); though I were once or
twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my
scripture manner, which is my second nature. <div class="bookquote">``Ephraim
is joined to idols: let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ephraim</b></font>) alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But since `tis as `tis
why, it might have been worse, and I feel my thanks
accordingly.''
