<p/>I


<p/>DURING a portion of the first half of the present century, and more
particularly during the latter part of it, there flourished and practised
in the city of New York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an exceptional
share of the consideration which, in the United States, has always been
bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical profession. This
profession in America has constantly been held in honour, and more
successfully than elsewhere has put forward a claim to the epithet of
<div class="bookquote">``liberal.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In a country in which, to play a social part, you must either
earn your income or make believe that you earn it, the healing art has
appeared in a high degree to combine two recognised sources of credit.
It belongs to the realm of the practical, which in the United States is a
great recommendation; and it is touched by the light of science--a merit
appreciated in a community in which the love of knowledge has not always
been accompanied by leisure and opportunity. It was an element in Dr.
Sloper's reputation that his (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) learning and his (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) skill were very evenly
balanced; he (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) was what you might call a scholarly doctor, and yet there
was nothing abstract in his (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) remedies--he (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) always ordered you to take
something. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) was felt to be extremely thorough, he (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) was not
uncomfortably theoretic, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>United</b></font>) sometimes explained matters rather
more minutely than might seem of use to the patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) never went so far
-LRB-like some practitioners one has heard of-RRB- as to trust to the explanation
alone, but always left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) an inscrutable prescription. There
were some doctors that left the prescription without offering any
explanation at all; and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) did not belong to that class either, which
was, after all, the most vulgar. It will be seen that I am describing a
clever man; and this is really the reason why Dr. Sloper had become a
local celebrity. At the time at which we are chiefly concerned with him (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) was some fifty years of age, and his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) popularity was at its height. He (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>)
was very witty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) passed in the best society of New York for a man
of the world--which, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, in a very sufficient degree. I
hasten to add, to anticipate possible misconception, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not the
least of a charlatan. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a thoroughly honest man--honest in a degree
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete
measure; and, putting aside the great good-nature of the circle in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) practised, which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed the
<div class="bookquote">``brightest''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>doctor in the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daily justified his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) claim to the
talents attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the popular voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an observer, even
a philosopher, and to be bright was so natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and -LRB-as the
popular voice said-RRB- came so easily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never aimed at mere effect,
and had none of the little tricks and pretensions of second-rate
reputations. It must be confessed that fortune had favoured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found the path to prosperity very soft to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tread. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
married at the age of twenty-seven, for love, a very charming girl, Miss
Catherine Harrington, of New York, who, in addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) charms, had
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a solid dowry. Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful,
accomplished, elegant, and in 1820 she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) had been one of the pretty girls
of the small but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and
overlooked the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was indicated by
the grassy waysides of Canal Street. Even at the age of twenty-seven
Austin Sloper had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) mark sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) having been chosen among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high
fashion, who had ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming
eyes in the island of Manhattan. These eyes, and some of their
accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme
satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a very
happy husband. The fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) having married a rich woman made no
difference in the line he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had traced for himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cultivated his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
profession with as definite a purpose as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) still had no other
resources than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fraction of the modest patrimony which on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father's
death he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had shared with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brothers and sisters. This purpose had not
been preponderantly to make money--it had been rather to learn something
and to do something. To learn something interesting, and to do something
useful--this was, roughly speaking, the programme he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had sketched, and of
which the accident of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife having an income appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in no
degree to modify the validity. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) practice, and of
exercising a skill of which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was agreeably conscious, and it was so
patent a truth that if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were not a doctor there was nothing else he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could be, that a doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) persisted in being, in the best possible
conditions. Of course his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) easy domestic situation saved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a good deal
of drudgery, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's affiliation to the <div class="bookquote">``best people''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
a good many of those patients whose symptoms are, if not more interesting
in themselves than those of the lower orders, at least more consistently
displayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desired experience, and in the course of twenty years he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
got a great deal. It must be added that it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in some forms
which, whatever might have been their intrinsic value, made it the
reverse of welcome. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) first child, a little boy of extraordinary
promise, as the Doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms, firmly
believed, died at three years of age, in spite of everything that the
mother's tenderness and the father's science could invent to save him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
Two years later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second infant--an infant of a
sex which rendered the poor child, to the Doctor's sense, an inadequate
substitute for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) lamented first-born, of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had promised himself
to make an admirable man. The little girl was a disappointment; but this
was not the worst. A week after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) birth the young mother, who, as the
phrase is, had been doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming symptoms, and
before another week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a widower.

<p/>For a man whose trade was to keep people alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had certainly done
poorly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own family; and a bright doctor who within three years
loses his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little boy should perhaps be prepared to see
either his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skill or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection impugned. Our friend, however, escaped
criticism: that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escaped all criticism but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, which was much
the most competent and most formidable. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked under the weight of
this very private censure for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days, and bore for ever the
scars of a castigation to which the strongest hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew had treated
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the night that followed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's death. The world, which, as I
have said, appreciated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too much to be ironical; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
misfortune made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more interesting, and even helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be the
fashion. It was observed that even medical families cannot escape the
more insidious forms of disease, and that, after all, Dr. Sloper had lost
other patients beside the two I have mentioned; which constituted an
honourable precedent. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little girl remained to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had desired, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proposed to himself to make the best of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had on hand a stock of unexpended authority, by which the child,
in its early years, profited largely. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been named, as a matter of
course, after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor mother, and even in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) most diminutive babyhood
the Doctor never called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anything but Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grew up a very
robust and healthy child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), often said
to himself that, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at least need have no fear of losing
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). I say <div class="bookquote">``such as she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>because, to tell the truth--But this is a
truth of which I will defer the telling.




<p/>II


<p/>WHEN the child was about ten years old, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) invited his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sister, Mrs.
Penniman, to come and stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The Miss Slopers had been but two
in number, and both of them had married early in life. The younger, Mrs.
Almond by name, was the wife of a prosperous merchant, and the mother of
a blooming family. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bloomed herself, indeed, and was a comely,
comfortable, reasonable woman, and a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clever brother,
who, in the matter of women, even when they were nearly related to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
was a man of distinct preferences. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) preferred Mrs. Almond to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
sister Lavinia, who had married a poor clergyman, of a sickly
constitution and a flowery style of eloquence, and then, at the age of
thirty-three, had been left a widow, without children, without
fortune--with nothing but the memory of Mr. Penniman's flowers of speech,
a certain vague aroma of which hovered about her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own conversation.
Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had offered her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) a home under his (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own roof, which Lavinia
accepted with the alacrity of a woman who had spent the ten years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
married life in the town of Poughkeepsie. The Doctor had not proposed to
Mrs. Penniman to come and live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) indefinitely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had suggested
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) should make an asylum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) house while she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) looked about for
unfurnished lodgings. It is uncertain whether Mrs. Penniman ever
instituted a search for unfurnished lodgings, but it is beyond dispute
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) never found them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) settled herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother and
never went away, and when Catherine was twenty years old her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) Aunt Lavinia
was still one of the most striking features of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) immediate _entourage_.
Mrs. Penniman's own account of the matter was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had remained to
take charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's education. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had given this account, at
least, to every one but the Doctor, who never asked for explanations
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could entertain himself any day with inventing. Mrs. Penniman,
moreover, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial
assurance, shrank, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother as a fountain of instruction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had not a high sense of
humour, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had enough to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) from making this mistake; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother, on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side, had enough to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) situation, for
laying him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) under contribution during a considerable part of a lifetime.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) therefore assented tacitly to the proposition which Mrs. Penniman had
tacitly laid down, that it was of importance that the poor motherless
girl should have a brilliant woman near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) assent could only be
tacit, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never been dazzled by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister's intellectual lustre.
Save when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fell in love with Catherine Harrington, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never been
dazzled, indeed, by any feminine characteristics whatever; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
was to a certain extent what is called a ladies' doctor, his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) private
opinion of the more complicated sex was not exalted. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) regarded its
complications as more curious than edifying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had an idea of the
beauty of _reason_, which was, on the whole, meagrely gratified by what
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) observed in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) female patients. His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife had been a reasonable
woman, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a bright exception; among several things that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was
sure of, this was perhaps the principal. Such a conviction, of course,
did little either to mitigate or to abbreviate his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) widowhood; and it set
a limit to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) recognition, at the best, of Catherine's possibilities and
of Mrs. Penniman's ministrations. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), nevertheless, at the end of six
months, accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sister's permanent presence as an accomplished fact,
and as Catherine grew older perceived that there were in effect good
reasons why she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have a companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own imperfect sex. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was
extremely polite to Lavinia, scrupulously, formally polite; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) in anger but once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) temper in
a theological discussion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) late husband. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) never
discussed theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) contented himself
with making known, very distinctly, in the form of a lucid ultimatum, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
wishes with regard to Catherine.

<p/>Once, when the girl was about twelve years old, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try and make a clever woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>), Lavinia; I should like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) to be a
clever woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Austin,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) then inquired, <div class="bookquote">``do you think it is better to be clever than to be
good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``You are good for nothing unless you
are clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>From this assertion Mrs. Penniman saw no reason to dissent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) possibly
reflected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own great use in the world was owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aptitude
for many things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I wish Catherine to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor said next day; <div class="bookquote">``but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) won't be any the less virtuous for not being a fool. I am not afraid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being wicked; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will never have the salt of malice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is as good as good bread, as the French say; but six
years hence I don't want to have to compare her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to good bread and
butter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will turn insipid? My dear brother, it is I who
supply the butter; so you needn't fear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, who had
taken in hand the child's accomplishments, overlooking her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) at the piano,
where Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to the
dancing-class, where it must be confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made but a modest
figure.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman was a tall, thin, fair, rather faded woman, with a
perfectly amiable disposition, a high standard of gentility, a taste for
light literature, and a certain foolish indirectness and obliquity of
character. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was romantic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was sentimental, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had a passion for
little secrets and mysteries--a very innocent passion, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) secrets had
hitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not
absolutely veracious; but this defect was of no great consequence, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had never had anything to conceal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would have liked to have a
lover, and to correspond with him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) under an assumed name in letters left
at a shop; I am bound to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) imagination never carried the
intimacy farther than this. Mrs. Penniman had never had a lover, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
brother, who was very shrewd, understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) turn of mind. <div class="bookquote">``When
Catherine is about seventeen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Lavinia will try and
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) that some young man with a moustache is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>).
It will be quite untrue; no young man, with a moustache or without, will
ever be in love with Catherine. But Lavinia will take it up, and talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) about it; perhaps, even, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) taste for clandestine operations
doesn't prevail with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) will talk to me about it. Catherine won't
see it, and won't believe it, fortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) peace of mind; poor
Catherine isn't romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was a healthy well-grown child, without a trace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) mother's
beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not ugly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had simply a plain, dull, gentle
countenance. The most that had ever been said for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had a
<div class="bookquote">``nice''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>face, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was an heiress, no one had ever thought of
regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) as a belle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father's opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) moral purity was
abundantly justified; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was excellently, imperturbably good;
affectionate, docile, obedient, and much addicted to speaking the truth.
In her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) younger years she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was a good deal of a romp, and, though it is an
awkward confession to make about one's heroine, I must add that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was
something of a glutton. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) never, that I know of, stole raisins out of
the pantry; but she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) devoted her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) pocket-money to the purchase of
cream-cakes. As regards this, however, a critical attitude would be
inconsistent with a candid reference to the early annals of any
biographer. Catherine was decidedly not clever; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not quick with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) book, nor, indeed, with anything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not abnormally
deficient, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mustered learning enough to acquit herself respectably
in conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) contemporaries, among whom it must be avowed,
however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) occupied a secondary place. It is well known that in
New York it is possible for a young girl to occupy a primary one.
Catherine, who was extremely modest, had no desire to shine, and on most
social occasions, as they are called, you would have found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lurking in
the background. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was extremely fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, and very much
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the cleverest and handsomest and most
celebrated of men. The poor girl found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) account so completely in the
exercise of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) affections that the little tremor of fear that mixed
itself with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) filial passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than
blunted its edge. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) deepest desire was to please him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
conception of happiness was to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had succeeded in pleasing
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never succeeded beyond a certain point. Though, on the
whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was perfectly aware of this, and to
go beyond the point in question seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really something to live
for. What she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not know, of course, was that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
though on three or four occasions the Doctor had been almost frank about
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grew up peacefully and prosperously, but at the age of eighteen
Mrs. Penniman had not made a clever woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>). Dr. Sloper would have
liked to be proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter; but there was nothing to be proud of
in poor Catherine. There was nothing, of course, to be ashamed of; but
this was not enough for the Doctor, who was a proud man and would have
enjoyed being able to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter as an unusual girl. There
would have been a fitness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being pretty and graceful, intelligent
and distinguished; for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother had been the most charming woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
little day, and as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own value.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had moments of irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) even went so far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in the
thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife had not lived to find her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) out. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was naturally
slow in making this discovery himself, and it was not till Catherine had
become a young lady grown that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) regarded the matter as settled. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the benefit of a great many doubts; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in no haste to
conclude. Mrs. Penniman frequently assured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter had a
delightful nature; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew how to interpret this assurance. It
meant, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt was a goose--a limitation of mind that could not fail to be
agreeable to Mrs. Penniman. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother, however,
exaggerated the young girl's limitations; for Catherine, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, and conscious of the gratitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) without a particle of that gentle dread which gave its stamp
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind there was nothing of the
infinite about Mrs. Penniman; Catherine saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all at once, as it were,
and was not dazzled by the apparition; whereas her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's great
faculties seemed, as they stretched away, to lose themselves in a sort of
luminous vagueness, which indicated, not that they stopped, but that
Catherine's own mind ceased to follow them.

<p/>It must not be supposed that Dr. Sloper visited his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disappointment upon
the poor girl, or ever let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suspect that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had played him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a trick.
On the contrary, for fear of being unjust to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty with
exemplary zeal, and recognised that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a faithful and affectionate
child. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a philosopher; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) smoked a good many cigars over
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disappointment, and in the fulness of time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got used to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
satisfied himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had expected nothing, though, indeed, with a
certain oddity of reasoning. <div class="bookquote">``I expect nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``so
that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gives me a surprise, it will be all clear again. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
doesn't, it will be no loss.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was about the time Catherine had
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eighteenth year, so that it will be seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had not
been precipitate. At this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed not only incapable of giving
surprises; it was almost a question whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could have received
one--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was so quiet and irresponsive. People who expressed themselves
roughly called her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stolid. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was irresponsive because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was shy,
uncomfortably, painfully shy. This was not always understood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sometimes produced an impression of insensibility. In reality she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
the softest creature in the world.




<p/>III


<p/>AS a child she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had promised to be tall, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sixteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ceased to grow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stature, like most other points in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
composition, was not unusual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was strong, however, and properly
made, and, fortunately, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) health was excellent. It has been noted that
the Doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and suffering person.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) appearance of health constituted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) principal claim to beauty, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clear, fresh complexion, in which white and red were very equally
distributed, was, indeed, an excellent thing to see. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye was small
and quiet, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features were rather thick, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tresses brown and smooth.
A dull, plain girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was called by rigorous critics--a quiet, ladylike
girl by those of the more imaginative sort; but by neither class was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
very elaborately discussed. When it had been duly impressed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a young lady--it was a good while before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could believe
it--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly developed a lively taste for dress: a lively taste is
quite the expression to use. I feel as if I ought to write it very
small, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) judgement in this matter was by no means infallible; it was
liable to confusions and embarrassments. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great indulgence of it was
really the desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest itself; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
sought to be eloquent in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) garments, and to make up for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) diffidence
of speech by a fine frankness of costume. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expressed herself
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clothes it is certain that people were not to blame for not
thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a witty person. It must be added that though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had the
expectation of a fortune--Dr. Sloper for a long time had been making
twenty thousand dollars a year by his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) profession, and laying aside the
half of it--the amount of money at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disposal was not greater than the
allowance made to many poorer girls. In those days in New York there
were still a few altar-fires flickering in the temple of Republican
simplicity, and Dr. Sloper would have been glad to see his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter
present herself, with a classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith.
It made him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
should be both ugly and overdressed. For himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fond of the
good things of life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a considerable use of them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a
dread of vulgarity, and even a theory that it was increasing in the
society that surrounded him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Moreover, the standard of luxury in the
United States thirty years ago was carried by no means so high as at
present, and Catherine's clever father took the old-fashioned view of the
education of young persons. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no particular theory on the subject;
it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of self-defence to have a
collection of theories. It simply appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) proper and reasonable
that a well-bred young woman should not carry half her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fortune on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
back. Catherine's back was a broad one, and would have carried a good
deal; but to the weight of the paternal displeasure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never ventured to
expose it, and our heroine was twenty years old before she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) treated
herself, for evening wear, to a red satin gown trimmed with gold fringe;
though this was an article which, for many years, she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had coveted in
secret. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) look, when she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) sported it, like a woman of thirty;
but oddly enough, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) taste for fine clothes, she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had not a
grain of coquetry, and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) anxiety when she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) put them on was as to whether
they, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>), would look well. It is a point on which history has
not been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable; it was in the royal
raiment just mentioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) presented herself at a little
entertainment given by her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) aunt, Mrs. Almond. The girl was at this time
in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) twenty-first year, and Mrs. Almond's party was the beginning of
something very important.

<p/>Some three or four years before this Dr. Sloper had moved his (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) household
gods up town, as they say in New York. He (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had been living ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
marriage in an edifice of red brick, with granite copings and an enormous
fanlight over the door, standing in a street within five minutes' walk of
the City Hall, which saw its best days -LRB-from the social point of view-RRB-
about 1820. After this, the tide of fashion began to set steadily
northward, as, indeed, in New York, thanks to the narrow channel in which
it flows, it is obliged to do, and the great hum of traffic rolled
farther to the right and left of Broadway. By the time the Doctor
changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) residence the murmur of trade had become a mighty uproar,
which was music in the ears of all good citizens interested in the
commercial development, as they delighted to call it, of their fortunate
isle. Dr. Sloper's interest in this phenomenon was only indirect--though,
seeing that, as the years went on, half his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) patients came to be
overworked men of business, it might have been more immediate--and when
most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) neighbours' dwellings -LRB-also ornamented with granite copings
and large fanlights-RRB- had been converted into offices, warehouses, and
shipping agencies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of commerce, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
determined to look out for a quieter home. The ideal of quiet and of
genteel retirement, in 1835, was found in Washington Square, where the
Doctor built himself a handsome, modern, wide-fronted house, with a big
balcony before the drawing-room windows, and a flight of marble steps
ascending to a portal which was also faced with white marble. This
structure, and many of its neighbours, which it exactly resembled, were
supposed, forty years ago, to embody the last results of architectural
science, and they remain to this day very solid and honourable dwellings.
In front of them was the Square, containing a considerable quantity of
inexpensive vegetation, enclosed by a wooden paling, which increased its
rural and accessible appearance; and round the corner was the more august
precinct of the Fifth Avenue, taking its origin at this point with a
spacious and confident air which already marked it for high destinies. I
know not whether it is owing to the tenderness of early associations, but
this portion of New York appears to many persons the most delectable. It
has a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in
other quarters of the long, shrill city; it has a riper, richer, more
honourable look than any of the upper ramifications of the great
longitudinal thoroughfare--the look of having had something of a social
history. It was here, as you might have been informed on good authority,
that you had come into a world which appeared to offer a variety of
sources of interest; it was here that your grandmother lived, in
venerable solitude, and dispensed a hospitality which commended itself
alike to the infant imagination and the infant palate; it was here that
you took your first walks abroad, following the nursery-maid with unequal
step and sniffing up the strange odour of the ailantus-trees which at
that time formed the principal umbrage of the Square, and diffused an
aroma that you were not yet critical enough to dislike as it deserved; it
was here, finally, that your first school, kept by a broad-bosomed,
broad-based old lady with a ferule, who was always having tea in a blue
cup, with a saucer that didn't match, enlarged the circle both of your
observations and your sensations. It was here, at any rate, that my
heroine spent many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) life; which is my excuse for this
topographical parenthesis.

<p/>Mrs. Almond lived much farther up town, in an embryonic street with a
high number--a region where the extension of the city began to assume a
theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the pavement -LRB-when there was
one-RRB-, and mingled their shade with the steep roofs of desultory Dutch
houses, and where pigs and chickens disported themselves in the gutter.
These elements of rural picturesqueness have now wholly departed from New
York street scenery; but they were to be found within the memory of
middle-aged persons, in quarters which now would blush to be reminded of
them. Catherine had a great many cousins, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) Aunt Almond's
children, who ended by being nine in number, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lived on terms of
considerable intimacy. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was younger they had been rather afraid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a
person who lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of
reflected grandeur. Mrs. Penniman, among the little Almonds, was an
object of more admiration than sympathy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) manners were strange and
formidable, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) mourning robes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) dressed in black for twenty years
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) husband's death, and then suddenly appeared one morning with
pink roses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cap--were complicated in odd, unexpected places with
buckles, bugles, and pins, which discouraged familiarity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) took
children too hard, both for good and for evil, and had an oppressive air
of expecting subtle things of them, so that going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was a good
deal like being taken to church and made to sit in a front pew. It was
discovered after a while, however, that Aunt Penniman was but an accident
in Catherine's existence, and not a part of its essence, and that when
the girl came to spend a Saturday with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousins, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was available for
<div class="bookquote">``follow-my-master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and even for leapfrog. On this basis an
understanding was easily arrived at, and for several years Catherine
fraternised with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) young kinsmen. I say young kinsmen, because seven
of the little Almonds were boys, and Catherine had a preference for those
games which are most conveniently played in trousers. By degrees,
however, the little Almonds' trousers began to lengthen, and the wearers
to disperse and settle themselves in life. The elder children were older
than Catherine, and the boys were sent to college or placed in
counting-rooms. Of the girls, one married very punctually, and the other
as punctually became engaged. It was to celebrate this latter event that
Mrs. Almond gave the little party I have mentioned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) daughter was to
marry a stout young stockbroker, a boy of twenty; it was thought a very
good thing.




<p/>IV


<p/>MRS. PENNIMAN, with more buckles and bangles than ever, came, of course,
to the entertainment, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>PENNIMAN</b></font>) niece; the Doctor, too, had
promised to look in later in the evening. There was to be a good deal of
dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up to
Catherine, in company with a tall young man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) introduced the young
man as a person who had a great desire to make our heroine's
acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur Townsend, her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) own intended.

<p/>Marian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a very small
figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose manners matrimony
had nothing to add. She (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) already had all the airs of a hostess, receiving
the company, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) fan, saying that with so many people to attend
to she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) should have no time to dance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) made a long speech about Mr.
Townsend's cousin, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) administered a tap with her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) fan before
turning away to other cares. Catherine had not understood all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attention was given to enjoying Marian's ease of manner and
flow of ideas, and to looking at the young man, who was remarkably
handsome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had succeeded, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) often failed to do when
people were presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), in catching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, which appeared to be
the same as that of Marian's little stockbroker. Catherine was always
agitated by an introduction; it seemed a difficult moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
wondered that some people--her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) new acquaintance at this moment, for
instance--should mind it so little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ought to say,
and what would be the consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saying nothing. The
consequences at present were very agreeable. Mr. Townsend, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a year.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a delightful party! What a charming house! What an interesting
family! What a pretty girl your cousin is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>These observations, in themselves of no great profundity, Mr. Townsend
seemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a contribution to an
acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) looked straight into Catherine's eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered
nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only listened, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) expected
no particular reply, went on to say many other things in the same
comfortable and natural manner. Catherine, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt tongue-tied,
was conscious of no embarrassment; it seemed proper that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should talk,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should simply look at him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). What made it natural was that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
was so handsome, or rather, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) phrased it to herself, so beautiful.
The music had been silent for a while, but it suddenly began again; and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with a deeper, intenser smile, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) the
honour of dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). Even to this inquiry she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave no audible
assent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) simply let him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waist--as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did so it
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) more vividly than it had ever done before, that this was
a singular place for a gentleman's arm to be--and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
guiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) round the room in the harmonious rotation of the polka. When
they paused she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was red; and then, for some moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stopped looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fanned herself, and looked at the flowers
that were painted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fan. He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would begin again, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated to answer, still looking at the flowers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does it make you dizzy?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) asked, in a tone of great kindness.

<p/>Then Catherine looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) was certainly beautiful, and not at
all red. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly knew why, for dancing had never
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dizzy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, in that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Townsend, <div class="bookquote">``we will sit still and talk.
I will find a good place to sit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) found a good place--a charming place; a little sofa that seemed meant
only for two persons. The rooms by this time were very full; the dancers
increased in number, and people stood close in front of them, turning
their backs, so that Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion seemed secluded and
unobserved. <div class="bookquote">``_We_ will talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man had said; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still did
all the talking. Catherine leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes fixed
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling and thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had features like
young men in pictures; Catherine had never seen such features--so
delicate, so chiselled and finished--among the young New Yorkers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
passed in the streets and met at parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tall and slim, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked extremely strong. Catherine thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a statue. But
a statue would not talk like that, and, above all, would not have eyes of
so rare a colour. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been at Mrs. Almond's before; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt
very much like a stranger; and it was very kind of Catherine to take pity
on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was Arthur Townsend's cousin--not very near; several times
removed--and Arthur had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) to the family. In
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was a great stranger in New York. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) native place; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had not been there for many years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had been knocking about the
world, and living in far-away lands; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had only come back a month or two
before. New York was very pleasant, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) felt lonely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, people forget you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) said, smiling at Catherine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
delightful gaze, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) leaned forward obliquely, turning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) knees.

<p/>It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) would ever
forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made this reflexion she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept it to herself,
almost as you would keep something precious.

<p/>They sat there for some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was very amusing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) about
the people that were near them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tried to guess who some of them were,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) made the most laughable mistakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) criticised them very freely,
in a positive, off-hand way. Catherine had never heard any
one--especially any young man--talk just like that. It was the way a young
man might talk in a novel; or better still, in a play, on the stage,
close before the footlights, looking at the audience, and with every one
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so that you wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence of mind. And yet
Mr. Townsend was not like an actor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) seemed so sincere, so natural.
This was very interesting; but in the midst of it Marian Almond came
pushing through the crowd, with a little ironical cry, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) found
these young people still together, which made every one turn round, and
cost Catherine a conscious blush. Marian broke up their talk, and told
Mr. Townsend--whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) treated as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) were already married, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had
become her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) cousin--to run away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) mother, who had been wishing for the
last half-hour to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to Mr. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall meet again!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) said to Catherine as he (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and Catherine
thought it a very original speech.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by the arm, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walk about. <div class="bookquote">``I needn't ask
you what you think of Morris!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you what you think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) name, but what you think of
himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian/Marian Almond</b></font>)</div>said Marian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing particular!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered, dissembling for the first
time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have half a mind to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marian/Marian Almond</b></font>)</div>cried Marian. <div class="bookquote">``It will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)'s so terribly conceited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conceited?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, staring.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine murmured imploringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'s conceited? I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) so a dozen times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>At this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) little
companion in amazement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) supposed it was because Marian was going to
be married that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) took so much on herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) wondered too,
whether, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) herself should become engaged, such exploits would be
expected of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>).

<p/>Half an hour later she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) Aunt Penniman sitting in the embrasure of
a window, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head a little on one side, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) gold eye-glass
raised to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes, which were wandering about the room. In front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
was a gentleman, bending forward a little, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back turned to
Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back immediately, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never seen it;
for when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), at Marian's instigation, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had retreated in
the best order, without turning round. Morris Townsend--the name had
already become very familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>), as if some one had been repeating it
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) ear for the last half-hour--Morris Townsend was giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
impressions of the company to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) aunt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had done to herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was
saying clever things, and Mrs. Penniman was smiling, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) approved
of them. As soon as Catherine had perceived this she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
would not have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to turn round and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
pleasure--the whole thing. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) should talk with Mrs. Penniman, with
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lived and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) saw and talked with every day--that seemed to
keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), and to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) even easier to contemplate than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
herself had been the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) civilities; and that Aunt Lavinia
should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), should not be shocked or startled by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said, this
also appeared to the girl a personal gain; for Aunt Lavinia's standard
was extremely high, planted as it was over the grave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) late husband,
in which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) had convinced every one, the very genius of conversation
was buried. One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), invited our
heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of an hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feet at
least were occupied. This time she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not dizzy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head was very
clear. Just when the dance was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found herself in the crowd face
to face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father. Dr. Sloper had usually a little smile, never a
very big one, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little smile playing in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) clear eyes and on
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neatly-shaved lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter's crimson gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible that this magnificent person is my child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.

<p/>You would have surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if you had told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so; but it is a literal
fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost never addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter save in the ironical
form. Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pleasure; but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had to cut
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pleasure out of the piece, as it were. There were portions left
over, light remnants and snippets of irony, which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never knew what to
do with, which seemed too delicate for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own use; and yet Catherine,
lamenting the limitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) understanding, felt that they were too
valuable to waste and had a belief that if they passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head they
yet contributed to the general sum of human wisdom.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not magnificent,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said mildly, wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had put on
another dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sumptuous, opulent, expensive,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``You look
as if you had eighty thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, so long as I haven't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine illogically. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conception
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) prospective wealth was as yet very indefinite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So long as you haven't you shouldn't look as if you had. Have you
enjoyed your party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine hesitated a moment; and then, looking away, <div class="bookquote">``I am rather
tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured. I have said that this entertainment was the
beginning of something important for Catherine. For the second time in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made an indirect answer; and the beginning of a period of
dissimulation is certainly a significant date. Catherine was not so
easily tired as that.

<p/>Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was as quiet as if
fatigue had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) portion. Dr. Sloper's manner of addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
sister Lavinia had a good deal of resemblance to the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had adopted
towards Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was the young man that was making love to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) presently asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my good brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Penniman, in deprecation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed uncommonly tender. Whenever I looked at you, for half an
hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had the most devoted air.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devotion was not to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``It was to Catherine;
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) talked to me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had been listening with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ears. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aunt Penniman!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
exclaimed faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very handsome; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very clever; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) expressed himself with a
great deal--a great deal of felicity,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is in love with this regal creature, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor inquired
humorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl, still more faintly, devoutly thankful the
carriage was dark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, <div class="bookquote">``My dress only?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Penniman's announcement struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by its richness, not by its
meagreness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks you have eighty thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is too
refined.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be tremendously refined not to think of that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine exclaimed, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had gone to sleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father answered. <div class="bookquote">``The hour has
come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added to himself. <div class="bookquote">``Lavinia is going to get up a romance for
Catherine. It's a shame to play such tricks on the girl. What is the
gentleman's name?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on, aloud.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't catch it, and I didn't like to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asked to be
introduced to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with a certain grandeur; <div class="bookquote">``but you
know how indistinctly Jefferson speaks.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Jefferson was Mr. Almond.
<div class="bookquote">``Catherine, dear, what was the gentleman's name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>For a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling of the carriage, you
might have heard a pin drop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Aunt Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, very softly. And, with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) irony, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).




<p/>V


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) learned what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had asked some three or four days later, after Morris
Townsend, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) cousin, had called in Washington Square. Mrs.
Penniman did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother, on the drive home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had
intimated to this agreeable young man, whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) did not know, that,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) should be very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was greatly
pleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on a Sunday afternoon,
the two gentlemen made their appearance. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming with Arthur Townsend
made it more natural and easy; the latter young man was on the point of
becoming connected with the family, and Mrs. Penniman had remarked to
Catherine that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to marry Marian, it would be polite in
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to call. These events came to pass late in the autumn, and Catherine
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt had been sitting together in the closing dusk, by the
firelight, in the high back parlour.

<p/>Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine's portion, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) companion placed
himself on the sofa, beside Mrs. Penniman. Catherine had hitherto not
been a harsh critic; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was easy to please--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked to talk with young
men. But Marian's betrothed, this evening, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) feel vaguely
fastidious; he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) sat looking at the fire and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) knees with his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>)
hands. As for Catherine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scarcely even pretended to keep up the
conversation; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attention had fixed itself on the other side of the
room; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was listening to what went on between the other Mr. Townsend
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt. Every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked over at Catherine herself and
smiled, as if to show that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) benefit too.
Catherine would have liked to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place, to go and sit near them,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might see and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) better. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was afraid of seeming
bold--of looking eager; and, besides, it would not have been polite to
Marian's little suitor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) wondered why the other gentleman had picked
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) aunt--how he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came to have so much to say to Mrs. Penniman, to
whom, usually, young men were not especially devoted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not at all
jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) was a little envious, and above all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
wondered; for Morris Townsend was an object on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
imagination could exercise itself indefinitely. His (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) cousin had been
describing a house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had taken in view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) union with Marian,
and the domestic conveniences he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) meant to introduce into it; how Marian
wanted a larger one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one, and how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) himself was convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had got the neatest house in New York.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's only for three or four years. At the
end of three or four years we'll move. That's the way to live in New
York--to move every three or four years. Then you always get the last
thing. It's because the city's growing so quick--you've got to keep up
with it. It's going straight up town--that's where New York's going. If
I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there--right up to the
top--and wait for it. Only have to wait ten years--they'd all come up
after you. But Marian says she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) wants some neighbours--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) doesn't want to
be a pioneer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) says that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>)'s got to be the first settler she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) had
better go out to Minnesota. I guess we'll move up little by little; when
we get tired of one street we'll go higher. So you see we'll always have
a new house; it's a great advantage to have a new house; you get all the
latest improvements. They invent everything all over again about every
five years, and it's a great thing to keep up with the new things. I
always try and keep up with the new things of every kind. Don't you
think that's a good motto for a young couple--to keep `going higher'?
That's the name of that piece of poetry--what do they call
it?--_Excelsior_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) junior visitor only just enough attention to
feel that this was not the way Mr. Morris Townsend had talked the other
night, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was talking now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fortunate aunt. But suddenly
his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) aspiring kinsman became more interesting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) seemed to have become
conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) companion's presence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
thought it proper to explain it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin asked me to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), or I shouldn't have taken the liberty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) seemed to want very much to come; you know he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s awfully sociable. I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) I wanted to ask you first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said Mrs. Penniman had invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) isn't particular what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) says when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wants to come somewhere!
But Mrs. Penniman seems to think it's all right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We are very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished to talk
more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly knew what to say. <div class="bookquote">``I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on presently.

<p/>Arthur Townsend stared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talked with you for over half an hour the other
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean before the other night. That was the first time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has been away from New York--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has been all round the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
doesn't know many people here, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s very sociable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wants to
know every one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean all the good ones. All the pretty young ladies--like Mrs.
Penniman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Townsend</b></font>)</div>and Arthur Townsend gave a private laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt likes him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most people like him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s so brilliant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s more like a foreigner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never knew a foreigner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said young Townsend, in a tone which
seemed to indicate that his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) ignorance had been optional.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither have I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine confessed, with more humility. <div class="bookquote">``They say
they are generally brilliant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added vaguely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, the people of this city are clever enough for me. I know some of
them that think they are too clever for me; but they ain't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you can't be too clever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, still with humility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I know some people that call my cousin too clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest, and a feeling
that if Morris Townsend had a fault it would naturally be that one. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not commit herself, and in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has
come back, will he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stay here always?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Arthur, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) can get something to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur/Arthur Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some place or other; some business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) got any?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, who had never heard of a young
man--of the upper class--in this situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)'s looking round. But he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) can't find anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine permitted herself to observe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) doesn't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said young Townsend. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) takes it easy--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) isn't
in a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is very particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) naturally would be, and gave herself up for some
moments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of its bearings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) father take him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) business--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) office?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at last
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hasn't got any father--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has only got a sister. Your sister can't
help you much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to Catherine that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) sister she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would disprove
this axiom. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pleasant?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s very respectable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said young Townsend.
And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked across to his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) cousin and began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Look here,
we are talking about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) added.

<p/>Morris Townsend paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) conversation with Mrs. Penniman, and
stared, with a little smile. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) got up, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) were going.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as you are concerned, I can't return the compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said to
Catherine's companion. <div class="bookquote">``But as regards Miss Sloper, it's another
affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
embarrassed by it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) also got up. Morris Townsend stood looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and smiling; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) hand for farewell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was going, without
having said anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but even on these terms she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was glad to have
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) what you have said--when you go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman,
with an insinuating laugh.

<p/>Catherine blushed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt almost as if they were making sport of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). What in the world could this beautiful young man have said? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blush; but very kindly and
respectfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had no talk with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and that was what I came for.
But it will be a good reason for coming another time; a little pretext--if
I am obliged to give one. I am not afraid of what your aunt will say
when I go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With this the two young men took their departure; after which Catherine,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blush still lingering, directed a serious and interrogative eye
to Mrs. Penniman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was incapable of elaborate artifice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
resorted to no jocular device--to no affectation of the belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
had been maligned--to learn what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) desired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did you say you would tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), smiling and nodding a little, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
all over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``It's a
great secret, my dear child; but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is coming a-courting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was serious still. <div class="bookquote">``Is that what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) didn't say so exactly. But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) left me to guess it. I'm a good
guesser.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean a-courting me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not me, certainly, miss; though I must say he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a hundred times more
polite to a person who has no longer extreme youth to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) than
most of the young men. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is thinking of some one else.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs.
Penniman gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece a delicate little kiss. <div class="bookquote">``You must be very
gracious to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine stared--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was bewildered. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't know me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does; more than you think. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) all about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aunt Penniman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>murmured Catherine, as if this had been a breach of
trust. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is a perfect stranger--we don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>There was
infinite, modesty in the poor girl's <div class="bookquote">``we.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Penniman, however, took no account of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) spoke even with a
touch of acrimony. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Catherine, you know very well that you
admire him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aunt Penniman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine could only murmur again. It might very
well be that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)--though this did not seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a thing to
talk about. But that this brilliant stranger--this sudden apparition, who
had barely heard the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voice--took that sort of interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that was expressed by the romantic phrase of which Mrs. Penniman had just
made use: this could only be a figment of the restless brain of Aunt
Lavinia, whom every one knew to be a woman of powerful imagination.




<p/>VI


<p/>MRS. PENNIMAN even took for granted at times that other people had as
much imagination as herself; so that when, half an hour later, her (<font color='blue'><b>PENNIMAN</b></font>)
brother came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>PENNIMAN</b></font>) addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) quite on this principle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has just been here, Austin; it's such a pity you missed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom in the world have I missed?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morris Townsend; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has made us such a delightful visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And who in the world is Mr. Morris Townsend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Penniman means the gentleman--the gentleman whose name I couldn't
remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The gentleman at Elizabeth's party who was so struck with Catherine,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name is Morris Townsend, is it? And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) come here to propose
to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl for all answer, turning away to the
window, where the dusk had deepened to darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't do that without your permission,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman,
very graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, my dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seems to have yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother answered.

<p/>Lavinia simpered, as if this might not be quite enough, and Catherine,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forehead touching the window-panes, listened to this exchange of
epigrams as reservedly as if they had not each been a pin-prick in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own destiny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor added, <div class="bookquote">``you had better call me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
might like to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend came again, some five days afterwards; but Dr. Sloper was
not called, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was absent from home at the time. Catherine was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt when the young man's name was brought in, and Mrs. Penniman,
effacing herself and protesting, made a great point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's going
into the drawing-room alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This time it's for you--for you only,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talked
to me, it was only preliminary--it was to gain my confidence. Literally,
my dear, I should not have the _courage_ to show myself to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And this was perfectly true. Mrs. Penniman was not a brave woman, and
Morris Townsend had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) as a young man of great force of
character, and of remarkable powers of satire; a keen, resolute,
brilliant nature, with which one must exercise a great deal of tact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
said to herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``imperious,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) liked the word and the
idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not the least jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had been
perfectly happy with Mr. Penniman, but in the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
permitted herself the observation: <div class="bookquote">``That's the sort of husband I should
have had!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was certainly much more imperious--she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) ended by calling it
imperial--than Mr. Penniman.

<p/>So Catherine saw Mr. Townsend alone, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt did not come in even at
the end of the visit. The visit was a long one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) sat there--in the
front parlour, in the biggest armchair--for more than an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) seemed
more at home this time--more familiar; lounging a little in the chair,
slapping a cushion that was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) stick, and looking round
the room a good deal, and at the objects it contained, as well as at
Catherine; whom, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) also contemplated freely. There was a smile
of respectful devotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) handsome eyes which seemed to Catherine
almost solemnly beautiful; it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) think of a young knight in a poem.
His (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) talk, however, was not particularly knightly; it was light and easy
and friendly; it took a practical turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) asked a number of
questions about herself--what were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tastes--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked this and
that--what were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habits. He (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) charming smile,
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me about yourself; give me a little sketch.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Catherine had very
little to tell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no talent for sketching; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) went
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had confided to him (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a secret passion for the theatre,
which had been but scantily gratified, and a taste for operatic
music--that of Bellini and Donizetti, in especial -LRB-it must be remembered
in extenuation of this primitive young woman that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held these opinions
in an age of general darkness-RRB---which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rarely had an occasion to hear,
except on the hand-organ. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not particularly
fond of literature. Morris Townsend agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that books were
tiresome things; only, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said, you had to read a good many before you
found it out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had been to places that people had written books about,
and they were not a bit like the descriptions. To see for yourself--that
was the great thing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) always tried to see for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had seen all
the principal actors--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had been to all the best theatres in London and
Paris. But the actors were always like the authors--they always
exaggerated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) liked everything to be natural. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) stopped,
looking at Catherine with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what I like you for; you are so natural! Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) added;
<div class="bookquote">``you see I am natural myself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had time to think whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) excused him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) or not--which
afterwards, at leisure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) became conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) began to
talk about music, and to say that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) greatest pleasure in life.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had heard all the great singers in Paris and London--Pasta and Rubini
and Lablache--and when you had done that, you could say that you knew what
singing was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I sing a little myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``some day I will show you. Not
to-day, but some other time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) got up to go; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had omitted, by accident, to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
would sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) thought of this after he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
got into the street; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) might have spared his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) compunction, for
Catherine had not noticed the lapse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was thinking only that <div class="bookquote">``some
other time''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>had a delightful sound; it seemed to spread itself over the
future.

<p/>This was all the more reason, however, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ashamed and
uncomfortable, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father that Mr. Morris Townsend
had called again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) announced the fact abruptly, almost violently, as
soon as the Doctor came into the house; and having done so--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
duty--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took measures to leave the room. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not leave it
fast enough; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reached the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) propose to you to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor asked.

<p/>This was just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would say; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no
answer ready. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have liked to take it as a joke--as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father must have meant it; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have liked, also, in denying
it, to be a little positive, a little sharp; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would perhaps not
ask the question again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) didn't like it--it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) unhappy. But
Catherine could never be sharp; and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only stood, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hand on the door-knob, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) satiric parent, and giving a little
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor to himself, <div class="bookquote">``my daughter is not brilliant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had no sooner made this reflexion than Catherine found something;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had decided, on the whole, to take the thing as a joke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will do it the next time!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, with a repetition
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) laugh. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quickly got out of the room.

<p/>The Doctor stood staring; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wondered whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter were serious.
Catherine went straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own room, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reached it
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bethought herself that there was something else--something better--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
might have said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) almost wished, now, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father would ask his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
question again, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might reply: <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, Mr. Morris Townsend
proposed to me, and I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor, however, began to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) questions elsewhere; it naturally
having occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ought to inform himself properly about
this handsome young man who had formed the habit of running in and out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) addressed himself to the younger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sisters, Mrs.
Almond--not going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) for the purpose; there was no such hurry as
that--but having made a note of the matter for the first opportunity. The
Doctor was never eager, never impatient nor nervous; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made notes of
everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) regularly consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) notes. Among them the
information he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) obtained from Mrs. Almond about Morris Townsend took its
place.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lavinia has already been to ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Lavinia is most
excited; I don't understand it. It's not, after all, Lavinia that the
young man is supposed to have designs upon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is very peculiar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor replied, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has not lived with me these
twelve years without my finding it out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has got such an artificial mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond, who always
enjoyed an opportunity to discuss Lavinia's peculiarities with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
brother. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) didn't want me to tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) had asked me about Mr.
Townsend; but I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) I would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) always wants to conceal
everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet at moments no one blurts things out with such crudity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is
like a revolving lighthouse; pitch darkness alternating with a dazzling
brilliancy! But what did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I tell you; that I know very little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lavinia must have been disappointed at that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>)
would prefer him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to have been guilty of some romantic crime. However, we
must make the best of people. They tell me our gentleman is the cousin
of the little boy to whom you are about to entrust the future of your
little girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Arthur is not a little boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is a very old man; you and I will never
be so old. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is a distant relation of Lavinia's _protégé_. The name is
the same, but I am given to understand that there are Townsends and
Townsends. So Arthur's mother tells me; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talked about
`branches'--younger branches, elder branches, inferior branches--as if it
were a royal house. Arthur, it appears, is of the reigning line, but
poor Lavinia's young man is not. Beyond this, Arthur's mother knows very
little about him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has only a vague story that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has been `wild.'
But I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sister a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a very nice woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name
is Mrs. Montgomery; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a widow, with a little property and five
children. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lives in the Second Avenue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does Mrs. Montgomery say about him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has talents by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) might distinguish himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is lazy, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) doesn't say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's family pride,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) profession?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hasn't got any; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is looking for something. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was once
in the Navy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Once? What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) age?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) is upwards of thirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) must have gone into the Navy very
young. I think Arthur told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) inherited a small property--which
was perhaps the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) leaving the Navy--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) spent it all in
a few years. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) travelled all over the world, lived abroad, amused
himself. I believe it was a kind of system, a theory he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) has
lately come back to America, with the intention, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tells Arthur, of
beginning life in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) in earnest about Catherine, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should be incredulous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond. <div class="bookquote">``It seems
to me that you have never done Catherine justice. You must remember that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has the prospect of thirty thousand a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister a moment, and then, with the slightest
touch of bitterness: <div class="bookquote">``You at least appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>sister moment</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said.

<p/>Mrs. Almond blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that is her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only merit; I simply mean that it is a great
one. A great many young men think so; and you appear to me never to have
been properly aware of that. You have always had a little way of
alluding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as an unmarriageable girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My allusions are as kind as yours, Elizabeth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor frankly.
<div class="bookquote">``How many suitors has Catherine had, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expectations--how much
attention has she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ever received? Catherine is not unmarriageable, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is absolutely unattractive. What other reason is there for Lavinia
being so charmed with the idea that there is a lover in the house? There
has never been one before, and Lavinia, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) sensitive, sympathetic
nature, is not used to the idea. It affects her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) imagination. I must do
the young men of New York the justice to say that they strike me as very
disinterested. They prefer pretty girls--lively girls--girls like your
own. Catherine is neither pretty nor lively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine does very well; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has a style of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own--which is more than
my poor Marian has, who has no style at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond. <div class="bookquote">``The
reason Catherine has received so little attention is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seems to
all the young men to be older than themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is so large, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
dresses--so richly. They are rather afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I think; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looks as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been married already, and you know they don't like married
women. And if our young men appear disinterested,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor's wiser
sister went on, <div class="bookquote">``it is because they marry, as a general thing, so young;
before twenty-five, at the age of innocence and sincerity, before the age
of calculation. If they only waited a little, Catherine would fare
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a calculation? Thank you very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till some intelligent man of forty comes along, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be
delighted with Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Townsend is not old enough, then; his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) motives may be pure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very possible that his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) motives are pure; I should be very sorry to
take the contrary for granted. Lavinia is sure of it, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is a
very prepossessing youth, you might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) the benefit of the doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sloper/DR. SLOPER</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Sloper reflected a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) present means of subsistence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) lives, as I say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A widow, with five children? Do you mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) lives _upon_ her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Almond got up, and with a certain impatience: <div class="bookquote">``Had you not better
ask Mrs. Montgomery herself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I may come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Did you say the Second
Avenue?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made a note of the Second Avenue.




<p/>VII


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was, however, by no means so much in earnest as this might seem to
indicate; and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was more than anything else amused with the
whole situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was not in the least in a state of tension or of
vigilance with regard to Catherine's prospects; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was even on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) guard
against the ridicule that might attach itself to the spectacle of a house
thrown into agitation by its daughter and heiress receiving attentions
unprecedented in its annals. More than this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went so far as to
promise himself some entertainment from the little drama--if drama it
was--of which Mrs. Penniman desired to represent the ingenious Mr.
Townsend as the hero. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had no intention, as yet, of regulating the
_dénouement_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was perfectly willing, as Elizabeth had suggested, to
give the young man the benefit of every doubt. There was no great danger
in it; for Catherine, at the age of twenty-two, was, after all, a rather
mature blossom, such as could be plucked from the stem only by a vigorous
jerk. The fact that Morris Townsend was poor--was not of necessity
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>); the Doctor had never made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) mind that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter
should marry a rich man. The fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would inherit struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as a
very sufficient provision for two reasonable persons, and if a penniless
swain who could give a good account of himself should enter the lists, he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>)
should be judged quite upon his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) personal merits. There were other things
besides. The Doctor thought it very vulgar to be precipitate in accusing
people of mercenary motives, inasmuch as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) door had as yet not been in
the least besieged by fortune-hunters; and, lastly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was very curious
to see whether Catherine might really be loved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moral worth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) reflected that poor Mr. Townsend had been only twice to the
house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said to Mrs. Penniman that the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) should come she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
must ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to dinner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) came very soon again, and Mrs. Penniman had of course great pleasure
in executing this mission. Morris Townsend accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) invitation with
equal good grace, and the dinner took place a few days later. The Doctor
had said to himself, justly enough, that they must not have the young man
alone; this would partake too much of the nature of encouragement. So
two or three other persons were invited; but Morris Townsend, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
was by no means the ostensible, was the real, occasion of the feast.
There is every reason to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) desired to make a good
impression; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) fell short of this result, it was not for want of a
good deal of intelligent effort. The Doctor talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) very little
during dinner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) attentively, and after the ladies had
gone out he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) the wine and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) several questions. Morris
was not a young man who needed to be pressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) found quite enough
encouragement in the superior quality of the claret. The Doctor's wine
was admirable, and it may be communicated to the reader that while he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>)
sipped it Morris reflected that a cellar-full of good liquor--there was
evidently a cellar-full here--would be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a
father-in-law. The Doctor was struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) appreciative guest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was not a commonplace young man. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has ability,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said
Catherine's father, <div class="bookquote">``decided ability; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has a very good head if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
chooses to use it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is uncommonly well turned out; quite the sort
of figure that pleases the ladies. But I don't think I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine father</b></font>)</div>The
Doctor, however, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) reflexions to himself, and talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
visitors about foreign lands, concerning which Morris offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) more
information than he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was ready, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) mentally phrased it, to swallow.
Dr. Sloper had travelled but little, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) took the liberty of not
believing everything this anecdotical idler narrated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) prided himself
on being something of a physiognomist, and while the young man, chatting
with easy assurance, puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass again, the
Doctor sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes quietly fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) bright, expressive face.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has the assurance of the devil himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris's host; <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think I ever saw such assurance. And his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) powers of invention are most
remarkable. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is very knowing; they were not so knowing as that in my
time. And a good head, did I say? I should think so--after a bottle of
Madeira and a bottle and a half of claret!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>After dinner Morris Townsend went and stood before Catherine, who was
standing before the fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) red satin gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) doesn't like me--he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) doesn't like me at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who doesn't like you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>asked Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father; extraordinary man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel; I am very quick to feel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are mistaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well; you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and you will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if there is any danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saying what
you think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with an air of mock melancholy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't give you any pleasure to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you hear me abused without opening your lips in my defence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father won't abuse you. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't know you enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Catherine began to blush again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never mention you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, to take refuge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) confusion.

<p/>``That is very well; but it is not quite what I should have liked you to
say. I should have liked you to say: `If my father doesn't think well of
you, what does it matter?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but it would matter; I couldn't say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl exclaimed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a moment, smiling a little; and the Doctor, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) just then, would have seen a gleam of fine
impatience in the sociable softness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eye. But there was no
impatience in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) rejoinder--none, at least, save what was expressed in a
little appealing sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, then, I must not give up the hope of
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) round!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) expressed it more frankly to Mrs. Penniman later in the evening. But
before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sang two or three songs at Catherine's timid request; not
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) flattered himself that this would help to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father round.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a sweet, light tenor voice, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had finished every one
made some exclamation--every one, that is, save Catherine, who remained
intensely silent. Mrs. Penniman declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner of singing was
<div class="bookquote">``most artistic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>and Dr. Sloper said it was <div class="bookquote">``very taking--very taking
indeed'' (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sloper/DR. SLOPER</b></font>)</div>; speaking loudly and distinctly, but with a certain dryness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't like me--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't like me at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris Townsend,
addressing the aunt in the same manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had done the niece. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thinks I'm all wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div><p/>Unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) niece, Mrs. Penniman asked for no explanation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) only
smiled very sweetly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) understood everything; and, unlike
Catherine too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made no attempt to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Pray, what does
it matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you say the right thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, greatly to the gratification
of Mrs. Penniman, who prided herself on always saying the right thing.

<p/>The Doctor, the next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister Elizabeth, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had made the acquaintance of Lavinia's _protégé_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Physically,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s uncommonly well set up. As an anatomist, it
is really a pleasure to me to see such a beautiful structure; although,
if people were all like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I suppose there would be very little need
for doctors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see anything in people but their bones?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond rejoined.
<div class="bookquote">``What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a father? Thank Heaven I am not his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but you are Catherine's. Lavinia tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) must get over it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not a gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, take care! Remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a branch of the Townsends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not what I call a gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has not the soul of one. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
extremely insinuating; but it's a vulgar nature. I saw through it in a
minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is altogether too familiar--I hate familiarity. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a
plausible coxcomb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond; <div class="bookquote">``if you make up your mind so easily, it's a
great advantage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't make up my mind easily. What I tell you is the result of thirty
years of observation; and in order to be able to form that judgement in a
single evening, I have had to spend a lifetime in study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possibly you are right. But the thing is for Catherine to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will present her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a pair of spectacles!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.




<p/>VIII


<p/>IF it were true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) was in love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) was certainly very quiet about
it; but the Doctor was of course prepared to admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) quietness
might mean volumes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) had told Morris Townsend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) would not
mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) saw no reason to retract this vow of
discretion. It was no more than decently civil, of course, that after
having dined in Washington Square, Morris should call there again; and it
was no more than natural that, having been kindly received on this
occasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should continue to present himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had had plenty of
leisure on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hands; and thirty years ago, in New York, a young man of
leisure had reason to be thankful for aids to self-oblivion. Catherine
said nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father about these visits, though they had rapidly
become the most important, the most absorbing thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life. The
girl was very happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not as yet what would come of it; but the
present had suddenly grown rich and solemn. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been told she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
in love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have been a good deal surprised; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had an idea
that love was an eager and exacting passion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own heart was filled
in these days with the impulse of self-effacement and sacrifice.
Whenever Morris Townsend had left the house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination projected
itself, with all its strength, into the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) soon coming back; but
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been told at such a moment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would not return for a
year, or even that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would never return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not have complained
nor rebelled, but would have humbly accepted the decree, and sought for
consolation in thinking over the times she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had already seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), the
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had spoken, the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) voice, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) tread, the expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) face. Love demands certain things as a right; but Catherine had
no sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rights; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had only a consciousness of immense and
unexpected favours. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very gratitude for these things had hushed
itself; for it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that there would be something of impudence
in making a festival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father suspected Morris
Townsend's visits, and noted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to beg pardon for
it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) constantly in silence, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meant to say that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said nothing because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was afraid of irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). But the poor
girl's dumb eloquence irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) more than anything else would have
done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) caught himself murmuring more than once that it was a
grievous pity his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) only child was a simpleton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) murmurs, however, were
inaudible; and for a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said nothing to any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would have
liked to know exactly how often young Townsend came; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had
determined to ask no questions of the girl herself--to say nothing more to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that would show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). The Doctor had a great idea of
being largely just: he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wished to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) liberty, and
interfere only when the danger should be proved. It was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
manner to obtain information by indirect methods, and it never even
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to question the servants. As for Lavinia, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hated to
talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) about the matter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) mock romanticism.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had to come to this. Mrs. Penniman's convictions as regards the
relations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece and the clever young visitor who saved appearances
by coming ostensibly for both the ladies--Mrs. Penniman's convictions had
passed into a riper and richer phase. There was to be no crudity in Mrs.
Penniman's treatment of the situation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had become as uncommunicative
as Catherine herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was tasting of the sweets of concealment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
had taken up the line of mystery. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would be enchanted to be able to
prove to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is persecuted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; and when at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would contrive to extract from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) words a pretext for this belief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be so good as to let me know what is going on in the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), in a tone which, under the circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) himself deemed genial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Going on, Austin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I am sure I don't
know! I believe that last night the old grey cat had kittens!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) age?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``The idea is startling--almost shocking.
Be so good as to see that they are all drowned. But what else has
happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the dear little kittens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have
them drowned for the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cigar a few moments in silence. <div class="bookquote">``Your sympathy
with kittens, Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) presently resumed, <div class="bookquote">``arises from a feline
element in your own character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cats are very graceful, and very clean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And very stealthy. You are the embodiment both of grace and of
neatness; but you are wanting in frankness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly are not, dear brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to be graceful, though I try to be neat. Why haven't
you let me know that Mr. Morris Townsend is coming to the house four
times a week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``Four times a week?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five times, if you prefer it. I am away all day, and I see nothing.
But when such things happen, you should let me know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyebrows still raised, reflected intently. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
Austin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I am incapable of betraying a confidence. I
would rather suffer anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never fear; you shall not suffer. To whose confidence is it you allude?
Has Catherine made you take a vow of eternal secrecy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means. Catherine has not told me as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has
not been very trustful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the young man, then, who has made you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidante? Allow me to
say that it is extremely indiscreet of you to form secret alliances with
young men. You don't know where they may lead you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by an alliance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``I take
a great interest in Mr. Townsend; I won't conceal that. But that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Under the circumstances, that is quite enough. What is the source of
your interest in Mr. Townsend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, musing, and then breaking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) smile,
<div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is so interesting!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS.

interesting?--his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) good looks?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) misfortunes, Austin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has had misfortunes? That, of course, is always interesting.
Are you at liberty to mention a few of Mr. Townsend's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS.

me a great deal about himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has told me, in fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) whole history.
But I don't think I ought to repeat those things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would tell them to
you, I am sure, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) thought you would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) kindly. With
kindness you may do anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor gave a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I shall request him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) very kindly, then, to
leave Catherine alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS.

little finger turned out, <div class="bookquote">``Catherine had probably said something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
kinder than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)? Do you mean that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``As I tell you, Austin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
doesn't confide in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an opinion, I suppose, all the same. It is that I ask you for;
though I don't conceal from you that I shall not regard it as
conclusive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman's gaze continued to rest on the carpet; but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
lifted it, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother thought it very expressive. <div class="bookquote">``I think
Catherine is very happy; that is all I can say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Townsend is trying to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--is that what you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is greatly interested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) finds her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) such an attractive girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine has a lovely nature, Austin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, <div class="bookquote">``and Mr.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With a little help from you, I suppose. My dear Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the
Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``you are an admirable aunt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Mr. Townsend says,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Aunt Lavinia</b></font>)</div>observed Lavinia, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is sincere?''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In saying that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; that's of course. But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) admiration for Catherine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Deeply sincere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has said to me the most appreciative, the most

would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)--gently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt whether I can undertake it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) appears to require a great deal

about his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) misfortunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a long story,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, <div class="bookquote">``and I regard it as a sacred

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's what has impoverished him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean simply in money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is very much alone in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has behaved so badly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) friends have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)

half-a-dozen nephews and nieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman was silent a minute. <div class="bookquote">``The nephews and nieces are children,
and the sister is not a very attractive person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) doesn't abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``for I am told he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
lives upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lives upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and does nothing for himself; it is about the same

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is looking for a position--most earnestly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS.

hopes every day to find one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is looking for it here--over there in the front parlour.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman was truly amiable, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) now gave signs of temper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
rose with much animation, and stood for a moment looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother.
<div class="bookquote">``My dear Austin,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``if you regard Catherine as a weak-minded

majestically away.




<p/>IX


<p/>IT was a regular custom with the family in Washington Square to go and
spend Sunday evening at Mrs. Almond's. On the Sunday after the
conversation I have just narrated, this custom was not intermitted and on
this occasion, towards the middle of the evening, Dr. Sloper found reason
to withdraw to the library, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brother-in-law, to talk over a
matter of business. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was absent some twenty minutes, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came
back into the circle, which was enlivened by the presence of several
friends of the family, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw that Morris Townsend had come in and had
lost as little time as possible in seating himself on a small sofa,
beside Catherine. In the large room, where several different groups had
been formed, and the hum of voices and of laughter was loud, these two
young persons might confabulate, as the Doctor phrased it to himself,
without attracting attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw in a moment, however, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
daughter was painfully conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own observation. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sat
motionless, with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eyes bent down, staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) open fan, deeply
flushed, shrinking together as if to minimise the indiscretion of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) confessed herself guilty.

<p/>The Doctor almost pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Poor Catherine was not defiant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no
genius for bravado; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
companion's attentions with an unsympathising eye, there was nothing but
discomfort for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in the accident of seeming to challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The
Doctor felt, indeed, so sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) turned away, to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
the sense of being watched; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was so intelligent a man that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) rendered a sort of poetic justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be deucedly pleasant for a plain inanimate girl like that to
have a beautiful young fellow come and sit down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and whisper to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slave--if that is what this one whispers. No wonder
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) likes it, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thinks me a cruel tyrant; which of course she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
does, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is afraid--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hasn't the animation necessary--to admit it
to herself. Poor old Catherine!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>mused the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``I verily believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
is capable of defending me when Townsend abuses me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>And the force of this reflexion, for the moment, was such in making him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
feel the natural opposition between his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) point of view and that of an
infatuated child, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was perhaps, after all,
taking things too hard and crying out before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was hurt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) must not
condemn Morris Townsend unheard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had a great aversion to taking
things too hard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) thought that half the discomfort and many of the
disappointments of life come from it; and for an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) asked himself
whether, possibly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) did not appear ridiculous to this intelligent young
man, whose private perception of incongruities he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) suspected of being
keen. At the end of a quarter of an hour Catherine had got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>),
and Townsend was now standing before the fireplace in conversation with
Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will try him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) crossed the room and
joined his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) companion, making her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should
leave the young man to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) presently did so, while Morris looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), smiling, without a sign of evasiveness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) affable eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)'s amazingly conceited!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>thought the Doctor; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said aloud:
<div class="bookquote">``I am told you are looking out for a position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a position is more than I should presume to call it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris
Townsend answered. <div class="bookquote">``That sounds so fine. I should like some quiet
work--something to turn an honest penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of thing should you prefer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean what am I fit for? Very little, I am afraid. I have
nothing but my good right arm, as they say in the melodramas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too modest,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``In addition to your good right
arm, you have your subtle brain. I know nothing of you but what I see;
but I see by your physiognomy that you are extremely intelligent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Townsend murmured, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what to answer when you say that!
You advise me, then, not to despair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) interlocutor as if the question might have a double
meaning. The Doctor caught the look and weighed it a moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
replied. <div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry to admit that a robust and
well-disposed young man need ever despair. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't succeed in one
thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can try another. Only, I should add, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should choose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) line
with discretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes, with discretion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris Townsend repeated sympathetically.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I have been indiscreet, formerly; but I think I have got over it.
I am very steady now.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) stood a moment, looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
remarkably neat shoes. Then at last, <div class="bookquote">``Were you kindly intending to
propose something for my advantage?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) inquired, looking up and smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impudence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor exclaimed privately. But in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) himself had, after all, touched first upon this
delicate point, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) words might have been construed as an offer
of assistance. <div class="bookquote">``I have no particular proposal to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) presently
said; <div class="bookquote">``but it occurred to me to let you know that I have you in my mind.
Sometimes one hears of opportunities. For instance--should you object to
leaving New York--to going to a distance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I shouldn't be able to manage that. I must seek my fortune
here or nowhere. You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>added Morris Townsend, <div class="bookquote">``I have ties--I have
responsibilities here. I have a sister, a widow, from whom I have been
separated for a long time, and to whom I am almost everything. I
shouldn't like to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) that I must leave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) rather depends
upon me, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's very proper; family feeling is very proper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sloper/DR. SLOPER</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Sloper.
<div class="bookquote">``I often think there is not enough of it in our city. I think I have
heard of your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is possible, but I rather doubt it; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lives so very quietly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As quietly, you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor went on, with a short laugh, <div class="bookquote">``as a
lady may do who has several young children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my little nephews and nieces--that's the very point! I am helping to
bring them up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris Townsend. <div class="bookquote">``I am a kind of amateur tutor; I
give them lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very proper, as I say; but it is hardly a career.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't make my fortune!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not be too much bent on a fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``But I
assure you I will keep you in mind; I won't lose sight of you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If my situation becomes desperate I shall perhaps take the liberty of
reminding you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris rejoined, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) voice a little, with a
brighter smile, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) interlocutor turned away.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) left the house the Doctor had a few words with Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do you call her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? Mrs.
Montgomery. I should like to have a little talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try and manage it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond responded. <div class="bookquote">``I will take the
first opportunity of inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>), and you shall come and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>).
Unless, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond added, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) first takes it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) head to
be sick and to send for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah no, not that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) must have trouble enough without that. But it
would have its advantages, for then I should see the children. I should
like very much to see the children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very thorough. Do you want to catechise them about their
uncle!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. Their uncle tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has charge of their education, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saves their mother the expense of school-bills. I should like to ask
them a few questions in the commoner branches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) certainly has not the cut of a schoolmaster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond said to
herself a short time afterwards, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) saw Morris Townsend in a corner
bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) niece, who was seated.

<p/>And there was, indeed, nothing in the young man's discourse at this
moment that savoured of the pedagogue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you meet me somewhere to-morrow or next day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a low
tone, to Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meet you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) frightened eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something particular to say to you--very particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you come to the house? Can't you say it there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Townsend shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) head gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``I can't enter your doors again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Townsend!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>murmured Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered
what had happened, whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had forbidden it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't in self-respect,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``Your father has insulted
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Insulted you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has taunted me with my poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are mistaken--you misunderstood him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine spoke with
energy, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I am too proud--too sensitive. But would you have me otherwise?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked tenderly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where my father is concerned, you must not be sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is full of
goodness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laughed at me for having no position! I took it quietly; but only
because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) belongs to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks. I am sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means to be kind. You must not be too proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be proud only of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris answered. <div class="bookquote">``Will you meet me in the
Square in the afternoon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>A great blush on Catherine's part had been the answer to the declaration
I have just quoted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away, heedless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you meet me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``It is very quiet there; no one need
see us--toward dusk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, when you say such things
as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how little there is in me to be proud of. I am ugly and
stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recognised
nothing articulate but an assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own dearest.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I am not even--I am not even--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) paused a
moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not even brave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, if you are afraid, what shall we do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated a while; then at last--<div class="bookquote">``You must come to the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``I am not afraid of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather it were in the Square,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man urged. <div class="bookquote">``You know
how empty it is, often. No one will see us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care who sees us! But leave me now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resignedly; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted. Fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
ignorant that half an hour later, going home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father and feeling
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) near, the poor girl, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sudden declaration of courage,
began to tremble again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father said nothing; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had an idea his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
eyes were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in the darkness. Mrs. Penniman also was silent;
Morris Townsend had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece preferred, unromantically, an
interview in a chintz-covered parlour to a sentimental tryst beside a
fountain sheeted with dead leaves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was lost in wonderment at the
oddity--almost the perversity--of the choice.




<p/>X


<p/>CATHERINE received the young man the next day on the ground she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) had
chosen--amid the chaste upholstery of a New York drawing-room furnished in
the fashion of fifty years ago. Morris had swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) pride and made
the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) too derisive parent--an
act of magnanimity which could not fail to render him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) doubly interesting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must settle something--we must take a line,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) declared, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hair and giving a glance at the long narrow mirror which
adorned the space between the two windows, and which had at its base a
little gilded bracket covered by a thin slab of white marble, supporting
in its turn a backgammon board folded together in the shape of two
volumes, two shining folios inscribed in letters of greenish gilt,
_History of England_. If Morris had been pleased to describe the master
of the house as a heartless scoffer, it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) too
much on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) guard, and this was the easiest way to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own
dissatisfaction--a dissatisfaction which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had made a point of concealing
from the Doctor. It will probably seem to the reader, however, that the
Doctor's vigilance was by no means excessive, and that these two young
people had an open field. Their intimacy was now considerable, and it
may appear that for a shrinking and retiring person our heroine had been
liberal of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) favours. The young man, within a few days, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
listen to things for which she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) had not supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was prepared;
having a lively foreboding of difficulties, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proceeded to gain as much
ground as possible in the present. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered that fortune favours
the brave, and even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten it, Mrs. Penniman would have
remembered it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a drama,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) flattered herself that a drama would now be enacted. Combining
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) did the zeal of the prompter with the impatience of the spectator,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had long since done her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) utmost to pull up the curtain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) too
expected to figure in the performance--to be the confidante, the Chorus,
to speak the epilogue. It may even be said that there were times when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the play, in the
contemplation of certain great passages which would naturally occur
between the hero and herself.

<p/>What Morris had told Catherine at last was simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), or
rather adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Virtually, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had made known as much already--his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
visits had been a series of eloquent intimations of it. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had
affirmed it in lover's vows, and, as a memorable sign of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had
passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) arm round the girl's waist and taken a kiss. This happy
certitude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had regarded
it, very naturally, as a priceless treasure. It may even be doubted
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ever definitely expected to possess it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not been
waiting for it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never said to herself that at a given moment
it must come. As I have tried to explain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not eager and
exacting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took what was given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from day to day; and if the
delightful custom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover's visits, which yielded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a happiness in
which confidence and timidity were strangely blended, had suddenly come
to an end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not only not have spoken of herself as one of the
forsaken, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not have thought of herself as one of the
disappointed. After Morris had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as a ripe assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) devotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) to go away, to
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) think. Morris went away, taking another kiss
first. But Catherine's meditations had lacked a certain coherence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) kisses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks for a long time afterwards;
the sensation was rather an obstacle than an aid to reflexion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
have liked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation all clearly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
mind what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should do if, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feared, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disapproved of Morris Townsend. But all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could see with
any vividness was that it was terribly strange that anyone should
disapprove of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); that there must in that case be some mistake, some
mystery, which in a little while would be set at rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put off
deciding and choosing; before the vision of a conflict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes and sat motionless, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breath and waiting.
It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart beat, it was intensely painful. When Morris kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
and said these things--that also made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart beat; but this was worse,
and it frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Nevertheless, to-day, when the young man spoke of
settling something, taking a line, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt that it was the truth, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered very simply and without hesitating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must do our duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we must speak to my father. I will do
it to-night; you must do it to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very good of you to do it first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris answered. <div class="bookquote">``The young
man--the happy lover--generally does that. But just as you please!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>It pleased Catherine to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should be brave for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sake, and
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even gave a little smile. <div class="bookquote">``Women have more
tact,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``they ought to do it first. They are more conciliating;
they can persuade better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will need all your powers of persuasion. But, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris
added, <div class="bookquote">``you are irresistible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't speak that way--and promise me this. To-morrow, when you
talk with father, you will be very gentle and respectful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much so as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris promised. <div class="bookquote">``It won't be much use, but I
shall try. I certainly would rather have you easily than have to fight
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk about fighting; we shall not fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, we must be prepared,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris rejoined; <div class="bookquote">``you especially, because for
you it must come hardest. Do you know the first thing your father will
say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Morris; please tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will tell you I am mercenary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercenary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a big word; but it means a low thing. It means that I am after
your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>murmured Catherine softly.

<p/>The exclamation was so deprecating and touching that Morris indulged in
another little demonstration of affection. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will be sure to say
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be easy to be prepared for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
simply say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is mistaken--that other men may be that way, but that
you are not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must make a great point of that, for it will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own great
point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover a minute, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). But I am glad we shall be rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added.

<p/>Morris turned away, looking into the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``No, it's a
misfortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``It is from that our difficulty will
come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so unhappy. Many people
would not think it so bad. I will persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), and after that we shall
be very glad we have money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend listened to this robust logic in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I will leave
my defence to you; it's a charge that a man has to stoop to defend
himself from.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) side was silent for a while; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked, with a good deal of fixedness, out of the window.
<div class="bookquote">``Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``are you very sure you love me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) turned round, and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My own
dearest, can you doubt it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only known it five days,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but now it seems to me as if
I could never do without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never be called upon to try!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) gave a little tender,
reassuring laugh. Then, in a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``There is something you
must tell me, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes after the last word she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
uttered, and kept them closed; and at this she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head, without
opening them. <div class="bookquote">``You must tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that if your father is
dead against me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absolutely forbids our marriage, you will still be
faithful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could give no better
promise than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) read there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will cleave to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``You know you are your own
mistress--you are of age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Morris!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured, for all answer. Or rather not for all; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) kept it a while, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again. This is all that need be recorded of their
conversation; but Mrs. Penniman, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had been present, would probably
have admitted that it was as well it had not taken place beside the

<p/>CATHERINE listened for her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) father when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came in that evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>)
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) study. She (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) sat quiet, though her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) heart was beating
fast, for nearly half an hour; then she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) went and knocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) door--a
ceremony without which she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) never crossed the threshold of this apartment.
On entering it now she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair beside the fire,
entertaining himself with a cigar and the evening paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) began very gently; and she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) sat down
in the first place that offered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be very happy to hear it, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
waited--waited, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) stared, in a long silence, at
the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was curious and impatient, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) was going to
speak of Morris Townsend; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) own time, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was
determined to be very mild.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am engaged to be married!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine announced at last, still staring
at the fire.

<p/>The Doctor was startled; the accomplished fact was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had
expected. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) betrayed no surprise. <div class="bookquote">``You do right to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
simply said. <div class="bookquote">``And who is the happy mortal whom you have honoured with
your choice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morris Townsend.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover's name, Catherine
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). What she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's still grey eye and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
clear-cut, definite smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) contemplated these objects for a moment,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked back at the fire; it was much warmer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When was this arrangement made?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This afternoon--two hours ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Mr. Townsend here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father; in the front parlour.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not
obliged to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) that the ceremony of their betrothal had taken place
out there under the bare ailantus-trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very serious, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Townsend ought to have told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) means to tell you to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After I know all about it from you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) ought to have told me before.
Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) think I didn't care--because I left you so much liberty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) knew you would care. And we have been so
much obliged to you for--for the liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor gave a short laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You might have made a better use of it,
Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't say that, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl urged softly, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dull
and gentle eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cigar awhile, meditatively. <div class="bookquote">``You have gone very fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered simply; <div class="bookquote">``I think we have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) an instant, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes from the fire.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't wonder Mr. Townsend likes you. You are so simple and so good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why it is--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) _does_ like me. I am sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you very fond of Mr. Townsend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) very much, of course--or I shouldn't consent to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) a very short time, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with some eagerness, <div class="bookquote">``it doesn't take long to like
a person--when once you begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have begun very quickly. Was it the first time you saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)--that night at your aunt's party?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl answered. <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you about
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course; that's your own affair. You will have observed that I have
acted on that principle. I have not interfered, I have left you your
liberty, I have remembered that you are no longer a little girl--that you
have arrived at years of discretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel very old--and very wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, smiling faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that before long you will feel older and wiser yet. I don't
like your engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine exclaimed softly, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. I am sorry to give you pain; but I don't like it. You
should have consulted me before you settled it. I have been too easy
with you, and I feel as if you had taken advantage of my indulgence.
Most decidedly, you should have spoken to me first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine hesitated a moment, and then--<div class="bookquote">``It was because I was afraid you
wouldn't like it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) confessed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there it is! You had a bad conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have not a bad conscience, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl cried out, with
considerable energy. <div class="bookquote">``Please don't accuse me of anything so dreadful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These words, in fact, represented to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) imagination something very
terrible indeed, something base and cruel, which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) associated with
malefactors and prisoners. <div class="bookquote">``It was because I was afraid--afraid--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were afraid, it was because you had been foolish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you didn't like Mr. Townsend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were quite right. I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear father, you don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, in a voice so timidly
argumentative that it might have touched him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intimately. But I know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enough. I have
my impression of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood before the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands lightly clasped in front of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chair and looking up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
made this remark with a placidity that might have been irritating.

<p/>I doubt, however, whether Catherine was irritated, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke into
a vehement protest. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I know
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--better than I have ever known any one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know a part of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has chosen to show you. But you don't
know the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rest? What is the rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever it may be. There is sure to be plenty of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, remembering how Morris had
forewarned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is mercenary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cold, quiet reasonable eye.
<div class="bookquote">``If I meant it, my dear, I should say it! But there is an error I wish
particularly to avoid--that of rendering Mr. Townsend more interesting to
you by saying hard things about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't think them hard if they are true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't, you will be a remarkably sensible young woman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will be your reasons, at any rate, and you will want me to hear
your reasons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor smiled a little. <div class="bookquote">``Very true. You have a perfect right to ask
for them.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cigar a few moments. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, then,
without accusing Mr. Townsend of being in love only with your fortune--and
with the fortune that you justly expect--I will say that there is every
reason to suppose that these good things have entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
calculation more largely than a tender solicitude for your happiness
strictly requires. There is, of course, nothing impossible in an
intelligent young man entertaining a disinterested affection for you.
You are an honest, amiable girl, and an intelligent young man might
easily find it out. But the principal thing that we know about this
young man--who is, indeed, very intelligent--leads us to suppose that,
however much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may value your personal merits, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) values your money
more. The principal thing we know about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has led a life of
dissipation, and has spent a fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own in doing so. That is
enough for me, my dear. I wish you to marry a young man with other
antecedents--a young man who could give positive guarantees. If Morris
Townsend has spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) own fortune in amusing himself, there is every
reason to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would spend yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor delivered himself of these remarks slowly, deliberately, with
occasional pauses and prolongations of accent, which made no great
allowance for poor Catherine's suspense as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) conclusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat
down at last, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head bent and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes still fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); and
strangely enough--I hardly know how to tell it--even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt that
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said went so terribly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admired his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) neatness and
nobleness of expression. There was something hopeless and oppressive in
having to argue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) side, must try to be
clear. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so quiet; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not at all angry; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too must be
quiet. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very effort to be quiet made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tremble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not the principal thing we know about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; and there
was a touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``There are other things--many
other things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has very high abilities--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wants so much to do
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is kind, and generous, and true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said poor Catherine, who
had not suspected hitherto the resources of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eloquence. <div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
fortune--his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) fortune that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) spent--was very small!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the more reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) shouldn't have spent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the Doctor,
getting up, with a laugh. Then as Catherine, who had also risen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
feet again, stood there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rather angular earnestness, wishing so
much and expressing so little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``You won't think me cruel?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a moment.

<p/>This question was not reassuring; it seemed to Catherine, on the
contrary, to suggest possibilities which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel sick. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
answered coherently enough--<div class="bookquote">``No, dear father; because if you knew how I
feel--and you must know, you know everything--you would be so kind, so
gentle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I know how you feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor said. <div class="bookquote">``I will be very
kind--be sure of that. And I will see Mr. Townsend to-morrow. Meanwhile,
and for the present, be so good as to mention to no one that you are
engaged.''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>XII


<p/>ON the morrow, in the afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stayed at home, awaiting Mr.
Townsend's call--a proceeding by which it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) -LRB-justly perhaps,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was a very busy man-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) paid Catherine's suitor great honour,
and gave both these young people so much the less to complain of. Morris
presented himself with a countenance sufficiently serene--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) appeared to
have forgotten the <div class="bookquote">``insult''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had solicited Catherine's
sympathy two evenings before, and Dr. Sloper lost no time in letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had been prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine told me yesterday what has been going on between you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``You must allow me to say that it would have been becoming of you
to give me notice of your intentions before they had gone so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have done so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris answered, <div class="bookquote">``if you had not had so much the
appearance of leaving your daughter at liberty. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seems to me quite
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own mistress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Literally, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is. But she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has not emancipated herself morally quite so
far, I trust, as to choose a husband without consulting me. I have left
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) at liberty, but I have not been in the least indifferent. The truth
is that your little affair has come to a head with a rapidity that
surprises me. It was only the other day that Catherine made your
acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not long ago, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, with great gravity. <div class="bookquote">``I
admit that we have not been slow to--to arrive at an understanding. But
that was very natural, from the moment we were sure of ourselves--and of
each other. My interest in Miss Sloper began the first time I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did it not by chance precede your first meeting?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor asked.

<p/>Morris looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I certainly had already heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>)
was a charming girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A charming girl--that's what you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly. Otherwise I should not be sitting here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor meditated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``My dear young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said at last,
<div class="bookquote">``you must be very susceptible. As Catherine's father, I have, I trust, a
just and tender appreciation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) many good qualities; but I don't mind
telling you that I have never thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as a charming girl, and
never expected any one else to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend received this statement with a smile that was not wholly
devoid of deference. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I might think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if I were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father. I can't put myself in that place. I speak from my own point
of view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; <div class="bookquote">``but that is not all that is
necessary. I told Catherine yesterday that I disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) let me know as much, and I was very sorry to hear it. I am greatly
disappointed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And Morris sat in silence awhile, looking at the floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you really expect I would say I was delighted, and throw my daughter
into your arms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; I had an idea you didn't like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What gave you the idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact that I am poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has a harsh sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``but it is about the
truth--speaking of you strictly as a son-in-law. Your absence of means,
of a profession, of visible resources or prospects, places you in a
category from which it would be imprudent for me to select a husband for
my daughter, who is a weak young woman with a large fortune. In any
other capacity I am perfectly prepared to like you. As a son-in-law, I
abominate you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend listened respectfully. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think Miss Sloper is a
weak woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) presently said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you must defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>)--it's the least you can do. But I have
known my child twenty years, and you have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) six weeks. Even if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) were not weak, however, you would still be a penniless man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes; that is _my_ weakness! And therefore, you mean, I am
mercenary--I only want your daughter's money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't say that. I am not obliged to say it; and to say it, save under
stress of compulsion, would be very bad taste. I say simply that you
belong to the wrong category.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your daughter doesn't marry a category,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Townsend urged, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
handsome smile. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marries an individual--an individual whom she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is so
good as to say she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) loves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An individual who offers so little in return!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible to offer more than the most tender affection and a
lifelong devotion?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It depends how we take it. It is possible to offer a few other things
besides; and not only is it possible, but it's usual. A lifelong
devotion is measured after the fact; and meanwhile it is customary in
these cases to give a few material securities. What are yours? A very
handsome face and figure, and a very good manner. They are excellent as
far as they go, but they don't go far enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one thing you should add to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris; <div class="bookquote">``the word of a
gentleman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The word of a gentleman that you will always love Catherine? You must
be a very fine gentleman to be sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The word of a gentleman that I am not mercenary; that my affection for
Miss Sloper is as pure and disinterested a sentiment as was ever lodged
in a human breast! I care no more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) fortune than for the ashes in
that grate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take note--I take note,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``But having done so, I turn
to our category again. Even with that solemn vow on your lips, you take
your place in it. There is nothing against you but an accident, if you
will; but with my thirty years' medical practice, I have seen that
accidents may have far-reaching consequences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat--it was already remarkably glossy--and continued to
display a self-control which, as the Doctor was obliged to admit, was
extremely creditable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) disappointment was evidently keen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there nothing I can do to make you believe in me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there were I should be sorry to suggest it, for--don't you see?--I
don't want to believe in you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would go and dig in the fields.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take the first work that offers, to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do so by all means--but for your own sake, not for mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see; you think I am an idler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris exclaimed, a little too much in
the tone of a man who has made a discovery. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) error
immediately, and blushed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter what I think, when once I have told you I don't think
of you as a son-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>But Morris persisted. <div class="bookquote">``You think I would squander her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor smiled. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter, as I say; but I plead guilty to
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's because I spent my own, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``I frankly
confess that. I have been wild. I have been foolish. I will tell you
every crazy thing I ever did, if you like. There were some great follies
among the number--I have never concealed that. But I have sown my wild
oats. Isn't there some proverb about a reformed rake? I was not a rake,
but I assure you I have reformed. It is better to have amused oneself
for a while and have done with it. Your daughter would never care for a
milksop; and I will take the liberty of saying that you would like one
quite as little. Besides, between my money and hers there is a great
difference. I spent my own; it was because it was my own that I spent
it. And I made no debts; when it was gone I stopped. I don't owe a
penny in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to inquire what you are living on now--though I admit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the
Doctor added, <div class="bookquote">``that the question, on my part, is inconsistent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am living on the remnants of my property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris Townsend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor gravely replied.

<p/>Yes, certainly, Morris's self-control was laudable. <div class="bookquote">``Even admitting I
attach an undue importance to Miss Sloper's fortune,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``would
not that be in itself an assurance that I should take much care of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you should take too much care would be quite as bad as that you
should take too little. Catherine might suffer as much by your economy
as by your extravagance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are very unjust!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man made this declaration
decently, civilly, without violence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your privilege to think so, and I surrender my reputation to you!
I certainly don't flatter myself I gratify you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you care a little to gratify your daughter? Do you enjoy the idea
of making her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) miserable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly resigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thinking me a tyrant for a twelvemonth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For a twelvemonth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Morris, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For a lifetime, then! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may as well be miserable in that way as in
the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Here at last Morris lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) temper. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are not polite, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You push me to it--you argue too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a great deal at stake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whatever it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``you have lost it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>asked Morris; <div class="bookquote">``are you sure your daughter will
give me up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, of course, you have lost it as far as I am concerned. As for
Catherine's giving you up--no, I am not sure of it. But as I shall
strongly recommend it, as I have a great fund of respect and affection in
my daughter's mind to draw upon, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has the sentiment of duty
developed in a very high degree, I think it extremely possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris Townsend began to smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) hat again. <div class="bookquote">``I too have a fund of
affection to draw upon!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) observed at last.

<p/>The Doctor at this point showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own first symptoms of irritation.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to defy me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Call it what you please, sir! I mean not to give your daughter up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least fear of your pining away
your life. You are made to enjoy it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris gave a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Your opposition to my marriage is all the more
cruel, then! Do you intend to forbid your daughter to see me again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is past the age at which people are forbidden, and I am not a father
in an old-fashioned novel. But I shall strongly urge her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to break with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris Townsend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. But I shall have done what I could.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has gone too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To retreat? Then let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stop where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too far to stop, I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) a moment; Morris had his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hand on the door.
<div class="bookquote">``There is a great deal of impertinence in your saying it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will say no more, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris answered; and, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) bow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) left
the room.




<p/>XIII


<p/>IT may be thought the Doctor was too positive, and Mrs. Almond intimated
as much. But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) impression; it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
sufficient, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had no wish to modify it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) life in
estimating people -LRB-it was part of the medical trade-RRB-, and in nineteen
cases out of twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Mr. Townsend is the twentieth case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond suggested.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) doesn't look to me at all like a twentieth
case. But I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) the benefit of the doubt, and, to make sure, I
will go and talk with Mrs. Montgomery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) will almost certainly tell me
I have done right; but it is just possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) will prove to me that
I have made the greatest mistake of my life. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) does, I will beg Mr.
Townsend's pardon. You needn't invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) to meet me, as you kindly
proposed; I will write her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) a frank letter, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) how matters stand,
and asking leave to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your side. The poor little
woman will stand up for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may be? I doubt that. People are not always so fond of
their brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond, <div class="bookquote">``when it's a question of thirty thousand a year
coming into a family--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stands up for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on account of the money, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be a humbug.
If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a humbug I shall see it. If I see it, I won't waste time with
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not a humbug--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is an exemplary woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will not wish to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is worth talking to, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will sooner play him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a trick than that

she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) know her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to my knowledge. Mr. Townsend can have had no particular interest

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is an exemplary woman, no. But we shall see to what extent she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) takes everything--as a matter of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) make a noise? Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made a scene?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has a talent for being in the wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond. <div class="bookquote">``But I am

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I count upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has such an admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) can't choose, all the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) will stand there entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to choose, and Lavinia will

better be careful,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I will have no treason in my

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) will be careful; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is at bottom very much afraid of

it is on that that I build--on the salutary terror I inspire!''




 (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div><p/>XIV


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) frank letter to Mrs. Montgomery, who punctually answered it,
mentioning an hour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) might present himself in the Second
Avenue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) lived in a neat little house of red brick, which had been
freshly painted, with the edges of the bricks very sharply marked out in
white. It has now disappeared, with its companions, to make room for a
row of structures more majestic. There were green shutters upon the
windows, without slats, but pierced with little holes, arranged in
groups; and before the house was a diminutive yard, ornamented with a
bush of mysterious character, and surrounded by a low wooden paling,
painted in the same green as the shutters. The place looked like a
magnified baby-house, and might have been taken down from a shelf in a
toy-shop. Dr. Sloper, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went to call, said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
glanced at the objects I have enumerated, that Mrs. Montgomery was
evidently a thrifty and self-respecting little person--the modest
proportions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) dwelling seemed to indicate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was of small
stature--who took a virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy, and had
resolved that, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) might not be splendid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) would at least be
immaculate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in a little parlour, which was precisely
the parlour he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had expected: a small unspeckled bower, ornamented with a
desultory foliage of tissue-paper, and with clusters of glass drops, amid
which--to carry out the analogy--the temperature of the leafy season was
maintained by means of a cast-iron stove, emitting a dry blue flame, and
smelling strongly of varnish. The walls were embellished with engravings
swathed in pink gauze, and the tables ornamented with volumes of extracts
from the poets, usually bound in black cloth stamped with florid designs
in jaundiced gilt. The Doctor had time to take cognisance of these
details, for Mrs. Montgomery, whose conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pronounced under the
circumstances inexcusable, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) waiting some ten minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
appeared. At last, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) rustled in, smoothing down a stiff
poplin dress, with a little frightened flush in a gracefully-rounded
cheek.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was a small, plump, fair woman, with a bright, clear eye, and an
extraordinary air of neatness and briskness. But these qualities were
evidently combined with an unaffected humility, and the Doctor gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) esteem as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>). A brave little person, with
lively perceptions, and yet a disbelief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) own talent for social, as
distinguished from practical, affairs--this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) rapid mental _résumé_
of Mrs. Montgomery, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw, was flattered by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) regarded as
the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) visit. Mrs. Montgomery, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) little red house in the
Second Avenue, was a person for whom Dr. Sloper was one of the great men,
one of the fine gentlemen of New York; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) agitated
eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) mittened hands together in her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
glossy poplin lap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) had the appearance of saying to herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
quite answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) idea of what a distinguished guest would naturally be.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) apologised for being late; but he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``for while I sat here I had time to think
over what I wish to say to you, and to make up my mind how to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, do begin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not so easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You will have gathered
from my letter that I wish to ask you a few questions, and you may not
find it very comfortable to answer them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have thought what I should say. It is not very easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must understand my situation--my state of mind. Your brother
wishes to marry my daughter, and I wish to find out what sort of a young
man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is. A good way to do so seemed to be to come and ask you; which I
have proceeded to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously; she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was in a
state of extreme moral concentration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) pretty eyes, which
were illumined by a sort of brilliant modesty, attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own
countenance, and evidently paid the most earnest attention to each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
words. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) expression indicated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) idea of coming to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) a very superior conception, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was really afraid to
have opinions on strange subjects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extremely glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) said, in a tone which seemed to
admit, at the same time, that this had nothing to do with the question.

<p/>The Doctor took advantage of this admission. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come to see you
for your pleasure; I came to make you say disagreeable things--and you
can't like that. What sort of a gentleman is your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery's illuminated gaze grew vague, and began to wander. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
smiled a little, and for some time made no answer, so that the Doctor at
last became impatient. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) answer, when it came, was not
satisfactory. <div class="bookquote">``It is difficult to talk about one's brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when one is fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and when one has plenty of good to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, even then, when a good deal depends on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing depends on it, for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean for--for--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For your brother himself. I see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean for Miss Sloper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery. The Doctor liked this;
it had the accent of sincerity. <div class="bookquote">``Exactly; that's the point. If my poor
girl should marry your brother, everything--as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happiness--would
depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being a good fellow. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is the best creature in the
world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could never do him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a grain of injury. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), on the other
hand, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should not be all that we desire, might make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very
miserable. That is why I want you to throw some light upon his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
character, you know. Of course you are not bound to do it. My daughter,
whom you have never seen, is nothing to you; and I, possibly, am only an
indiscreet and impertinent old man. It is perfectly open to you to tell
me that my visit is in very bad taste and that I had better go about my
business. But I don't think you will do this; because I think we shall
interest you, my poor girl and I. I am sure that if you were to see
Catherine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would interest you very much. I don't mean because she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is
interesting in the usual sense of the word, but because you would feel
sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is so soft, so simple-minded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would be such an
easy victim! A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) miserable; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have neither the intelligence nor the
resolution to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have an
exaggerated power of suffering. I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>added the Doctor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) most
insinuating, his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) most professional laugh, <div class="bookquote">``you are already interested!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been interested from the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says that--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) calls it an engagement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has told me you didn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tell you that I don't like _him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told me that too. I said I couldn't help it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>added Mrs.
Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can't. But what you can do is to tell me I am right--to
give me an attestation, as it were.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>And the Doctor accompanied this
remark with another professional smile.

<p/>Mrs. Montgomery, however, smiled not at all; it was obvious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
could not take the humorous view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) appeal. <div class="bookquote">``That is a good deal to
ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no doubt of that; and I must, in conscience, remind you of
the advantages a young man marrying my daughter would enjoy. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has an
income of ten thousand dollars in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own right, left her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother;
if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marries a husband I approve, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will come into almost twice as
much more at my death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid financial
statement; she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) had never heard thousands of dollars so familiarly talked
about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) flushed a little with excitement. <div class="bookquote">``Your daughter will be
immensely rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) said softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely--that's the bother of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if Morris should marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) hesitated timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would be master of all that money? By no means. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would be master
of the ten thousand a year that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother; but I should
leave every penny of my own fortune, earned in the laborious exercise of
my profession, to public institutions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) eyes at this, and sat for some time gazing at
the straw matting which covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it seems to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``that in so doing
I should play your brother a very shabby trick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. That is too much money to get possession of so easily, by
marrying. I don't think it would be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's right to get all one can. But in this case your brother wouldn't
be able. If Catherine marries without my consent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doesn't get a
penny from my own pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that certain?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Montgomery, looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As certain as that I sit here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should pine away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should pine to a shadow, which isn't probable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Morris know this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor exclaimed.

<p/>Mrs. Montgomery resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) meditations, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) visitor, who was
prepared to give time to the affair, asked himself whether, in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) little conscientious air, she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was not playing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) brother's
hands. At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was half ashamed of the ordeal to which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
had subjected her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>), and was touched by the gentleness with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) bore
it. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were a humbug,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would get angry; unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) be
very deep indeed. It is not probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is as deep as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What makes you dislike Morris so much?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) presently asked, emerging
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) reflexions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) in the least as a friend, as a companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) seems
to me a charming fellow, and I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would be excellent
company. I dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), exclusively, as a son-in-law. If the only
office of a son-in-law were to dine at the paternal table, I should set a
high value upon your brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dines capitally. But that is a small
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) function, which, in general, is to be a protector and
caretaker of my child, who is singularly ill-adapted to take care of
herself. It is there that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) doesn't satisfy me. I confess I have
nothing but my impression to go by; but I am in the habit of trusting my
impression. Of course you are at liberty to contradict it flat. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
strikes me as selfish and shallow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery's eyes expanded a little, and the Doctor fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) saw
the light of admiration in them. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder you have discovered he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is
selfish!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hides it so well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery. <div class="bookquote">``And I think we are all rather
selfish,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) added quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so too; but I have seen people hide it better than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). You see
I am helped by a habit I have of dividing people into classes, into
types. I may easily be mistaken about your brother as an individual, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) type is written on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) whole person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very good-looking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/>The Doctor eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``You women are all the same! But the type
to which your brother belongs was made to be the ruin of you, and you
were made to be its handmaids and victims. The sign of the type in
question is the determination--sometimes terrible in its quiet
intensity--to accept nothing of life but its pleasures, and to secure
these pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant sex. Young men of
this class never do anything for themselves that they can get other
people to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the devotion, the
superstition of others that keeps them going. These others in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred are women. What our young friends
chiefly insist upon is that some one else shall suffer for them; and
women do that sort of thing, as you must know, wonderfully well.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>The
Doctor paused a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) added abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``You have suffered
immensely for your brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This exclamation was abrupt, as I say, but it was also perfectly
calculated. The Doctor had been rather disappointed at not finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
compact and comfortable little hostess surrounded in a more visible
degree by the ravages of Morris Townsend's immorality; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had said to
himself that this was not because the young man had spared her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), but
because she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had contrived to plaster up her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) wounds. They were aching
there, behind the varnished stove, the festooned engravings, beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
own neat little poplin bosom; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only touch the tender spot,
she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) would make a movement that would betray her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>). The words I have just
quoted were an attempt to put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger suddenly upon the place; and
they had some of the success that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked for. The tears sprang for a
moment to Mrs. Montgomery's eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) indulged in a proud little jerk
of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know how you have found that out!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By a philosophic trick--by what they call induction. You know you have
always your option of contradicting me. But kindly answer me a question.
Don't you give your brother money? I think you ought to answer that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have not had much to give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``If you ask me for a confession of poverty,
that is easily made. I am very poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One would never suppose it from your--your charming house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I learned from my sister that your income was moderate, and
your family numerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have five children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Montgomery observed; <div class="bookquote">``but I am happy to say
I can bring them up decently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can--accomplished and devoted as you are! But your brother
has counted them over, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Counted them over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows there are five, I mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tells me it is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that brings them
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery stared a moment, and then quickly--<div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) teaches
them Spanish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor laughed out. <div class="bookquote">``That must take a great deal off your hands!
Your brother also knows, of course, that you have very little money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have often told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Montgomery exclaimed, more unreservedly
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) had yet spoken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) was apparently taking some comfort in the
Doctor's clairvoyancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which means that you have often occasion to, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) often sponges
on you. Excuse the crudity of my language; I simply express a fact. I
don't ask you how much of your money he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has had, it is none of my
business. I have ascertained what I suspected--what I wished.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>And the
Doctor got up, gently smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``Your brother lives on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
said as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stood there.

<p/>Mrs. Montgomery quickly rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) chair, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) visitor's
movements with a look of fascination. But then, with a certain
inconsequence--<div class="bookquote">``I have never complained of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't protest--you have not betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But I advise you not to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) any more money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see it is in my interest that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should marry a rich person?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``If, as you say, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lives on me, I can only wish to get rid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and to put obstacles in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) marrying is to increase my
own difficulties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish very much you would come to me with your difficulties,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, if I throw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back on your hands, the least I can
do is to help you to bear the burden. If you will allow me to say so,
then, I shall take the liberty of placing in your hands, for the present,
a certain fund for your brother's support.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery stared; she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) evidently thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was jesting; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
presently saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was not, and the complication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) feelings
became painful. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that I ought to be very much offended
with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have offered you money? That's a superstition,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the
Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``You must let me come and see you again, and we will talk about
these things. I suppose that some of your children are girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have two little girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Montgomery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, when they grow up, and begin to think of taking husbands, you will
see how anxious you will be about the moral character of these gentlemen.
Then you will understand this visit of mine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are not to believe that Morris's moral character is bad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) a little, with folded arms. ``There is something
I should greatly like--as a moral satisfaction. I should like to hear you
say--`He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is abominably selfish!'''

<p/>The words came out with the grave distinctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice, and they
seemed for an instant to create, to poor Mrs. Montgomery's troubled
vision, a material image. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) gazed at it an instant, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
turned away. <div class="bookquote">``You distress me, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is, after all,
my brother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talents, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talents--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On these last words her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) voice
quavered, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) knew it she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) had burst into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talents are first-rate!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``We must find a proper
field for them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) most respectfully of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) regret at
having so greatly discomposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's all for my poor Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
went on. <div class="bookquote">``You must know her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and you will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Montgomery</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Montgomery brushed away her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) tears, and blushed at having shed them.
<div class="bookquote">``I should like to know your daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) answered; and then, in an
instant--<div class="bookquote">``Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marry him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Sloper went away with the words gently humming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) ears--<div class="bookquote">``Don't let
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marry him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sloper/DR. SLOPER</b></font>)</div>They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) the moral satisfaction of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had
just spoken, and their value was the greater that they had evidently cost
a pang to poor little Mrs. Montgomery's family pride.




<p/>XV


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been puzzled by the way that Catherine carried herself; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
attitude at this sentimental crisis seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) unnaturally passive.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) again after that scene in the library, the day
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) interview with Morris; and a week had elapsed without making
any change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manner. There was nothing in it that appealed for
pity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was even a little disappointed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) not giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) an
opportunity to make up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) harshness by some manifestation of
liberality which should operate as a compensation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) thought a little
of offering to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a tour in Europe; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was determined to do
this only in case she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should seem mutely to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had an idea
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would display a talent for mute reproaches, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was surprised
at not finding himself exposed to these silent batteries. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said
nothing, either tacitly or explicitly, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was never very
talkative, there was now no especial eloquence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reserve. And poor
Catherine was not sulky--a style of behaviour for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had too little
histrionic talent; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was simply very patient. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
thinking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was apparently doing so in a
deliberate and unimpassioned manner, with a view of making the best of
it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will do as I have bidden her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made the
further reflexion that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter was not a woman of a great spirit. I
know not whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had hoped for a little more resistance for the sake
of a little more entertainment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had said
before, that though it might have its momentary alarms, paternity was,
after all, not an exciting vocation.

<p/>Catherine, meanwhile, had made a discovery of a very different sort; it
had become vivid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that there was a great excitement in trying to be
a good daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had an entirely new feeling, which may be described
as a state of expectant suspense about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own actions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) watched
herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have watched another person, and wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
would do. It was as if this other person, who was both herself and not
herself, had suddenly sprung into being, inspiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a natural
curiosity as to the performance of untested functions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad I have such a good daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
after the lapse of several days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am trying to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, turning away, with a conscience
not altogether clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is anything you would like to say to me, you know you must not
hesitate. You needn't feel obliged to be so quiet. I shouldn't care
that Mr. Townsend should be a frequent topic of conversation, but
whenever you have anything particular to say about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) I shall be very
glad to hear it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing particular at present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen Morris again, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was sure
that if this had been the case she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had, in fact, not
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had only written him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) a long letter. The letter at least
was long for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and, it may be added, that it was long for Morris; it
consisted of five pages, in a remarkably neat and handsome hand.
Catherine's handwriting was beautiful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was even a little proud of
it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was extremely fond of copying, and possessed volumes of extracts
which testified to this accomplishment; volumes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had exhibited
one day to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover, when the bliss of feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was important in
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eyes was exceptionally keen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told Morris in writing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father had expressed the wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should not see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) begged he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not come to the house until she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have <div class="bookquote">``made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Morris replied with a passionate epistle, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked
to what, in Heaven's name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind. Had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
mind been made up two weeks before, and could it be possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
entertained the idea of throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) off? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mean to break down at
the very beginning of their ordeal, after all the promises of fidelity
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had both given and extracted? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) gave an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own
interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father--an account not identical at all points with
that offered in these pages. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was terribly violent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris wrote;
<div class="bookquote">``but you know my self-control. I have need of it all when I remember
that I have it in my power to break in upon your cruel captivity.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Catherine sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), in answer to this, a note of three lines. <div class="bookquote">``I am in
great trouble; do not doubt of my affection, but let me wait a little and
think.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>The idea of a struggle with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, of setting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will
against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, was heavy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) soul, and it kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) formally
submissive, as a great physical weight keeps us motionless. It never
entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover off; but from the first she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
tried to assure herself that there would be a peaceful way out of their
difficulty. The assurance was vague, for it contained no element of
positive conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father would change his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only had
an idea that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should be very good, the situation would in some
mysterious manner improve. To be good, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must be patient, respectful,
abstain from judging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father too harshly, and from committing any act
of open defiance. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was perhaps right, after all, to think as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did;
by which Catherine meant not in the least that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) judgement of Morris's
motives in seeking to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was perhaps a just one, but that it was
probably natural and proper that conscientious parents should be
suspicious and even unjust. There were probably people in the world as
bad as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father supposed Morris to be, and if there were the slightest
chance of Morris being one of these sinister persons, the Doctor was
right in taking it into account. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
knew, how the purest love and truth were seated in the young man's eyes;
but Heaven, in its time, might appoint a way of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to such
knowledge. Catherine expected a good deal of Heaven, and referred to the
skies the initiative, as the French say, in dealing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dilemma.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not imagine herself imparting any kind of knowledge to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father, there was something superior even in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) injustice and absolute
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mistakes. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could at least be good, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were only
good enough, Heaven would invent some way of reconciling all things--the
dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's errors and the sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own confidence,
the strict performance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) filial duties and the enjoyment of Morris
Townsend's affection. Poor Catherine would have been glad to regard Mrs.
Penniman as an illuminating agent, a part which this lady herself indeed
was but imperfectly prepared to play. Mrs. Penniman took too much
satisfaction in the sentimental shadows of this little drama to have, for
the moment, any great interest in dissipating them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wished the plot
to thicken, and the advice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece tended, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own
imagination, to produce this result. It was rather incoherent counsel,
and from one day to another it contradicted itself; but it was pervaded
by an earnest desire that Catherine should do something striking. <div class="bookquote">``You
must _act_, my dear; in your situation the great thing is to act,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Penniman, who found her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece altogether beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) opportunities.
Mrs. Penniman's real hope was that the girl would make a secret marriage,
at which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should officiate as brideswoman or duenna. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a vision
of this ceremony being performed in some subterranean chapel--subterranean
chapels in New York were not frequent, but Mrs. Penniman's imagination
was not chilled by trifles--and of the guilty couple--she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) liked to think of
poor Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suitor as the guilty couple--being shuffled away in
a fast-whirling vehicle to some obscure lodging in the suburbs, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
would pay them -LRB-in a thick veil-RRB- clandestine visits, where they would
endure a period of romantic privation, and where ultimately, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
should have been their earthly providence, their intercessor, their
advocate, and their medium of communication with the world, they should
be reconciled to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother in an artistic tableau, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) herself
should be somehow the central figure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated as yet to recommend
this course to Catherine, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attempted to draw an attractive picture
of it to Morris Townsend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in daily communication with the young
man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept informed by letters of the state of affairs in
Washington Square. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been banished, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, from the house,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) no longer saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ended by writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) longed
for an interview. This interview could take place only on neutral
ground, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bethought herself greatly before selecting a place of
meeting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had an inclination for Greenwood Cemetery, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave it
up as too distant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not absent herself for so long, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said,
without exciting suspicion. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought of the Battery, but that
was rather cold and windy, besides one's being exposed to intrusion from
the Irish emigrants who at this point alight, with large appetites, in
the New World and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fixed upon an oyster saloon in the Seventh
Avenue, kept by a negro--an establishment of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew nothing save
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had noticed it in passing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made an appointment with Morris
Townsend to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to the tryst at dusk, enveloped
in an impenetrable veil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waiting for half an hour--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had
almost the whole width of the city to traverse--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked to wait, it
seemed to intensify the situation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ordered a cup of tea, which
proved excessively bad, and this gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was suffering
in a romantic cause. When Morris at last arrived, they sat together for
half an hour in the duskiest corner of a back shop; and it is hardly too
much to say that this was the happiest half-hour that Mrs. Penniman had
known for years. The situation was really thrilling, and it scarcely
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) a false note when her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) companion asked for an oyster stew,
and proceeded to consume it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes. Morris, indeed, needed all
the satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), for it may be
intimated to the reader that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) regarded Mrs. Penniman in the light of a
fifth wheel to his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) coach. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was in a state of irritation natural to a
gentleman of fine parts who had been snubbed in a benevolent attempt to
confer a distinction upon a young woman of inferior characteristics, and
the insinuating sympathy of this somewhat desiccated matron appeared to
offer him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) no practical relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) a humbug, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) judged of
humbugs with a good deal of confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had listened and made himself
agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) at first, in order to get a footing in Washington
Square; and at present he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) needed all his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) self-command to be decently
civil. It would have gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) was a fantastic
old woman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) should like to put her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) into an omnibus and send
her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) home. We know, however, that Morris possessed the virtue of
self-control, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had, moreover, the constant habit of seeking to be
agreeable; so that, although Mrs. Penniman's demeanour only exasperated
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) already unquiet nerves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) with a sombre deference in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) found much to admire.




<p/>XVI


<p/>THEY had of course immediately spoken of Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) send me a
message, or--or anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) appeared to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
might have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) a trinket or a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hair.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman was slightly embarrassed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had not told her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) intended expedition. <div class="bookquote">``Not exactly a message,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for one, because I was afraid to--to excite her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not very excitable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And Morris gave a smile of some
bitterness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is better than that. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is steadfast--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will hold fast, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the death!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I hope it won't come to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must be prepared for the worst, and that is what I wish to speak to
you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you call the worst?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, <div class="bookquote">``my brother's hard, intellectual nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the devil!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is impervious to pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman added, by way of explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) won't come round?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will never be vanquished by argument. I have studied him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will
be vanquished only by the accomplished fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The accomplished fact?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will come round afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with extreme
significance. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cares for nothing but facts; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) must be met by facts!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>rejoined Morris, <div class="bookquote">``it is a fact that I wish to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) daughter.
I met him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with that the other day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was not at all vanquished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman was silent a little, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) smile beneath the shadow of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) capacious bonnet, on the edge of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) black veil was arranged
curtain-wise, fixed itself upon Morris's face with a still more tender
brilliancy. <div class="bookquote">``Marry Catherine first and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) afterwards!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you recommend that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man, frowning heavily.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was a little frightened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) went on with considerable boldness.
<div class="bookquote">``That is the way I see it: a private marriage--a private marriage.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
repeated the phrase because she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) liked it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that I should carry Catherine off? What do they call
it--elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not a crime when you are driven to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``My
husband, as I have told you, was a distinguished clergyman; one of the
most eloquent men of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) day. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) once married a young couple that had
fled from the house of the young lady's father. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was so interested in
their story. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had no hesitation, and everything came out beautifully.
The father was afterwards reconciled, and thought everything of the young
man. Mr. Penniman married them in the evening, about seven o’clock. The
church was so dark, you could scarcely see; and Mr. Penniman was
intensely agitated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was so sympathetic. I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) could have
done it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately Catherine and I have not Mr. Penniman to marry us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said
Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but you have me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Penniman expressively. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
perform the ceremony, but I can help you. I can watch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The woman's an idiot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>thought Morris; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was obliged to say
something different. It was not, however, materially more civil. <div class="bookquote">``Was
it in order to tell me this that you requested I would meet you here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman had been conscious of a certain vagueness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) errand,
and of not being able to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) any very tangible reward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) long
walk. <div class="bookquote">``I thought perhaps you would like to see one who is so near to
Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) observed, with considerable majesty. <div class="bookquote">``And also,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``that you would value an opportunity of sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) empty hands with a melancholy smile. <div class="bookquote">``I am greatly
obliged to you, but I have nothing to send.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you a _word_?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) companion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) suggestive smile
coming back.

<p/>Morris frowned again. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to hold fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said rather curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good word--a noble word. It will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) happy for many days.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is very touching, very brave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman went on, arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
mantle and preparing to depart. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was so engaged she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had an
inspiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) found the phrase that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) could boldly offer as a
vindication of the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had taken. <div class="bookquote">``If you marry Catherine at all
risks''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you will give my brother a proof of your being what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
pretends to doubt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pretends to doubt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know what that is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman asked almost playfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not concern me to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris grandly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it makes you angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I despise it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you know what it is, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) finger
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pretends that you like--you like the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris hesitated a moment; and then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) spoke advisedly--<div class="bookquote">``I _do_
like the money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but not--but not as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) means it. You don't like it more than
Catherine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) elbows on the table and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``You
torture me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) murmured. And, indeed, this was almost the effect of the
poor lady's too importunate interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) situation.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted on making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) point. <div class="bookquote">``If you marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in spite of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will take for granted that you expect nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and are prepared
to do without it. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will see that you are disinterested.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head a little, following this argument, <div class="bookquote">``And what shall
I gain by that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will see that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has been wrong in thinking that you wished
to get his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And seeing that I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would go to the deuce with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will leave
it to a hospital. Is that what you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>asked Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't mean that; though that would be very grand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman
quickly added. <div class="bookquote">``I mean that having done you such an injustice, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will
think it his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) duty, at the end, to make some amends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head, though it must be confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was a little struck
with this idea. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is so sentimental?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not sentimental,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman; <div class="bookquote">``but, to be perfectly fair
to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I think he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has, in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own narrow way, a certain sense of duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>There passed through Morris Townsend's mind a rapid wonder as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
might, even under a remote contingency, be indebted to from the action of
this principle in Dr. Sloper's breast, and the inquiry exhausted itself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) sense of the ludicrous. <div class="bookquote">``Your brother has no duties to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
said presently, <div class="bookquote">``and I none to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has duties to Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you see that on that principle Catherine has duties to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman got up, with a melancholy sigh, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) very
unimaginative. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has always performed them faithfully; and now, do
you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has no duties to _you_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman always, even in
conversation, italicised her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) personal pronouns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would sound harsh to say so! I am so grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris
added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) you said that! And now, remember that if you need me, I
am there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman, who could think of nothing more to say,
nodded vaguely in the direction of Washington Square.

<p/>Morris looked some moments at the sanded floor of the shop; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) seemed to
be disposed to linger a moment. At last, looking up with a certain
abruptness, <div class="bookquote">``It is your belief that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) marries me he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
off?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman stared a little, and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I have explained to you
what I think would happen--that in the end it would be the best thing to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does, in the long run she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will get the
money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't depend upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but upon you. Venture to appear as
disinterested as you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman ingeniously. Morris
dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes on the sanded floor again, pondering this; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
pursued. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Penniman and I had nothing, and we were very happy.
Catherine, moreover, has her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's fortune, which, at the time my
sister-in-law married, was considered a very handsome one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't speak of that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris; and, indeed, it was quite
superfluous, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had contemplated the fact in all its lights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Austin married a wife with money--why shouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but your brother was a doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris objected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, all young men can't be doctors!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it an extremely loathsome profession,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, with
an air of intellectual independence. Then in a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) went on rather
inconsequently, <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose there is a will already made in
Catherine's favour?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so--even doctors must die; and perhaps a little in mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Penniman frankly added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you believe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would certainly change it--as regards Catherine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and then change it back again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but one can't depend on that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to _depend_ on it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman asked.

<p/>Morris blushed a little. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I am certainly afraid of being the cause
of an injury to Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you must not be afraid. Be afraid of nothing, and everything will
go well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Mrs. Penniman paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cup of tea, and Morris paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
oyster stew, and they went out together into the dimly-lighted wilderness
of the Seventh Avenue. The dusk had closed in completely and the street
lamps were separated by wide intervals of a pavement in which cavities
and fissures played a disproportionate part. An omnibus, emblazoned with
strange pictures, went tumbling over the dislocated cobble-stones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How will you go home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris asked, following this vehicle with an
interested eye. Mrs. Penniman had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) arm.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I think this manner would be pleasant,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) continued to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) feel the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) support.

<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) through the devious ways of the west side of the
town, and through the bustle of gathering nightfall in populous streets,
to the quiet precinct of Washington Square. They lingered a moment at
the foot of Dr. Sloper's white marble steps, above which a spotless white
door, adorned with a glittering silver plate, seemed to figure, for
Morris, the closed portal of happiness; and then Mrs. Penniman's
companion rested a melancholy eye upon a lighted window in the upper part
of the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my room--my dear little room!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman remarked.

<p/>Morris started. <div class="bookquote">``Then I needn't come walking round the Square to gaze at
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's as you please. But Catherine's is behind; two noble windows on
the second floor. I think you can see them from the other street.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to see them, ma’am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And Morris turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) back to the
house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) you have been _here_, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman,
pointing to the spot where they stood; <div class="bookquote">``and I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) your
message--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is to hold fast!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes! of course. You know I write her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to say more when it is spoken! And remember, if you need me,
that I am _there_'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>; and Mrs. Penniman glanced at the third floor.

<p/>On this they separated, and Morris, left to himself, stood looking at the
house a moment; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) turned away, and took a gloomy walk round
the Square, on the opposite side, close to the wooden fence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
came back, and paused for a minute in front of Dr. Sloper's dwelling.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes travelled over it; they even rested on the ruddy windows of Mrs.
Penniman's apartment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thought it a devilish comfortable house.




<p/>XVII


<p/>MRS. PENNIMAN told Catherine that evening--the two ladies were sitting in
the back parlour--that she (<font color='blue'><b>PENNIMAN</b></font>) had had an interview with Morris Townsend; and
on receiving this news the girl started with a sense of pain. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt
angry for the moment; it was almost the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever felt
angry. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt was meddlesome; and from this came
a vague apprehension that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would spoil something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why you should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I don't think it was right,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--it seemed to me some one ought to see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one but I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, who felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were making the most
presumptuous speech of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life, and yet at the same time had an instinct
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was right in doing so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you wouldn't, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Lavinia rejoined; <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't know
what might have become of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Aunt Lavinia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), because my father has forbidden it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said
very simply.

<p/>There was a simplicity in this, indeed, which fairly vexed Mrs. Penniman.
<div class="bookquote">``If your father forbade you to go to sleep, I suppose you would keep
awake!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) commented.

<p/>Catherine looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you. You seem to be very
strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, you will understand me some day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman, who
was reading the evening paper, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) perused daily from the first
line to the last, resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) occupation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wrapped herself in
silence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was determined Catherine should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for an account of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) interview with Morris. But Catherine was silent for so long, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) almost lost patience; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was on the point of remarking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very heartless, when the girl at last spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is ready to marry you any day, in spite of everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine made no answer to this, and Mrs. Penniman almost lost patience
again; owing to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) at last volunteered the information that Morris
looked very handsome, but terribly haggard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seem sad?''  (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was dark under the eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``So different from
when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); though I am not sure that if I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in this
condition the first time, I should not have been even more struck with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). There is something brilliant in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) very misery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was, to Catherine's sense, a vivid picture, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
disapproved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt herself gazing at it. <div class="bookquote">``Where did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
asked presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In--in the Bowery; at a confectioner's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, who had a
general idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) ought to dissemble a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whereabouts is the place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine inquired, after another pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to go there, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>And Catherine got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seat and went to the fire, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood looking a while at the glowing coals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why are you so dry, Catherine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So dry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So cold--so irresponsive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl turned very quickly. <div class="bookquote">``Did _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feared only one thing--that you would be afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Afraid of your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine turned back to the fire again, and then, after a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said--<div class="bookquote">``I _am_ afraid of my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman got quickly up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) chair and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine for some time never moved; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes on the coals. At
last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you push me
so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't push you. When have I spoken to you before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that you have spoken to me several times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is necessary, then, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with
a good deal of solemnity. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you don't feel the importance--''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) paused a little; Catherine was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The importance of
not disappointing that gallant young heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman went back
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) chair, by the lamp, and, with a little jerk, picked up the evening
paper again.

<p/>Catherine stood there before the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, to whom it seemed that the girl had never had just this dark
fixedness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gaze. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you understand--or that you know
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't, it is not wonderful; you trust me so little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine made no attempt to deny this charge, and for some time more
nothing was said. But Mrs. Penniman's imagination was restless, and the
evening paper failed on this occasion to enchain it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you succumb to the dread of your father's wrath,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know what will become of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ tell you to say these things to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me to use my influence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trusts me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may never repent of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman gave a little
sharp slap to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) newspaper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) knew not what to make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece, who
had suddenly become stern and contradictious.

<p/>This tendency on Catherine's part was presently even more apparent. <div class="bookquote">``You
had much better not make any more appointments with Mr. Townsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman rose with considerable majesty. <div class="bookquote">``My poor child, are you
jealous of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Aunt Lavinia!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>murmured Catherine, blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is your place to teach me what is right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>On this point Catherine made no concession. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be right to
deceive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly have not deceived _you_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I promised my father--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt you promised your father. But I have promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had to admit this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did so in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe
Mr. Townsend himself likes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't like meeting me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not in secret; the place was full of people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was a secret place--away off in the Bowery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman flinched a little. <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen enjoy such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
remarked presently. <div class="bookquote">``I know what gentlemen like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father wouldn't like it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, do you propose to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Aunt Lavinia. But please don't do it again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I do it again, you will inform him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): is that what you mean? I do not
share your dread of my brother; I have always known how to defend my own
position. But I shall certainly never again take any step on your
behalf; you are much too thankless. I knew you were not a spontaneous
nature, but I believed you were firm, and I told your father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would find you so. I am disappointed--but your father will not be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And
with this, Mrs. Penniman offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece a brief good-night, and
withdrew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own apartment.




<p/>XVIII


<p/>CATHERINE sat alone by the parlour fire--sat there for more than an hour,
lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) meditations. Her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) aunt seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>CATHERINE</b></font>) aggressive and foolish,
and to see it so clearly--to judge Mrs. Penniman so positively--made her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
feel old and grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) did not resent the imputation of weakness; it
made no impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had not the sense of weakness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
was not hurt at not being appreciated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had an immense respect for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt that to displease him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be a misdemeanour
analogous to an act of profanity in a great temple; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) purpose had
slowly ripened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) prayers had purified it of its
violence. The evening advanced, and the lamp burned dim without her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
noticing it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) terrible plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
father was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) study--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been there all the evening; from time
to time she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) expected to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would perhaps
come, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sometimes came, into the parlour. At last the clock struck
eleven, and the house was wrapped in silence; the servants had gone to
bed. Catherine got up and went slowly to the door of the library, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waited a moment, motionless. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knocked, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waited
again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not the courage to turn
the latch. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt was true enough--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was afraid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and in saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no sense of weakness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meant that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not afraid of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) move within, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came
and opened the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``You are standing there like a
ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went into the room, but it was some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) contrived to say
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had come to say. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dressing-gown and
slippers, had been busy at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) writing-table, and after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
for some moments, and waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went and seated
himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) papers again. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back was turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to
hear the scratching of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained near the door, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
heart thumping beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bodice; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very glad that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back
was turned, for it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could more easily address
herself to this portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) person than to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
began, watching it while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You told me that if I should have anything more to say about Mr.
Townsend you would be glad to listen to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, not turning round, but stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
pen.

<p/>Catherine wished it would go on, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) herself continued. <div class="bookquote">``I thought I
would tell you that I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) again, but that I should like to
do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) good-bye?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>asked the Doctor.

<p/>The girl hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is not going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor wheeled slowly round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chair, with a smile that seemed to
accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of an epigram; but extremes meet, and Catherine had not
intended one. <div class="bookquote">``It is not to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) good-bye, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father, not that; at least, not for ever. I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
again, but I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine repeated.

<p/>The Doctor slowly rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) under lip with the feather of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) quill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you written to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, four times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), then. Once would have done that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I have asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to break
out into wrath; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes were so fine and cold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a dear, faithful child,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``Come here to your
father.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) got up, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>The words were a surprise, and they gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) an exquisite joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tenderly, soothingly; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). After this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to make me very happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to--but I am afraid I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can if you will. It all depends on your will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still, with the same tenderness, looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face
and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) averted eyes. There was a long silence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would release her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are happier than I, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt you are unhappy just now. But it is better to be
unhappy for three months and get over it, than for many years and never
get over it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if that were so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be so; I am sure of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went
on. <div class="bookquote">``Have you no faith in my wisdom, in my tenderness, in my solicitude
for your future?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you suppose that I know something of men: their vices, their
follies, their falsities?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) detached herself, and turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not vicious--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not
false!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father kept looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sharp, pure eye. <div class="bookquote">``You make
nothing of my judgement, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't ask you to believe it, but to take it on trust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was far from saying to herself that this was an ingenious
sophism; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) met the appeal none the less squarely. <div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
done--what do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has never done anything--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a selfish idler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, don't abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed pleadingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); it would be a great mistake. You may do as
you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added, turning away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you forgive me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By no means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will only be for once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by once. You must either give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up or
continue the acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to explain--to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To wait for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till you know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) better--till you consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) any such nonsense as that. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) well enough, and I
shall never consent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we can wait a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said poor Catherine, in a tone which was
meant to express the humblest conciliation, but which had upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father's nerves the effect of an iteration not characterised by tact.

<p/>The Doctor answered, however, quietly enough: <div class="bookquote">``Of course you can wait
till I die, if you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>Catherine gave a cry of natural horror.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your engagement will have one delightful effect upon you; it will make
you extremely impatient for that event.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine stood staring, and the Doctor enjoyed the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had made.
It came to Catherine with the force--or rather with the vague
impressiveness--of a logical axiom which it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) province to
controvert; and yet, though it was a scientific truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt wholly
unable to accept it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not marry, if that were true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a proof of it, then; for it is beyond a question that by
engaging yourself to Morris Townsend you simply wait for my death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away, feeling sick and faint; and the Doctor went on. <div class="bookquote">``And if
you wait for it with impatience, judge, if you please, what _his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)_
eagerness will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine turned it over--her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's words had such an authority for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very thoughts were capable of obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). There was a dreadful
ugliness in it, which seemed to glare at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) through the interposing
medium of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own feebler reason. Suddenly, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had an
inspiration--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) almost knew it to be an inspiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I don't marry before your death, I will not after,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, it must be admitted, this seemed only another epigram; and
as obstinacy, in unaccomplished minds, does not usually select such a
mode of expression, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the more surprised at this wanton play of a
fixed idea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that for an impertinence?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inquired; an inquiry of which,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite perceived the grossness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An impertinence? Oh, father, what terrible things you say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't wait for my death, you might as well marry immediately;
there is nothing else to wait for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>For some time Catherine made no answer; but finally she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Morris--little by little--might persuade you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never let him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) speak to me again. I dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine gave a long, low sigh; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tried to stifle it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had made
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind that it was wrong to make a parade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trouble, and to
endeavour to act upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father by the meretricious aid of emotion.
Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even thought it wrong--in the sense of being inconsiderate--to
attempt to act upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feelings at all; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) part was to effect some
gentle, gradual change in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intellectual perception of poor Morris's
character. But the means of effecting such a change were at present
shrouded in mystery, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt miserably helpless and hopeless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had exhausted all arguments, all replies. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father might have pitied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is one thing you can tell Mr. Townsend when you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
said: <div class="bookquote">``that if you marry without my consent, I don't leave you a farthing
of money. That will interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) more than anything else you can tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be very right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered. <div class="bookquote">``I ought not in that
case to have a farthing of your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor observed, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``your simplicity is
touching. Make that remark, in that tone, and with that expression of
countenance, to Mr. Townsend, and take a note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) answer. It won't be
polite--it will, express irritation; and I shall be glad of that, as it
will put me in the right; unless, indeed--which is perfectly possible--you
should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) the better for being rude to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will never be rude to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) what I say, all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quiet eyes filled with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) timid voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly as you choose!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to the door and opened it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
to go out. The movement gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a terrible sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be only once, for the present,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, lingering a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly as you choose,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) repeated, standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand on the
door. <div class="bookquote">``I have told you what I think. If you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), you will be an
ungrateful, cruel child; you will have given your old father the greatest
pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>This was more than the poor girl could bear; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tears overflowed, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) moved towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grimly consistent parent with a pitiful cry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hands were raised in supplication, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sternly evaded this appeal.
Instead of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sob out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) misery on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) simply took
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the arm and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) course across the threshold, closing the
door gently but firmly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). After he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) remained
listening. For a long time there was no sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
standing outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as I have said; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was right. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) move away, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) footstep
creaked faintly upon the stairs.

<p/>The Doctor took several turns round his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) study, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
pockets, and a thin sparkle, possibly of irritation, but partly also of
something like humour, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``By Jove,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will stick--I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will stick!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And this idea of
Catherine <div class="bookquote">``sticking''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>appeared to have a comical side, and to offer a
prospect of entertainment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) determined, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said to himself, to see
it out.




<p/>XIX


<p/>IT was for reasons connected with this determination that on the morrow
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sought a few words of private conversation with Mrs. Penniman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
sent for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) to the library, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) there informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hoped very
much that, as regarded this affair of Catherine's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
_p's_ and _q's_.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by such an expression,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister.
<div class="bookquote">``You speak as if I were learning the alphabet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The alphabet of common sense is something you will never learn,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the
Doctor permitted himself to respond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you called me here to insult me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. Simply to advise you. You have taken up young Townsend;
that's your own affair. I have nothing to do with your sentiments, your
fancies, your affections, your delusions; but what I request of you is
that you will keep these things to yourself. I have explained my views
to Catherine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) understands them perfectly, and anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does
further in the way of encouraging Mr. Townsend's attentions will be in
deliberate opposition to my wishes. Anything that you should do in the
way of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aid and comfort will be--permit me the
expression--distinctly treasonable. You know high treason is a capital
offence; take care how you incur the penalty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head, with a certain expansion of the eye
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) occasionally practised. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that you talk like a
great autocrat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I talk like my daughter's father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not like your sister's brother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Aunt Lavinia</b></font>)</div>cried Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said
the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes wonder whether I am your brother. We are so
extremely different. In spite of differences, however, we can, at a
pinch, understand each other; and that is the essential thing just now.
Walk straight with regard to Mr. Townsend; that's all I ask. It is
highly probable you have been corresponding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) for the last three
weeks--perhaps even seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). I don't ask you--you needn't tell me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
had a moral conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would contrive to tell a fib about the
matter, which it would disgust him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to listen to. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you have
done, stop doing it. That's all I wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you wish also by chance to murder our child?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I wish to make her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) live and be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will kill her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) passed a dreadful night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't die of one dreadful night, nor of a dozen. Remember that I am
a distinguished physician.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a moment. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) risked her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) retort. <div class="bookquote">``Your
being a distinguished physician has not prevented you from already losing
_two members_ of your family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had risked it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) such a terribly incisive
look--a look so like a surgeon's lancet--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was frightened at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
courage. And he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) in words that corresponded to the look: <div class="bookquote">``It
may not prevent me, either, from losing the society of still another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman took herself off, with whatever air of depreciated merit
was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) command, and repaired to Catherine's room, where the poor girl
was closeted. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew all about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dreadful night, for the two had met
again, the evening before, after Catherine left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father. Mrs.
Penniman was on the landing of the second floor when her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece came
upstairs. It was not remarkable that a person of so much subtlety should
have discovered that Catherine had been shut up with the Doctor. It was
still less remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have felt an extreme curiosity to
learn the result of this interview, and that this sentiment, combined
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) great amiability and generosity, should have prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
regret the sharp words lately exchanged between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece and herself.
As the unhappy girl came into sight, in the dusky corridor, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made a
lively demonstration of sympathy. Catherine's bursting heart was equally
oblivious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arms.
Mrs. Penniman drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) into Catherine's own room, and the two women sat
there together, far into the small hours; the younger one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head
on the other's lap, sobbing and sobbing at first in a soundless, stifled
manner, and then at last perfectly still. It gratified Mrs. Penniman to
be able to feel conscientiously that this scene virtually removed the
interdict which Catherine had placed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) further communion with
Morris Townsend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not gratified, however, when, in coming back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece's room before breakfast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found that Catherine had risen and
was preparing herself for this meal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not go to breakfast,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you are not well enough,
after your fearful night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am very well, and I am only afraid of being late.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't understand you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman cried. <div class="bookquote">``You should stay in bed
for three days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I could never do that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, to whom this idea presented
no attractions.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman was in despair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) noted, with extreme annoyance, that
the trace of the night's tears had completely vanished from Catherine's
eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a most impracticable _physique_. <div class="bookquote">``What effect do you
expect to have upon your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt demanded, <div class="bookquote">``if you come
plumping down, without a vestige of any sort of feeling, as if nothing in
the world had happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not like me to lie in bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the more reason for your doing it. How else do you expect to move
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine thought a little. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how; but not in that way. I
wish to be just as usual.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) finished dressing, and, according to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt's expression, went plumping down into the paternal presence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was really too modest for consistent pathos.

<p/>And yet it was perfectly true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had had a dreadful night. Even
after Mrs. Penniman left her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had had no sleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lay staring at
the uncomforting gloom, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes and ears filled with the movement
with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) room, and of the words in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was a heartless daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) heart was
breaking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had heart enough for that. At moments it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and that to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was doing, a girl must
indeed be bad. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) _was_ bad; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) couldn't help it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would try
to appear good, even if her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart were perverted; and from time to time
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might accomplish something by ingenious
concessions to form, though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should persist in caring for Morris.
Catherine's ingenuities were indefinite, and we are not called upon to
expose their hollowness. The best of them perhaps showed itself in that
freshness of aspect which was so discouraging to Mrs. Penniman, who was
amazed at the absence of haggardness in a young woman who for a whole
night had lain quivering beneath a father's curse. Poor Catherine was
conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) freshness; it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a feeling about the future which
rather added to the weight upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind. It seemed a proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
strong and solid and dense, and would live to a great age--longer than
might be generally convenient; and this idea was depressing, for it
appeared to saddle her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a pretension the more, just when the
cultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doing right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
wrote that day to Morris Townsend, requesting him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on
the morrow; using very few words, and explaining nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
explain everything face to face.




<p/>XX


<p/>ON the morrow, in the afternoon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) voice at the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
step in the hall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) in the big, bright front parlour, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) instructed the servant that if any one should call she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
particularly engaged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's coming in, for
at that hour he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always driving about town. When Morris stood there
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), the first thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was conscious of was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was
even more beautiful to look at than fond recollection had painted him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>);
the next was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) arms. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was free
again it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had now indeed thrown herself into the
gulf of defiance, and even, for an instant, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been married to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been very cruel, and had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) very unhappy;
and Catherine felt acutely the difficulty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) destiny, which forced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to give pain in such opposite quarters. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished that, instead
of reproaches, however tender, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) help; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was certainly
wise enough, and clever enough, to invent some issue from their troubles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expressed this belief, and Morris received the assurance as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
thought it natural; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) interrogated, at first--as was natural
too--rather than committed himself to marking out a course.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have made me wait so long,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how I
have been living; every hour seemed like years. You should have decided
sooner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decided?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decided whether you would keep me or give me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, with a long tender murmur, <div class="bookquote">``I never thought of
giving you up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, then, were you waiting for?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The young man was ardently logical.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought my father might--might--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might see how unhappy you were?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! But that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might look at it differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now you have sent for me to tell me that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does so. Is
that it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>This hypothetical optimism gave the poor girl a pang. <div class="bookquote">``No, Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
said solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) looks at it still in the same way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why have you sent for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I wanted to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine piteously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's an excellent reason, surely. But did you want to look at me
only? Have you nothing to tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beautiful persuasive eyes were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered
what answer would be noble enough to make to such a gaze as that. For a
moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own eyes took it in, and then--<div class="bookquote">``I _did_ want to look at you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said gently. But after this speech, most inconsistently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
face.

<p/>Morris watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a moment, attentively. <div class="bookquote">``Will you marry me
to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Next week, then. Any time within a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it better to wait?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To wait for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly knew for what; but this tremendous leap alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Till we
have thought about it a little more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head, sadly and reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had been
thinking about it these three weeks. Do you want to turn it over in your
mind for five years? You have given me more than time enough. My poor
girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``you are not sincere!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine coloured from brow to chin, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes filled with tears.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, how can you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you must take me or leave me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, very reasonably. <div class="bookquote">``You
can't please your father and me both; you must choose between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have chosen you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said passionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then marry me next week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any other way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``None that I know of for arriving at the same result. If there is, I
should be happy to hear of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine could think of nothing of the kind, and Morris's luminosity
seemed almost pitiless. The only thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could think of was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father might, after all, come round, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) articulated, with an awkward
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might
happen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it is in the least degree likely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could only know you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can know me if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will. What is to prevent it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ideas, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``They are so--so terribly
strong.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trembled with the recollection of them yet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather you should think them weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing about my father is weak!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl.

<p/>Morris turned away, walking to the window, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stood looking out.
<div class="bookquote">``You are terribly afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) remarked at last.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt no impulse to deny it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had no shame in it; for if it
was no honour to herself, at least it was an honour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I
must be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't love me--not as I love you. If you fear your father more
than you love me, then your love is not what I hoped it was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my friend!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do _I_ fear anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) demanded, turning round on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``For your
sake what am I not ready to face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are noble--you are brave!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, stopping short at a distance
that was almost respectful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Small good it does me, if you are so timid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think that I am--_really_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by `really.' It is really enough to make us
miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be strong enough to wait--to wait a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And suppose after a long time your father should hate me worse than
ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be touched by my fidelity? Is that what you mean? If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is so
easily touched, then why should you be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was much to the point, and Catherine was struck by it. <div class="bookquote">``I will try
not to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood there submissively, the image, in
advance, of a dutiful and responsible wife. This image could not fail to
recommend itself to Morris Townsend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) continued to give proof of
the high estimation in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). It could only have been at the
prompting of such a sentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) presently mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that the
course recommended by Mrs. Penniman was an immediate union, regardless of
consequences.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Aunt Penniman would like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said simply--and yet with
a certain shrewdness. It must, however, have been in pure simplicity,
and from motives quite untouched by sarcasm, that, a few moments after,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on to say to Morris that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a message for
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It was quite on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conscience to deliver this message, and had the
mission been ten times more painful she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have as scrupulously
performed it. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me to tell you--to tell you very distinctly, and
directly from himself, that if I marry without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consent, I shall not
inherit a penny of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made a great point of this. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
seemed to think--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to think--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris flushed, as any young man of spirit might have flushed at an
imputation of baseness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seem to think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it would make a difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _will_ make a difference--in many things. We shall be by many
thousands of dollars the poorer; and that is a great difference. But it
will make none in my affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not want the money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``for you know I have a
good deal myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear girl, I know you have something. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't touch that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``My mother left it to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris was silent a while. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very positive about this, was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
asked at last. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought such a message would annoy me terribly, and
make me throw off the mask, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine wearily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that I care for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) message as much as for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And
Morris snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) fingers sonorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know you sometimes disappoint me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I might. I disappoint every one--father and Aunt
Penniman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it doesn't matter with me, because I am fonder of you than they
are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl swimming</b></font>)</div>said the girl, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) imagination--what there was of
it--swimming in this happy truth, which seemed, after all, invidious to no
one.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it your belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will stick to it--stick to it for ever, to this
idea of disinheriting you?--that your goodness and patience will never
wear out his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) cruelty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The trouble is that if I marry you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will think I am not good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
will think that a proof.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) will never forgive you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>This idea, sharply expressed by Morris's handsome lips, renewed for a
moment, to the poor girl's temporarily pacified conscience, all its
dreadful vividness. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you must love me very much!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no doubt of that, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lover rejoined. ``You don't
like that word `disinherited,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It isn't the money; it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should feel so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it seems to you a kind of curse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``It must be
very dismal. But don't you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) went on presently, <div class="bookquote">``that if you
were to try to be very clever, and to set rightly about it, you might in
the end conjure it away? Don't you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) continued further, in a
tone of sympathetic speculation, <div class="bookquote">``that a really clever woman, in your
place, might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) round at last? Don't you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, suddenly, Morris was interrupted; these ingenious inquiries had not
reached Catherine's ears. The terrible word <div class="bookquote">``disinheritance,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with all
its impressive moral reprobation, was still ringing there; seemed indeed
to gather force as it lingered. The mortal chill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation struck
more deeply into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) child-like heart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was overwhelmed by a
feeling of loneliness and danger. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) refuge was there, close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands to grasp it. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, with
a shudder, <div class="bookquote">``I will marry you as soon as you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) surrendered
herself, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear good girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) exclaimed, looking down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) prize. And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) looked up again, rather vaguely, with parted lips and lifted eyebrows.




<p/>XXI


<p/>DR. SLOPER very soon imparted his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) conviction to Mrs. Almond, in the same
terms in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had announced it to himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s going to stick, by
Jove! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s going to stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is not going to break down. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is going to
drag out the engagement, in the hope of making me relent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And shall you not relent?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall a geometrical proposition relent? I am not so superficial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't geometry treat of surfaces?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Almond, who, as we know,
was clever, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but it treats of them profoundly. Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) young man are
my surfaces; I have taken their measure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak as if it surprised you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is immense; there will be a great deal to observe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are shockingly cold-blooded!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need to be with all this hot blood about me. Young Townsend indeed is
cool; I must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) that merit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond answered; <div class="bookquote">``but I am not at all surprised
at Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess I am a little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must have been so deucedly divided and
bothered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say it amuses you outright! I don't see why it should be such a joke
that your daughter adores you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the point where the adoration stops that I find it interesting to
fix.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It stops where the other sentiment begins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all--that would be simple enough. The two things are extremely
mixed up, and the mixture is extremely odd. It will produce some third
element, and that's what I am waiting to see. I wait with suspense--with
positive excitement; and that is a sort of emotion that I didn't suppose
Catherine would ever provide for me. I am really very much obliged to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will cling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will certainly cling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; as I say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cling is prettier. That's what those very simple natures always do, and
nothing could be simpler than Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doesn't take many
impressions; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) takes one she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) keeps it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is like a copper
kettle that receives a dent; you may polish up the kettle, but you can't
efface the mark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must try and polish up Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
to Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) won't forget him (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) in Europe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) will forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Almond looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``Should you really like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Extremely!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman, meanwhile, lost little time in putting herself again in
communication with Morris Townsend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to favour her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) with
another interview, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) did not on this occasion select an oyster
saloon as the scene of their meeting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) proposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) should join
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) at the door of a certain church, after service on Sunday afternoon,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was careful not to appoint the place of worship which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) usually
visited, and where, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said, the congregation would have spied upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) picked out a less elegant resort, and on issuing from its
portal at the hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had fixed she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) saw the young man standing apart.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no recognition till she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had crossed the street and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) to some distance. Here, with a smile--<div class="bookquote">``Excuse my apparent
want of cordiality,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You know what to believe about that.
Prudence before everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) in what direction
they should walk, <div class="bookquote">``Where we shall be least observed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>Morris was not in high good-humour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) response to this speech was
not particularly gallant. <div class="bookquote">``I don't flatter myself we shall be much
observed anywhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) turned recklessly toward the centre of the
town. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have come to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>dent</b></font>) has knocked under,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I am not altogether a harbinger of good; and yet, too, I am
to a certain extent a messenger of peace. I have been thinking a great
deal, Mr. Townsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I do; but I can't help it, my mind is so terribly active.
When I give myself, I give myself. I pay the penalty in my headaches, my
famous headaches--a perfect circlet of pain! But I carry it as a queen
carries her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) crown. Would you believe that I have one now? I wouldn't,
however, have missed our rendezvous for anything. I have something very
important to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, let's have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was perhaps a little headlong the other day in advising you to marry
immediately. I have been thinking it over, and now I see it just a
little differently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to have a great many different ways of seeing the same object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Their number is infinite!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, in a tone which seemed to
suggest that this convenient faculty was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brightest attributes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recommend you to take one way and stick to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but it isn't easy to choose. My imagination is never quiet, never
satisfied. It makes me a bad adviser, perhaps; but it makes me a capital
friend!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A capital friend who gives bad advice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not intentionally--and who hurries off, at every risk, to make the most
humble excuses!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, what do you advise me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be very patient; to watch and wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that bad advice or good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not for me to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman rejoined, with some dignity.
<div class="bookquote">``I only pretend it's sincere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will you come to me next week and recommend something different and
equally sincere?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may come to you next week and tell you that I am in the streets!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the streets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had a terrible scene with my brother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) threatens, if
anything happens, to turn me out of the house. You know I am a poor
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris had a speculative idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had a little property; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
naturally did not press this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very sorry to see you suffer martyrdom for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``But you make your brother out a regular Turk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly do not regard Austin as a satisfactory Christian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And am I to wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is converted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait, at any rate, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) is less violent. Bide your time, Mr.
Townsend; remember the prize is great!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris walked along some time in silence, tapping the railings and
gateposts very sharply with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly are devilish inconsistent!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) broke out at last. <div class="bookquote">``I have
already got Catherine to consent to a private marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman was indeed inconsistent, for at this news she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) gave a little
jump of gratification.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! when and where?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cried. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) stopped short.

<p/>Morris was a little vague about this.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That isn't fixed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consents. It's deuced awkward, now, to back
out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman, as I say, had stopped short; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) stood there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
eyes fixed brilliantly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Townsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) proceeded, <div class="bookquote">``shall I tell you something? Catherine
loves you so much that you may do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This declaration was slightly ambiguous, and Morris opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am happy to hear it! But what do you mean by `anything'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may postpone--you may change about; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) won't think the worse of
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris stood there still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) raised eyebrows; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said simply
and rather dryly--<div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) remarked to Mrs. Penniman that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) walked so slowly she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would attract notice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) succeeded, after a
fashion, in hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) back to the domicile of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) tenure had
become so insecure.




<p/>XXII


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had slightly misrepresented the matter in saying that Catherine had
consented to take the great step. We left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) just now declaring that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would burn her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ships behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but Morris, after having elicited
this declaration, had become conscious of good reasons for not taking it
up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) avoided, gracefully enough, fixing a day, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
under the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eye on one. Catherine may have had
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) difficulties; but those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) circumspect suitor are also worthy of
consideration. The prize was certainly great; but it was only to be won
by striking the happy mean between precipitancy and caution. It would be
all very well to take one's jump and trust to Providence; Providence was
more especially on the side of clever people, and clever people were
known by an indisposition to risk their bones. The ultimate reward of a
union with a young woman who was both unattractive and impoverished ought
to be connected with immediate disadvantages by some very palpable chain.
Between the fear of losing Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) possible fortune altogether,
and the fear of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too soon and finding this possible fortune as
void of actuality as a collection of emptied bottles, it was not
comfortable for Morris Townsend to choose; a fact that should be
remembered by readers disposed to judge harshly of a young man who may
have struck them as making but an indifferently successful use of fine
natural parts. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not forgotten that in any event Catherine had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own ten thousand a year; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had devoted an abundance of meditation to
this circumstance. But with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fine parts he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rated himself high, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had a perfectly definite appreciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) value, which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
inadequately represented by the sum I have mentioned. At the same time
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reminded himself that this sum was considerable, that everything is
relative, and that if a modest income is less desirable than a large one,
the complete absence of revenue is nowhere accounted an advantage. These
reflexions gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plenty of occupation, and made it necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should trim his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sail. Dr. Sloper's opposition was the unknown quantity
in the problem he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to work out. The natural way to work it out was by
marrying Catherine; but in mathematics there are many short cuts, and
Morris was not without a hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should yet discover one. When
Catherine took him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) word and consented to renounce the attempt to
mollify her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) drew back skilfully enough, as I have said, and
kept the wedding-day still an open question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sincerity
was so complete that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was incapable of suspecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was playing
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trouble just now was of another kind. The poor girl had an
admirable sense of honour; and from the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had brought herself to
the point of violating her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's wish, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
no right to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) protection. It was on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conscience that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
ought to live under his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) roof only so long as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conformed to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wisdom.
There was a great deal of glory in such a position, but poor Catherine
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had forfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) claim to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lot with a
young man against whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had solemnly warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and broken the
contract under which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) provided her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a happy home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not
give up the young man, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must leave the home; and the sooner the
object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preference offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) another the sooner her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation
would lose its awkward twist. This was close reasoning; but it was
commingled with an infinite amount of merely instinctive penitence.
Catherine's days at this time were dismal, and the weight of some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hours was almost more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could bear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father never looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), never spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew perfectly what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was about, and this
was part of a plan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
afraid of seeming to offer herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) observation-RRB-, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pitied
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for the sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had brought upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head and
busied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands, and went about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daily occupations; and when the
state of things in Washington Square seemed intolerable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes and indulged herself with an intellectual vision of the man for
whose sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had broken a sacred law. Mrs. Penniman, of the three
persons in Washington Square, had much the most of the manner that
belongs to a great crisis. If Catherine was quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was quietly
quiet, as I may say, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pathetic effects, which there was no one to
notice, were entirely unstudied and unintended. If the Doctor was stiff
and dry and absolutely indifferent to the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) companions, it
was so lightly, neatly, easily done, that you would have had to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
well to discover that, on the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) rather enjoyed having to be so
disagreeable. But Mrs. Penniman was elaborately reserved and
significantly silent; there was a richer rustle in the very deliberate
movements to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) confined herself, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) occasionally spoke,
in connexion with some very trivial event, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had the air of meaning
something deeper than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said. Between Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father
nothing had passed since the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
study. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had something to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ought to say
it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept it back, for fear of irritating him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) also had
something to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was determined not to speak first. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was interested, as we know, in seeing how, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were left to herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``stick.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen Morris Townsend
again, and that their relations remained quite the same.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we shall marry--before very long. And probably, meanwhile, I
shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) rather often; about once a week, not more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coldly from head to foot, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been a
stranger. It was the first time his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes had rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a week,
which was fortunate, if that was to be their expression. <div class="bookquote">``Why not three
times a day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``What prevents your meeting as often as you
choose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away a moment; there were tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``It is better once a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see how it is better. It is as bad as it can be. If you
flatter yourself that I care for little modifications of that sort, you
are very much mistaken. It is as wrong of you to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) once a week as
it would be to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) all day long. Not that it matters to me,
however.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine tried to follow these words, but they seemed to lead towards a
vague horror from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recoiled. <div class="bookquote">``I think we shall marry pretty
soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) repeated at last.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dreadful look again, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were some one
else. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you tell me that? It's no concern of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke out, <div class="bookquote">``don't you care, even if you do feel so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a button. Once you marry, it's quite the same to me when or where
or why you do it; and if you think to compound for your folly by hoisting
your flag in this way, you may spare yourself the trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With this he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned away. But the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own
accord, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner was somewhat changed. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you be married
within the next four or five months?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``It is not very easy for us to
make up our minds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Put it off, then, for six months, and in the meantime I will take you to
Europe. I should like you very much to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) such delight, after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) words of the day before, to hear that
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should <div class="bookquote">``like''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to do something, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) still had in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart
any of the tenderness of preference, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave a little exclamation
of joy. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) became conscious that Morris was not included in
this proposal, and that--as regards really going--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would greatly prefer
to remain at home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blushed, none the less, more
comfortably than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done of late. <div class="bookquote">``It would be delightful to go to
Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remarked, with a sense that the idea was not original, and
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tone was not all it might be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then, we will go. Pack up your clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had better tell Mr. Townsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cold eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``If you mean that you had
better ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) leave, all that remains to me is to hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will give it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl was sharply touched by the pathetic ring of the words; it was
the most calculated, the most dramatic little speech the Doctor had ever
uttered. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt that it was a great thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), under the
circumstances, to have this fine opportunity of showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) respect;
and yet there was something else that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt as well, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
presently expressed. <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes think that if I do what you dislike so
much, I ought not to stay with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To stay with me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I live with you, I ought to obey you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that's your theory, it's certainly mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor, with a dry
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if I don't obey you, I ought not to live with you--to enjoy your
kindness and protection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>This striking argument gave the Doctor a sudden sense of having
underestimated his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter; it seemed even more than worthy of a young
woman who had revealed the quality of unaggressive obstinacy. But it
displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)--displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) deeply, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) signified as much. <div class="bookquote">``That
idea is in very bad taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Did you get it from Mr. Townsend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; it's my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it to yourself, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father answered, more than ever
determined she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should go to Europe.




<p/>XXIII


<p/>IF Morris Townsend was not to be included in this journey, no more was
Mrs. Penniman, who would have been thankful for an invitation, but who
-LRB-to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) justice-RRB- bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) disappointment in a perfectly ladylike
manner. <div class="bookquote">``I should enjoy seeing the works of Raphael and the ruins--the
ruins of the Pantheon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said to Mrs. Almond; <div class="bookquote">``but, on the other hand,
I shall not be sorry to be alone and at peace for the next few months in
Washington Square. I want rest; I have been through so much in the last
four months.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond thought it rather cruel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) brother
should not take poor Lavinia abroad; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) easily understood that, if
the purpose of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) expedition was to make Catherine forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover, it
was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interest to give his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) daughter this young man's best friend
as a companion. <div class="bookquote">``If Lavinia had not been so foolish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) might visit the
ruins of the Pantheon,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said to herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued to regret
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sister's folly, even though the latter assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had often
heard the relics in question most satisfactorily described by Mr.
Penniman. Mrs. Penniman was perfectly aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother's motive in
undertaking a foreign tour was to lay a trap for Catherine's constancy;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imparted this conviction very frankly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) thinks it will make you forget Morris,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) always called
the young man <div class="bookquote">``Morris''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>now-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``out of sight, out of mind, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
thinks that all the things you will see over there will drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) out of
your thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine looked greatly alarmed. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thinks that, I ought to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) afterwards, my dear! After he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
has had all the trouble and the expense! That's the way to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) added, in a softer key, that it must be delightful to think of
those who love us among the ruins of the Pantheon.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father's displeasure had cost the girl, as we know, a great deal of
deep-welling sorrow--sorrow of the purest and most generous kind, without
a touch of resentment or rancour; but for the first time, after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
dismissed with such contemptuous brevity her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) apology for being a charge
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), there was a spark of anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) grief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had felt his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
contempt; it had scorched her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>); that speech about her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) bad taste made her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
ears burn for three days. During this period she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was less considerate;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had an idea--a rather vague one, but it was agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sense of
injury--that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was absolved from penance, and might do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
chose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) chose to write to Morris Townsend to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) in the Square
and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) to walk about the town. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) were going to Europe out of
respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) might at least give herself this satisfaction.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt in every way at present more free and more resolute; there was a
force that urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>). Now at last, completely and unreservedly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
passion possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>).

<p/>Morris met her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) at last, and they took a long walk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
immediately what had happened--that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) father wished to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) away.
It would be for six months, to Europe; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would do absolutely what
Morris should think best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) hoped inexpressibly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would think it
best she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) should stay at home. It was some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
thought: he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked, as they walked along, a great many questions. There
was one that especially struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>); it seemed so incongruous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like to see all those celebrated things over there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, Morris!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, quite deprecatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gracious Heaven, what a dull woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris exclaimed to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thinks I will forget you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine: <div class="bookquote">``that all these things
will drive you out of my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, perhaps they will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered gently, as they walked along.
<div class="bookquote">``Poor father will be disappointed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris gave a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I verily believe that your poor father
will be disappointed! But you will have seen Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added
humorously. <div class="bookquote">``What a take-in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for seeing Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to care, my dear. And it may mollify your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) obstinacy, expected little of this, and could
not rid herself of the idea that in going abroad and yet remaining firm,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should play her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father a trick. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think it would be a kind
of deception?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) want to deceive you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris. <div class="bookquote">``It will serve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
right! I really think you had better go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not be married for so long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be married when you come back. You can buy your wedding clothes in
Paris.''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And then Morris, with great kindness of tone, explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) view
of the matter. It would be a good thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should go; it would put
them completely in the right. It would show they were reasonable and
willing to wait. Once they were so sure of each other, they could afford
to wait--what had they to fear? If there was a particle of chance that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father would be favourably affected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) going, that ought to
settle it; for, after all, Morris was very unwilling to be the cause of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being disinherited. It was not for himself, it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was willing to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); it would be hard, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
could do it. And over there, among beautiful scenes and noble monuments,
perhaps the old gentleman would be softened; such things were supposed to
exert a humanising influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be touched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gentleness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
patience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) willingness to make any sacrifice but _that_ one; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) some day, in some celebrated spot--in Italy, say,
in the evening; in Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should be a
little clever about it and touch the right chord, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would fold
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Catherine was
immensely struck with this conception of the affair, which seemed
eminently worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover's brilliant intellect; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) viewed it
askance in so far as it depended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own powers of execution. The
idea of being <div class="bookquote">``clever''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in a gondola by moonlight appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
involve elements of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grasp was not active. But it was settled
between them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ready to follow
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) obediently anywhere, making the mental reservation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loved
Morris Townsend more than ever.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) informed the Doctor she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ready to embark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made rapid
arrangements for this event. Catherine had many farewells to make, but
with only two of them are we actively concerned. Mrs. Penniman took a
discriminating view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's journey; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) very proper
that Mr. Townsend's destined bride should wish to embellish her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) mind by a
foreign tour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in good hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lips to Catherine's
forehead. -LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was very fond of kissing people's foreheads; it was an
involuntary expression of sympathy with the intellectual part.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I shall
see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) often; I shall feel like one of the vestals of old, tending the
sacred flame.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You behave beautifully about not going with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered, not
presuming to examine this analogy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my pride that keeps me up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, tapping the body
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) dress, which always gave forth a sort of metallic ring.

<p/>Catherine's parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover was short, and few words were
exchanged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I find you just the same when I come back?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked; though the
question was not the fruit of scepticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The same--only more so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, smiling.

<p/>It does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail Dr. Sloper's
proceedings in the eastern hemisphere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) made the grand tour of Europe,
travelled in considerable splendour, and -LRB-as was to have been expected in
a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high cultivation-RRB- found so much in art and antiquity to
interest him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained abroad, not for six months, but for
twelve. Mrs. Penniman, in Washington Square, accommodated herself to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
absence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) uncontested dominion in the empty house, and
flattered herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) made it more attractive to their friends than
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother was at home. To Morris Townsend, at least, it would
have appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) made it singularly attractive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was altogether
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) most frequent visitor, and Mrs. Penniman was very fond of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
to tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) chair--a very easy one at the fireside in the back
parlour -LRB-when the great mahogany sliding-doors, with silver knobs and
hinges, which divided this apartment from its more formal neighbour, were
closed-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) used to smoke cigars in the Doctor's study, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
often spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its absent
proprietor. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) thought Mrs. Penniman a goose, as we know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was no
goose himself, and, as a young man of luxurious tastes and scanty
resources, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) found the house a perfect castle of indolence. It became
for him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) a club with a single member. Mrs. Penniman saw much less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
sister than while the Doctor was at home; for Mrs. Almond had felt moved
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) disapproved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) relations with Mr. Townsend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>)
had no business to be so friendly to a young man of whom their brother
thought so meanly, and Mrs. Almond was surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) levity in
foisting a most deplorable engagement upon Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Deplorable?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Aunt Lavinia</b></font>)</div>cried Lavinia. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will make her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) a lovely husband!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe in lovely husbands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond; <div class="bookquote">``I only believe
in good ones. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marries her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) comes into Austin's money, they
may get on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Austin</b></font>) will be an idle, amiable, selfish, and doubtless
tolerably good-natured fellow. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) doesn't get the money and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
finds himself tied to her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), Heaven have mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will have none.
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will hate her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) disappointment, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) revenge; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will be
pitiless and cruel. Woe betide poor Catherine! I recommend you to talk
a little with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sister; it's a pity Catherine can't marry _her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with Mrs.
Montgomery, whose acquaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) made no trouble to cultivate; and the
effect of this alarming forecast of her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) niece's destiny was to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>)
think it indeed a thousand pities that Mr. Townsend's generous nature
should be embittered. Bright enjoyment was his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) natural element, and how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) be comfortable if there should prove to be nothing to enjoy? It
became a fixed idea with Mrs. Penniman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) should yet enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
brother's fortune, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had acuteness enough to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
own claim was small.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't leave it to Catherine, it certainly won't be to leave it
to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said.




<p/>XXIV


<p/>THE Doctor, during the first six months he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was abroad, never spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
daughter of their little difference; partly on system, and partly because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had a great many other things to think about. It was idle to attempt
to ascertain the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) affections without direct inquiry, because,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not had an expressive manner among the familiar influences of
home, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) failed to gather animation from the mountains of Switzerland or
the monuments of Italy. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was always her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's docile and
reasonable associate--going through their sight-seeing in deferential
silence, never complaining of fatigue, always ready to start at the hour
he (<font color='blue'><b>associate</b></font>) had appointed over-night, making no foolish criticisms and indulging
in no refinements of appreciation. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is about as intelligent as the
bundle of shawls,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor said; her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) main superiority being that while
the bundle of shawls sometimes got lost, or tumbled out of the carriage,
Catherine was always at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) post, and had a firm and ample seat. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father had expected this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not constrained to set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
intellectual limitations as a tourist to sentimental depression; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
completely divested herself of the characteristics of a victim, and
during the whole time that they were abroad she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never uttered an audible
sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in correspondence with Morris Townsend; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
held his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) peace about it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) never saw the young man's letters, and
Catherine's own missives were always given to the courier to post. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover with considerable regularity, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) letters came
enclosed in Mrs. Penniman's; so that whenever the Doctor handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) a
packet addressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister's hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was an involuntary instrument
of the passion he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) condemned. Catherine made this reflexion, and six
months earlier she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have felt bound to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) warning; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
deemed herself absolved. There was a sore spot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) own
words had made when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought honour prompted;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would try and please him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would never
speak that way again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) read her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover's letters in secret.

<p/>One day at the end of the summer, the two travellers found themselves in
a lonely valley of the Alps. They were crossing one of the passes, and
on the long ascent they had got out of the carriage and had wandered much
in advance. After a while the Doctor descried a footpath which, leading
through a transverse valley, would bring them out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) justly supposed,
at a much higher point of the ascent. They followed this devious way,
and finally lost the path; the valley proved very wild and rough, and
their walk became rather a scramble. They were good walkers, however,
and they took their adventure easily; from time to time they stopped,
that Catherine might rest; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat upon a stone and looked about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at the hard-featured rocks and the glowing sky. It was late in the
afternoon, in the last of August; night was coming on, and, as they had
reached a great elevation, the air was cold and sharp. In the west there
was a great suffusion of cold, red light, which made the sides of the
little valley look only the more rugged and dusky. During one of their
pauses, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and wandered away to some high place, at a
distance, to get a view. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was out of sight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat there alone, in
the stillness, which was just touched by the vague murmur, somewhere, of
a mountain brook. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought of Morris Townsend, and the place was so
desolate and lonely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) seemed very far away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father remained
absent a long time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to wonder what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reappeared, coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in the clear twilight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got
up, to go on. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made no motion to proceed, however, but came close to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had something to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and stood
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with eyes that had kept the light of the flushing
snow-summits on which they had just been fixed. Then, abruptly, in a low
tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) an unexpected question:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you given him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was unexpected, but Catherine was only superficially
unprepared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, father!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again for some moments, without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) write to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--about twice a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked up and down the valley, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stick; then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), in the same low tone:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant--whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished to frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did,
the place was well chosen; this hard, melancholy dell, abandoned by the
summer light, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loneliness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart grew cold; for a moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fear was great. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
think of nothing to say, save to murmur gently, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You try my patience,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father went on, <div class="bookquote">``and you ought to know what I
am, I am not a very good man. Though I am very smooth externally, at
bottom I am very passionate; and I assure you I can be very hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not think why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) these things. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
there on purpose, and was it part of a plan? What was the plan?
Catherine asked herself. Was it to startle her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suddenly into a
retractation--to take an advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by dread? Dread of what? The
place was ugly and lonely, but the place could do her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) no harm. There was
a kind of still intensity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dangerous, but
Catherine hardly went so far as to say to herself that it might be part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) plan to fasten his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand--the neat, fine, supple hand of a
distinguished physician--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) throat. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) receded a step.
<div class="bookquote">``I am sure you can be anything you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. And it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
simple belief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied, more sharply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has it taken you so suddenly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has not taken me suddenly. I have been raging inwardly for the last
six months. But just now this seemed a good place to flare out. It's so
quiet, and we are alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's very quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine vaguely, looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Won't you come back to the carriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a moment. Do you mean that in all this time you have not yielded an
inch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would if I could, father; but I can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) too. <div class="bookquote">``Should you like to be left in such a
place as this, to starve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be your fate--that's how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will leave you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would not touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had touched Morris. The warmth came back
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``That is not true, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke out, <div class="bookquote">``and you ought
not to say it! It is not right, and it's not true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) head slowly. <div class="bookquote">``No, it's not right, because you won't believe
it. But it _is_ true. Come back to the carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) turned away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went faster, and was presently
much in advance. But from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stopped, without turning
round, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) keep up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way forward with
difficulty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart beating with the excitement of having for the first
time spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in violence. By this time it had grown almost dark,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ended by losing sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) course, and after
a little, the valley making a sudden turn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gained the road, where the
carriage stood waiting. In it sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, rigid and silent; in
silence, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place beside him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), later, in looking back upon all this, that for days
afterwards not a word had been exchanged between them. The scene had
been a strange one, but it had not permanently affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feeling
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, for it was natural, after all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should
occasionally make a scene of some kind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone for six
months. The strangest part of it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not a good
man; Catherine wondered a great deal what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had meant by that. The
statement failed to appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) credence, and it was not grateful to
any resentment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entertained. Even in the utmost bitterness that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might feel, it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) no satisfaction to think him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) less
complete. Such a saying as that was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great subtlety--men so
clever as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might say anything and mean anything. And as to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being
hard, that surely, in a man, was a virtue.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone for six months more--six months during which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
accommodated herself without a protest to the extension of their tour.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke again at the end of this time; it was at the very last, the
night before they embarked for New York, in the hotel at Liverpool. They
had been dining together in a great dim, musty sitting-room; and then the
cloth had been removed, and the Doctor walked slowly up and down.
Catherine at last took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) candle to go to bed, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father motioned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to stay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean to do when you get home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood
there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean about Mr. Townsend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About Mr. Townsend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall probably marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor took several turns again while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waited. <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) as much as ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; twice a month,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine promptly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And does he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) always talk about marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes! That is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) talks about other things too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) always says
something about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) varies his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) subjects; his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) letters might otherwise be
monotonous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) writes beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, who was very glad of a chance to
say it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They always write beautifully. However, in a given case that doesn't
diminish the merit. So, as soon as you arrive, you are going off with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and something that there
was of dignity in Catherine resented it. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell you till we
arrive,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's reasonable enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father answered. <div class="bookquote">``That's all I ask of
you--that you _do_ tell me, that you give me definite notice. When a poor
man is to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only child, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes to have an inkling of it
beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, father, you will not lose me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said, spilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
candle-wax.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three days before will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``if you are in a position to be
positive then. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought to be very thankful to me, do you know. I have
done a mighty good thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in taking you abroad; your value is
twice as great, with all the knowledge and taste that you have acquired.
A year ago, you were perhaps a little limited--a little rustic; but now
you have seen everything, and appreciated everything, and you will be a
most entertaining companion. We have fattened the sheep for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) before
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) kills it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Catherine turned away, and stood staring at the blank door.
<div class="bookquote">``Go to bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``and, as we don't go aboard till noon, you
may sleep late. We shall probably have a most uncomfortable voyage.''




 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>XXV


<p/>THE voyage was indeed uncomfortable, and Catherine, on arriving in New
York, had not the compensation of <div class="bookquote">``going off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's phrase,
with Morris Townsend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), however, the day after she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) landed;
and, in the meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) formed a natural subject of conversation between
our heroine and her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) Aunt Lavinia, with whom, the night she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) disembarked,
the girl was closeted for a long time before either lady retired to rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is not very
easy to know. I suppose you think you know him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); but you don't, my dear.
You will some day; but it will only be after you have lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>). I
may almost say _I_ have lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman proceeded, while
Catherine stared. <div class="bookquote">``I think I know him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) now; I have had such remarkable
opportunities. You will have the same--or rather, you will have better!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>and Aunt Lavinia smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Then you will see what I mean. It's a
wonderful character, full of passion and energy, and just as true!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine listened with a mixture of interest and apprehension. Aunt
Lavinia was intensely sympathetic, and Catherine, for the past year,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wandered through foreign galleries and churches, and rolled
over the smoothness of posting roads, nursing the thoughts that never
passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips, had often longed for the company of some intelligent
person of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own sex. To tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) story to some kind woman--at moments
it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that this would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comfort, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had more than
once been on the point of taking the landlady, or the nice young person
from the dressmaker's, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) confidence. If a woman had been near her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would on certain occasions have treated such a companion to a fit of
weeping; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had an apprehension that, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) return, this would form
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) response to Aunt Lavinia's first embrace. In fact, however, the two
ladies had met, in Washington Square, without tears, and when they found
themselves alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girl's emotion.
It came over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a greater force that Mrs. Penniman had enjoyed a
whole year of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lover's society, and it was not a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) to
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aunt explain and interpret the young man, speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were supreme. It was not that Catherine was
jealous; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sense of Mrs. Penniman's innocent falsity, which had
lain dormant, began to haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
safely at home. With this, however, it was a blessing to be able to talk
of Morris, to sound his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) name, to be with a person who was not unjust to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has written me
that, often. I shall never forget that, Aunt Lavinia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have done what I could; it has been very little. To let him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) come and
talk to me, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cup of tea--that was all. Your Aunt Almond
thought it was too much, and used to scold me terribly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) promised
me, at least, not to betray me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To betray you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to tell your father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used to sit in your father's study!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Penniman, with a little laugh.

<p/>Catherine was silent a moment. This idea was disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was reminded again, with pain, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt's secretive habits.
Morris, the reader may be informed, had had the tact not to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) but for a few months, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for fifteen years; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would not have made
the mistake of thinking that Catherine would see the joke of the thing.
<div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go into father's room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, after a while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) liked to look at the books,
and all those things in the glass cases. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows all about them; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
knows all about everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was silent again; then, <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had found some employment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has found some employment! It's beautiful news, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me to
tell you as soon as you arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has gone into partnership with a
commission merchant. It was all settled, quite suddenly, a week ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news; it had a fine prosperous
air. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm so glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; and now, for a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
disposed to throw herself on Aunt Lavinia's neck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's much better than being under some one; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has never been used
to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is just as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) partner--they
are perfectly equal! You see how right he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was to wait. I should like to
know what your father can say now! They have got an office in Duane
Street, and little printed cards; he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) brought me one to show me. I have
got it in my room, and you shall see it to-morrow. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) said
to me the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was here--`You see how right I was to wait!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>)
has got other people under him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>), instead of being a subordinate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) could
never be a subordinate; I have often told him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) I could never think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>)
in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine assented to this proposition, and was very happy to know that
Morris was his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own master; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was deprived of the satisfaction of
thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might communicate this news in triumph to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father would care equally little whether Morris were established in
business or transported for life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trunks had been brought into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
room, and further reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover was for a short time suspended,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opened them and displayed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt some of the spoils of
foreign travel. These were rich and abundant; and Catherine had brought
home a present to every one--to every one save Morris, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
brought simply her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) undiverted heart. To Mrs. Penniman she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had been
lavishly generous, and Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and
folding again, with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
marched about for some time in a splendid cashmere shawl, which Catherine
had begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to accept, settling it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoulders, and twisting down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head to see how low the point descended behind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall regard it only as a loan,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I will leave it to you
again when I die; or rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece again, <div class="bookquote">``I will
leave it to your first-born little girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>niece</b></font>)</div>And draped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shawl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stood there smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like the way you say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman rejoined, in a moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Catherine, are you changed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not swerved a line?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am exactly the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine repeated, wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt were a
little less sympathetic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Penniman surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cashmere in the glass.
Then, <div class="bookquote">``How is your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) asked in a moment, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
niece. <div class="bookquote">``Your letters were so meagre--I could never tell!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father is very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you know what I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with a dignity to which
the cashmere gave a richer effect. <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) still implacable!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite unchanged?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is, if possible, more firm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) great shawl, and slowly folded it up. <div class="bookquote">``That
is very bad. You had no success with your little project?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What little project?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Morris told me all about it. The idea of turning the tables on him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), in
Europe; of watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was agreeably impressed by some
celebrated sight--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) pretends to be so artistic, you know--and then just
pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) and bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never tried it. It was Morris's idea; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had been with us, in
Europe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would have seen that father was never impressed in that way.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) _is_ artistic--tremendously artistic; but the more celebrated places we
visited, and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) admired them, the less use it would have been to
plead with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). They seemed only to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more determined--more
terrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said poor Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) round, and I
expect nothing now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I must say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman answered, <div class="bookquote">``I never supposed you were
going to give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have given it up. I don't care now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have grown very brave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with a short laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I
didn't advise you to sacrifice your property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am braver than I was. You asked me if I had changed; I have
changed in that way. Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl went on, <div class="bookquote">``I have changed very much.
And it isn't my property. If _he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)_ doesn't care for it, why should I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) does care for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cares for it for my sake, because he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) doesn't want to injure me. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will know--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows already--how little he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) need be afraid about that.
Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``I have got plenty of money of my own. We
shall be very well off; and now hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) business? I am
delighted about that business.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) went on talking, showing a good deal
of excitement as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) proceeded. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aunt had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) with just
this manner, and Mrs. Penniman, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>), set it down to foreign
travel, which had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) more positive, more mature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) thought also
that Catherine had improved in appearance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked rather handsome.
Mrs. Penniman wondered whether Morris Townsend would be struck with that.
While she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was engaged in this speculation, Catherine broke out, with a
certain sharpness, <div class="bookquote">``Why are you so contradictory, Aunt Penniman? You
seem to think one thing at one time, and another at another. A year ago,
before I went away, you wished me not to mind about displeasing father;
and now you seem to recommend me to take another line. You change about
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This attack was unexpected, for Mrs. Penniman was not used, in any
discussion, to seeing the war carried into her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own country--possibly
because the enemy generally had doubts of finding subsistence there. To
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own consciousness, the flowery fields of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) reason had rarely been
ravaged by a hostile force. It was perhaps on this account that in
defending them she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was majestic rather than agile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you accuse me of, save of being too deeply interested
in your happiness. It is the first time I have been told I am
capricious. That fault is not what I am usually reproached with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were angry last year that I wouldn't marry immediately, and now you
talk about my winning my father over. You told me it would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
right if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should take me to Europe for nothing. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has taken me
for nothing, and you ought to be satisfied. Nothing is changed--nothing
but my feeling about father. I don't mind nearly so much now. I have
been as good as I could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doesn't care. Now I don't care either.
I don't know whether I have grown bad; perhaps I have. But I don't care
for that. I have come home to be married--that's all I know. That ought
to please you, unless you have taken up some new idea; you are so
strange. You may do as you please; but you must never speak to me again
about pleading with father. I shall never plead with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for anything;
that is all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has put me off. I am come home to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a more authoritative speech than she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had ever heard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
niece's lips, and Mrs. Penniman was proportionately startled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was
indeed a little awestruck, and the force of the girl's emotion and
resolution left her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) nothing to reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was easily frightened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
always carried off her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) discomfiture by a concession; a concession which
was often accompanied, as in the present case, by a little nervous laugh.




<p/>XXVI


<p/>IF she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's temper--she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) began from this moment
forward to talk a good deal about Catherine's temper, an article which up
to that time had never been mentioned in connexion with our
heroine--Catherine had opportunity, on the morrow, to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
serenity. Mrs. Penniman had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) a message from Morris Townsend, to
the effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would come and welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) home on the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
arrival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) came in the afternoon; but, as may be imagined, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was not
on this occasion made free of Dr. Sloper's study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had been coming and
going, for the past year, so comfortably and irresponsibly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had a
certain sense of being wronged by finding himself reminded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) must
now limit his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) horizon to the front parlour, which was Catherine's
particular province.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you have come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it makes me very happy to
see you again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), smiling, from head to foot; though
it did not appear, afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) agreed with Mrs. Penniman -LRB-who,
womanlike, went more into details-RRB- in thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) embellished.

<p/>To Catherine he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) appeared resplendent; it was some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
believe again that this beautiful young man was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own exclusive
property. They had a great deal of characteristic lovers' talk--a soft
exchange of inquiries and assurances. In these matters Morris had an
excellent grace, which flung a picturesque interest even over the account
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) début in the commission business--a subject as to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
companion earnestly questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) got up from the
sofa where they sat together, and walked about the room; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
came back, smiling and passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was
unquiet, as was natural in a young man who has just been reunited to a
long-absent mistress, and Catherine made the reflexion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) so excited. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pleasure, somehow, to note this fact.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) travels, to some of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was unable
to reply, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had forgotten the names of places, and the order of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father's journey. But for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was so happy, so lifted up by
the belief that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) troubles at last were over, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forgot to be
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) meagre answers. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could marry
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) without the remnant of a scruple or a single tremor save those that
belonged to joy. Without waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to ask, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father had come back in exactly the same state of mind--that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not
yielded an inch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not expect it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and we must do without it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris sat looking and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``My poor dear girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mustn't pity me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind it now--I am used to
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris continued to smile, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) got up and walked about again.
<div class="bookquote">``You had better let me try him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) over? You would only make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine
answered resolutely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say that because I managed it so badly before. But I should manage
it differently now. I am much wiser; I have had a year to think of it.
I have more tact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what you have been thinking of for a year?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Much of the time. You see, the idea sticks in my crop. I don't like to
be beaten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you beaten if we marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I am not beaten on the main issue; but I am, don't you see,
on all the rest of it--on the question of my reputation, of my relations
with your father, of my relations with my own children, if we should have
any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have enough for our children--we shall have enough for
everything. Don't you expect to succeed in business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brilliantly, and we shall certainly be very comfortable. But it isn't
of the mere material comfort I speak; it is of the moral comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said
Morris--<div class="bookquote">``of the intellectual satisfaction!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have great moral comfort now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine declared, very simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have. But with me it is different. I have staked my
pride on proving to your father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is wrong; and now that I am at
the head of a flourishing business, I can deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as an equal. I
have a capital plan--do let me go at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) bright face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) jaunty air, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hands in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) pockets; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got up, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Please
don't, Morris; please don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said; and there was a certain mild, sad
firmness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) heard for the first time. <div class="bookquote">``We must ask no
favours of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)--we must ask nothing more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) won't relent, and nothing
good will come of it. I know it now--I have a very good reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray; what is your reason?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated to bring it out, but at last it came. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is not very fond
of me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't say such a thing without being sure. I saw it, I felt it, in
England, just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) came away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) talked to me one night--the last
night; and then it came over me. You can tell when a person feels that
way. I wouldn't accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hadn't made me feel that way. I don't
accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>); I just tell you that that's how it is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) can't help it; we
can't govern our affections. Do I govern mine? mightn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) say that to
me? It's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is so fond of my mother, whom we lost so long ago.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was beautiful, and very, very brilliant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is always thinking of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I am not at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); Aunt Penniman has told me that. Of
course, it isn't my fault; but neither is it his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) fault. All I mean is,
it's true; and it's a stronger reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) never being reconciled than
simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) dislike for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Simply?''' cried Morris, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged for that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) disliking you now; I mind everything less. I
feel differently; I feel separated from my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, <div class="bookquote">``you are a queer family!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say that--don't say anything unkind,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl entreated. <div class="bookquote">``You
must be very kind to me now, because, Morris--because,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated
a moment--<div class="bookquote">``because I have done a great deal for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know that, my dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward sign of
emotion, gently, reasoningly, only trying to explain. But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) emotion
had been ineffectually smothered, and it betrayed itself at last in the
trembling of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``It is a great thing to be separated like that
from your father, when you have worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before. It has made me
very unhappy; or it would have made me so if I didn't love you. You can
tell when a person speaks to you as if--as if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if they despised you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine passionately. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke that
way the night before we sailed. It wasn't much, but it was enough, and I
thought of it on the voyage, all the time. Then I made up my mind. I
will never ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for anything again, or expect anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It
would not be natural now. We must be very happy together, and we must
not seem to depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) forgiveness. And Morris, Morris, you must
never despise me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>This was an easy promise to make, and Morris made it with fine effect.
But for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) undertook nothing more onerous.




<p/>XXVII


<p/>THE Doctor, of course, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) return, had a good deal of talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was at no great pains to narrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) travels or to
communicate his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) impressions of distant lands to Mrs. Penniman, upon whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) contented himself with bestowing a memento of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) enviable experience,
in the shape of a velvet gown. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) at some length
about matters nearer home, and lost no time in assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
still an inflexible father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt you have seen a great deal of Mr. Townsend, and done
your best to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) for Catherine's absence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I don't ask
you, and you needn't deny it. I wouldn't put the question to you for the
world, and expose you to the inconvenience of having to--a--excogitate an
answer. No one has betrayed you, and there has been no spy upon your
proceedings. Elizabeth has told no tales, and has never mentioned you
except to praise your good looks and good spirits. The thing is simply
an inference of my own--an induction, as the philosophers say. It seems
to me likely that you would have offered an asylum to an interesting
sufferer. Mr. Townsend has been a good deal in the house; there is
something in the house that tells me so. We doctors, you know, end by
acquiring fine perceptions, and it is impressed upon my sensorium that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
has sat in these chairs, in a very easy attitude, and warmed himself at
that fire. I don't grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) the comfort of it; it is the only one he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
will ever enjoy at my expense. It seems likely, indeed, that I shall be
able to economise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) own. I don't know what you may have said to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), or what you may say hereafter; but I should like you to know that if
you have encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will gain anything by hanging
on, or that I have budged a hair's-breadth from the position I took up a
year ago, you have played him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) a trick for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) may exact reparation.
I'm not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) may not bring a suit against you. Of course you
have done it conscientiously; you have made yourself believe that I can
be tired out. This is the most baseless hallucination that ever visited
the brain of a genial optimist. I am not in the least tired; I am as
fresh as when I started; I am good for fifty years yet. Catherine
appears not to have budged an inch either; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is equally fresh; so we
are about where we were before. This, however, you know as well as I.
What I wish is simply to give you notice of my own state of mind! Take
it to heart, dear Lavinia. Beware of the just resentment of a deluded
fortune-hunter!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I expected it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``And I had a sort of
foolish hope that you would come home without that odious ironical tone
with which you treat the most sacred subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't undervalue irony, it is often of great use. It is not, however,
always necessary, and I will show you how gracefully I can lay it aside.
I should like to know whether you think Morris Townsend will hang on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will answer you with your own weapons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``You had
better wait and see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call such a speech as that one of my own weapons? I never said
anything so rough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will hang on long enough to make you very uncomfortable, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the Doctor, <div class="bookquote">``do you call that irony? I call
it pugilism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman, however, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) pugilism, was a good deal
frightened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) took counsel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) fears. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother meanwhile
took counsel, with many reservations, of Mrs. Almond, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was no
less generous than to Lavinia, and a good deal more communicative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) has had him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) there all the while,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I must look
into the state of my wine! You needn't mind telling me now; I have
already said all I mean to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was in the house a good deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond answered. <div class="bookquote">``But
you must admit that your leaving Lavinia quite alone was a great change
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>), and that it was natural she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) should want some society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do admit that, and that is why I shall make no row about the wine; I
shall set it down as compensation to Lavinia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) is capable of telling
me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) drank it all herself. Think of the inconceivable bad taste,
in the circumstances, of that fellow making free with the house--or coming
there at all! If that doesn't describe him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is indescribable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) plan is to get what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can. Lavinia will have supported him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for a
year,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond. <div class="bookquote">``It's so much gained.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) will have to support him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) life, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>cried the
Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``But without wine, as they say at the _tables d’hôte_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has set up a business, and is making a great deal
of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor stared. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has not told me that--and Lavinia didn't deign.
Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Catherine has given me up. Not that it matters, for all
that the business amounts to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has not given up Mr. Townsend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond. <div class="bookquote">``I saw that in
the first half minute. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has come home exactly the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly the same; not a grain more intelligent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) didn't notice a
stick or a stone all the while we were away--not a picture nor a view, not
a statue nor a cathedral.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had other things to think of; they are never
for an instant out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) touches me very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would touch me if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) didn't irritate me. That's the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has
upon me now. I have tried everything upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); I really have been quite
merciless. But it is of no use whatever; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is absolutely _glued_. I
have passed, in consequence, into the exasperated stage. At first I had
a good deal of a certain genial curiosity about it; I wanted to see if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) really would stick. But, good Lord, one's curiosity is satisfied! I
see she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is capable of it, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) can let go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will never let go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, or you will exasperate me too. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doesn't let go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
will be shaken off--sent tumbling into the dust! That's a nice position
for my daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can't see that if you are going to be pushed you
had better jump. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bruises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will never complain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I shall object to even more. But the deuce will be that I can't
prevent anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is to have a fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond, with a gentle laugh, <div class="bookquote">``we
must spread as many carpets as we can.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) carried out this idea by
showing a great deal of motherly kindness to the girl.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman immediately wrote to Morris Townsend. The intimacy between
these two was by this time consummate, but I must content myself with
noting but a few of its features. Mrs. Penniman's own share in it was a
singular sentiment, which might have been misinterpreted, but which in
itself was not discreditable to the poor lady. It was a romantic
interest in this attractive and unfortunate young man, and yet it was not
such an interest as Catherine might have been jealous of. Mrs. Penniman
had not a particle of jealousy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece. For herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) were Morris's mother or sister--a mother or sister of an emotional
temperament--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had an absorbing desire to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) comfortable and
happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had striven to do so during the year that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) an open field, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) efforts had been attended with the success
that has been pointed out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had never had a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own, and
Catherine, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) best to invest with the importance that
would naturally belong to a youthful Penniman, had only partly rewarded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) zeal. Catherine, as an object of affection and solicitude, had never
had that picturesque charm which -LRB-as it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)-RRB- would have been a
natural attribute of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own progeny. Even the maternal passion in Mrs.
Penniman would have been romantic and factitious, and Catherine was not
constituted to inspire a romantic passion. Mrs. Penniman was as fond of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) as ever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had grown to feel that with Catherine she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lacked
opportunity. Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
not disinherited her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece-RRB- adopted Morris Townsend, who gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
opportunity in abundance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have been very happy to have a
handsome and tyrannical son, and would have taken an extreme interest in
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) love affairs. This was the light in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had come to regard
Morris, who had conciliated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at first, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) impression by his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
delicate and calculated deference--a sort of exhibition to which Mrs.
Penniman was particularly sensitive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had largely abated his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) deference
afterwards, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) economised his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) resources, but the impression was made,
and the young man's very brutality came to have a sort of filial value.
If Mrs. Penniman had had a son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would probably have been afraid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and at this stage of our narrative she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was certainly afraid of
Morris Townsend. This was one of the results of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) domestication in
Washington Square. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) ease with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)--as, for that matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
would certainly have done with his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) own mother.




<p/>XXVIII


<p/>THE letter was a word of warning; it informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) that the Doctor had
come home more impracticable than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have reflected that
Catherine would supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) with all the information he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) needed on this
point; but we know that Mrs. Penniman's reflexions were rarely just; and,
moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt that it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) to depend on what Catherine
might do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) duty, quite irrespective of Catherine. I
have said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) young friend took his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ease with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and it is an
illustration of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made no answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took
note of it, amply; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cigar with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) waited, in
tranquil confidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should receive another. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) state of mind
really freezes my blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman had written, alluding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
brother; and it would have seemed that upon this statement she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) could
hardly improve. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wrote again, expressing herself with
the aid of a different figure. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hatred of you burns with a lurid
flame--the flame that never dies,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wrote. <div class="bookquote">``But it doesn't light up
the darkness of your future. If my affection could do so, all the years
of your life would be an eternal sunshine. I can extract nothing from
C.; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is so terribly secretive, like her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) seems to expect
to be married very soon, and has evidently made preparations in
Europe--quantities of clothing, ten pairs of shoes, etc.. My dear friend,
you cannot set up in married life simply with a few pairs of shoes, can
you? Tell me what you think of this. I am intensely anxious to see you;
I have so much to say. I miss you dreadfully; the house seems so empty
without you. What is the news down town? Is the business extending?
That dear little business--I think it's so brave of you! Couldn't I come
to your office?--just for three minutes? I might pass for a customer--is
that what you call them? I might come in to buy something--some shares or
some railroad things. _Tell me what you think of this plan_. I would
carry a little reticule, like a woman of the people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Morris appeared to think
poorly of the plan, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) gave Mrs. Penniman no encouragement whatever
to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) office, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had already represented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) as a place
peculiarly and unnaturally difficult to find. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) persisted in
desiring an interview--up to the last, after months of intimate colloquy,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) called these meetings <div class="bookquote">``interviews'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) agreed that they should take a
walk together, and was even kind enough to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) office for this
purpose, during the hours at which business might have been supposed to
be liveliest. It was no surprise to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), when they met at a street
corner, in a region of empty lots and undeveloped pavements -LRB-Mrs.
Penniman being attired as much as possible like a <div class="bookquote">``woman of the people'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>-RRB-,
to find that, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) urgency, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) chiefly had to convey to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sympathy. Of such assurances, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
had already a voluminous collection, and it would not have been worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
while to forsake a fruitful avocation merely to hear Mrs. Penniman say,
for the thousandth time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own. Morris had
something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own to say. It was not an easy thing to bring out, and
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) turned it over the difficulty made him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) acrimonious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I know perfectly that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) combines the properties of a lump of
ice and a red-hot coal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) observed. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine has made it thoroughly
clear, and you have told me so till I am sick of it. You needn't tell me
again; I am perfectly satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will never give us a penny; I regard
that as mathematically proved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman at this point had an inspiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you bring a lawsuit against him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wondered that this
simple expedient had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will bring a lawsuit against _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, <div class="bookquote">``if you ask me any
more such aggravating questions. A man should know when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is beaten,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added, in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``I must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman received this declaration in silence, though it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
heart beat a little. It found her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) by no means unprepared, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had
accustomed herself to the thought that, if Morris should decidedly not be
able to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother's money, it would not do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) to marry
Catherine without it. <div class="bookquote">``It would not do''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>was a vague way of putting the
thing; but Mrs. Penniman's natural affection completed the idea, which,
though it had not as yet been so crudely expressed between them as in the
form that Morris had just given it, had nevertheless been implied so
often, in certain easy intervals of talk, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sat stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) legs
in the Doctor's well-stuffed armchairs, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had grown first to
regard it with an emotion which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) flattered herself was philosophic,
and then to have a secret tenderness for it. The fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
tenderness secret proves, of course, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was ashamed of it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
managed to blink her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) shame by reminding herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was, after all,
the official protector of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's marriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) logic would scarcely
have passed muster with the Doctor. In the first place, Morris _must_
get the money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) to it. In the second, it was plain
it would never come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), and it would be a grievous pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should
marry without it--a young man who might so easily find something better.
After her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother had delivered himself, on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) return from Europe, of
that incisive little address that has been quoted, Morris's cause seemed
so hopeless that Mrs. Penniman fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) attention exclusively upon the
latter branch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) argument. If Morris had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) son, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would
certainly have sacrificed Catherine to a superior conception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
future; and to be ready to do so as the case stood was therefore even a
finer degree of devotion. Nevertheless, it checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) breath a little
to have the sacrificial knife, as it were, suddenly thrust into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Morris walked along a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) repeated harshly: <div class="bookquote">``I must give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly say it distinctly enough--brutally and vulgarly enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was ashamed of himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) shame was uncomfortable; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was
extremely intolerant of discomfort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) felt vicious and cruel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) wanted
to abuse somebody, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) began, cautiously--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was always
cautious--with himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you take her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) down a little?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--try and ease me off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman stopped, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) very solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor Morris, do you know how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loves you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't. I don't want to know. I have always tried to keep from
knowing. It would be too painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will suffer much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must console her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). If you are as good a friend to me as you pretend
to be, you will manage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk of my `pretending' to like you; but I can't pretend to hate
you. I can only tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) I think very highly of you; and how will that
console her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for losing you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Doctor will help you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) will be delighted at the thing being
broken off, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is a knowing fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) will invent something to
comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) will invent a new torture!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Penniman. ``Heaven deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's comfort. It will consist of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) crowing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and
saying, `I always told you so!'''

<p/>Morris coloured a most uncomfortable red.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't console her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) any better than you console me, you certainly
won't be of much use! It's a damned disagreeable necessity; I feel it
extremely, and you ought to make it easy for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be your friend for life!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be my friend _now_!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And Morris walked on.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was almost trembling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like me to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but
you can--you can--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hesitated, trying to think what Mrs. Penniman
could do. <div class="bookquote">``You can explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) why it is. It's because I can't bring
myself to step in between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father--to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the pretext he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
grasps at--so eagerly -LRB-it's a hideous sight-RRB- for depriving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of this formula.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's so like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's so finely felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stick an angry swing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, botheration!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) exclaimed perversely.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman, however, was not discouraged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It may turn out better than you think. Catherine is, after all, so very
peculiar.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) might take it upon herself to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
that, whatever happened, the girl would be very quiet--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wouldn't make a
noise. They extended their walk, and, while they proceeded, Mrs.
Penniman took upon herself other things besides, and ended by having
assumed a considerable burden; Morris being ready enough, as may be
imagined, to put everything off upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was not for a single
instant the dupe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) blundering alacrity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) knew that of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
promised she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was competent to perform but an insignificant fraction, and
the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) professed her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) willingness to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), the greater fool he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you do if you don't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) ventured to inquire in the
course of this conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something brilliant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't you like me to do
something brilliant?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea gave Mrs. Penniman exceeding pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall feel sadly taken in if you don't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to, to make up for this. This isn't at all brilliant, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman mused a little, as if there might be some way of making out
that it was; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had to give up the attempt, and, to carry off the
awkwardness of failure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) risked a new inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean--do you mean another marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris greeted this question with a reflexion which was hardly the less
impudent from being inaudible. <div class="bookquote">``Surely, women are more crude than men!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) answered audibly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman felt disappointed and snubbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) relieved herself in
a little vaguely-sarcastic cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was certainly perverse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) up, not for another woman, but for a wider career!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris
announced.

<p/>This was very grand; but still Mrs. Penniman, who felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had
exposed herself, was faintly rancorous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean never to come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) asked, with some
sharpness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I shall come again; but what is the use of dragging it out? I
have been four times since she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) came back, and it's terribly awkward work.
I can't keep it up indefinitely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) oughtn't to expect that, you know.
A woman should never keep a man dangling!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added finely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but you must have your last parting!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>urged his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) companion, in whose
imagination the idea of last partings occupied a place inferior in
dignity only to that of first meetings.




<p/>XXIX


<p/>HE (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) came again, without managing the last parting; and again and again,
without finding that Mrs. Penniman had as yet done much to pave the path
of retreat with flowers. It was devilish awkward, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
felt a lively animosity for Catherine's aunt, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had now quite
formed the habit of saying to himself, had dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) into the mess and
was bound in common charity to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) out of it. Mrs. Penniman, to tell
the truth, had, in the seclusion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own apartment--and, I may add,
amid the suggestiveness of Catherine's, which wore in those days the
appearance of that of a young lady laying out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) _trousseau_--Mrs.
Penniman had measured her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) responsibilities, and taken fright at their
magnitude. The task of preparing Catherine and easing off Morris
presented difficulties which increased in the execution, and even led the
impulsive Lavinia to ask herself whether the modification of the young
man's original project had been conceived in a happy spirit. A brilliant
future, a wider career, a conscience exempt from the reproach of
interference between a young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) natural rights--these excellent
things might be too troublesomely purchased. From Catherine herself Mrs.
Penniman received no assistance whatever; the poor girl was apparently
without suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) danger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lover with eyes of
undiminished trust, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had less confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aunt than
in a young man with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had exchanged so many tender vows, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) no handle for explaining or confessing. Mrs. Penniman, faltering and
wavering, declared Catherine was very stupid, put off the great scene, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have called it, from day to day, and wandered about very
uncomfortably, primed, to repletion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apology, but unable to
bring it to the light. Morris's own scenes were very small ones just
now; but even these were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) visits as
brief as possible, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) mistress, found terribly
little to talk about. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), in vulgar parlance, to
name the day; and so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was unprepared to be explicit on this
point it seemed a mockery to pretend to talk about matters more abstract.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had no airs and no arts; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) never attempted to disguise her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
expectancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was waiting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) good pleasure, and would wait
modestly and patiently; his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hanging back at this supreme time might
appear strange, but of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) must have a good reason for it.
Catherine would have made a wife of the gentle old-fashioned
pattern--regarding reasons as favours and windfalls, but no more expecting
one every day than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would have expected a bouquet of camellias.
During the period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) engagement, however, a young lady even of the
most slender pretensions counts upon more bouquets than at other times;
and there was a want of perfume in the air at this moment which at last
excited the girl's alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sick?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked of Morris. <div class="bookquote">``You seem so restless, and you look
pale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris; and it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
could only make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) might get off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are overworked; you oughtn't to work so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must do that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added, with a sort of calculated
brutality, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to owe you everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, how can you say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am too proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--you are too proud!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must take me as I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``you can never change me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to change you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said gently. <div class="bookquote">``I will take you as you
are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know people talk tremendously about a man's marrying a rich girl,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris remarked. <div class="bookquote">``It's excessively disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not rich?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are rich enough to make me talked about!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you are talked about. It's an honour!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an honour I could easily dispense with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was on the point of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) whether it were not a compensation for
this annoyance that the poor girl who had the misfortune to bring it upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) so dearly and believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) so truly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hesitated,
thinking that this would perhaps seem an exacting speech, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hesitated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) suddenly left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/>The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) came, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought it out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was too proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) repeated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) couldn't change, and
this time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the impulse to say that with a little effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) might
change.

<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thought that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) could only make a quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) it
might help him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>); but the question was how to quarrel with a young woman
who had such treasures of concession. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you think the effort is
all on your side!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was reduced to exclaiming. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you believe that
I have my own effort to make?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all yours now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My effort is finished and done with!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, mine is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must bear things together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``That's what we ought to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris attempted a natural smile. <div class="bookquote">``There are some things which we can't
very well bear together--for instance, separation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you speak of separation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you don't like it; I knew you wouldn't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going, Morris?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suddenly asked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a moment, and for a part of that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was afraid of it. <div class="bookquote">``Will you promise not to make a scene?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A scene!--do I make scenes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All women do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, with the tone of large experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't. Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I should say I was going away on business, should you think it very
strange?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wondered a moment, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Yes--no. Not if you will take me
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take you with me--on business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your business? Your business is to be with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't earn my living with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Or rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) cried
with a sudden inspiration, <div class="bookquote">``that's just what I do--or what the world says
I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This ought perhaps to have been a great stroke, but it miscarried.
<div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine simply repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To New Orleans. About buying some cotton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly willing to go to New Orleans.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I would take you to a nest of yellow fever?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried
Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I would expose you at such a time as this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is yellow fever, why should you go? Morris, you must not go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is to make six thousand dollars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Do you grudge me
that satisfaction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have no need of six thousand dollars. You think too much about
money!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can afford to say that? This is a great chance; we heard of it last
night.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in what the chance consisted; and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a long story, going over more than once several of the details, about
the remarkable stroke of business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) partner had planned
between them.

<p/>But Catherine's imagination, for reasons best known to herself,
absolutely refused to be fired. <div class="bookquote">``If you can go to New Orleans, I can
go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't you catch yellow fever quite as easily as
I? I am every bit as strong as you, and not in the least afraid of any
fever. When we were in Europe, we were in very unhealthy places; my
father used to make me take some pills. I never caught anything, and I
never was nervous. What will be the use of six thousand dollars if you
die of a fever? When persons are going to be married they oughtn't to
think so much about business. You shouldn't think about cotton, you
should think about me. You can go to New Orleans some other time--there
will always be plenty of cotton. It isn't the moment to choose--we have
waited too long already.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke more forcibly and volubly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
had ever heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) arm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) two hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said you wouldn't make a scene!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris. <div class="bookquote">``I call this a
scene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's you that are making it! I have never asked you anything before.
We have waited too long already.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And it was a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had hitherto asked so little; it seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) right to
insist the greater now.

<p/>Morris bethought himself a little. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, then; we won't talk about
it any more. I will transact my business by letter.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) began to
smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat, as if to take leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't go?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) could not give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) idea of provoking a quarrel; it was so much the
simplest way! He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) upturned face, with the darkest
frown he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) could achieve. <div class="bookquote">``You are not discreet. You mustn't bully me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But, as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conceded everything. <div class="bookquote">``No, I am not discreet; I know I
am too pressing. But isn't it natural? It is only for a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a moment you may do a great deal of harm. Try and be calmer the next
time I come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When will you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to make conditions?''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris asked. <div class="bookquote">``I will come next
Saturday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine begged; <div class="bookquote">``I want you to come to-morrow. I
will be very quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) agitation had by this time become
so great that the assurance was not becoming. A sudden fear had come
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); it was like the solid conjunction of a dozen disembodied
doubts, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination, at a single bound, had traversed an enormous
distance. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being, for the moment, centred in the wish to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
in the room.

<p/>Morris bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) head and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``When you are quiet, you
are perfection,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but when you are violent, you are not in
character.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Catherine's wish that there should be no violence about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) save
the beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not help; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on, as
gently as possible, <div class="bookquote">``Will you promise to come to-morrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I said Saturday!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris answered, smiling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) tried a frown at one
moment, a smile at another; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) wit's end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Saturday too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered, trying to smile. <div class="bookquote">``But to-morrow
first.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was going to the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) quickly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shoulder against it; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would do
anything to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am prevented from coming to-morrow, you will say I have deceived
you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be prevented? You can come if you will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a busy man--I am not a dangler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris sternly.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) voice was so hard and unnatural that, with a helpless look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) quickly laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hand on the door-knob. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) were absolutely running away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But in an instant
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) again, and murmuring in a tone none the less
penetrating for being low, <div class="bookquote">``Morris, you are going to leave me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for a little while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Till you are reasonable again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never be reasonable in that way!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tried to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
longer; it was almost a struggle. <div class="bookquote">``Think of what I have done!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke
out. <div class="bookquote">``Morris, I have given up everything!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have everything back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't say that if you didn't mean something. What is it?--what
has happened?--what have I done?--what has changed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will write to you--that is better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris stammered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you won't come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried, bursting into tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``don't believe that I promise you that you
shall see me again!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) managed to get away and to close the door
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>).




<p/>XXX


<p/>IT was almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) last outbreak of passive grief; at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never
indulged in another that the world knew anything about. But this one was
long and terrible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) flung herself on the sofa and gave herself up to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly knew what had happened; ostensibly she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had only
had a difference with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lover, as other girls had had before, and the
thing was not only not a rupture, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was under no obligation to
regard it even as a menace. Nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt a wound, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
had not dealt it; it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that a mask had suddenly fallen from
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had wished to get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had been angry and
cruel, and said strange things, with strange looks. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was smothered
and stunned; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head in the cushions, sobbing and talking to
herself. But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised herself, with the fear that either her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father or Mrs. Penniman would come in; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat there, staring
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), while the room grew darker. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said to herself that perhaps
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would come back to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not meant what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
listened for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ring at the door, trying to believe that this was
probable. A long time passed, but Morris remained absent; the shadows
gathered; the evening settled down on the meagre elegance of the light,
clear-coloured room; the fire went out. When it had grown dark,
Catherine went to the window and looked out; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood there for half an
hour, on the mere chance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would come up the steps. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
turned away, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at the
window looking out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped a moment at the bottom of the white
steps, and gravely, with an air of exaggerated courtesy, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The gesture was so incongruous to the condition she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in, this
stately tribute of respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so
out of place, that the thing gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a kind of horror, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried
away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had given Morris up.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had to show herself half an hour later, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sustained at
table by the immensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) desire that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father should not perceive
that anything had happened. This was a great help to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) afterwards, and
it served her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) -LRB-though never as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) supposed-RRB- from the first. On
this occasion Dr. Sloper was rather talkative. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told a great many
stories about a wonderful poodle that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had seen at the house of an old
lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) visited professionally. Catherine not only tried to appear
to listen to the anecdotes of the poodle, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) endeavoured to interest
herself in them, so as not to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scene with Morris. That
perhaps was an hallucination; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was mistaken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was jealous; people
didn't change like that from one day to another. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had had doubts before--strange suspicions, that were at once vague and
acute--and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had been different ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) return from Europe:
whereupon she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tried again to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, who told a story so
remarkably well. Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own room; it was
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) strength to undertake to spend the evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt. All
the evening, alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) questioned herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trouble was terrible;
but was it a thing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination, engendered by an extravagant
sensibility, or did it represent a clear-cut reality, and had the worst
that was possible actually come to pass? Mrs. Penniman, with a degree of
tact that was as unusual as it was commendable, took the line of leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) alone. The truth is, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) suspicions having been aroused, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
indulged a desire, natural to a timid person, that the explosion should
be localised. So long as the air still vibrated she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) kept out of the way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) passed and repassed Catherine's door several times in the course of
the evening, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) expected to hear a plaintive moan behind it. But
the room remained perfectly still; and accordingly, the last thing before
retiring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) own couch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) applied for admittance. Catherine was
sitting up, and had a book that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pretended to be reading. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no
wish to go to bed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no expectation of sleeping. After Mrs.
Penniman had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sat up half the night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
visitor no inducement to remain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aunt came stealing in very gently,
and approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) with great solemnity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are in trouble, my dear. Can I do anything to help
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not in any trouble whatever, and do not need any help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said
Catherine, fibbing roundly, and proving thereby that not only our faults,
but our most involuntary misfortunes, tend to corrupt our morals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has nothing happened to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very sure, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And can I really do nothing for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, aunt, but kindly leave me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had been afraid of too warm a welcome before,
was now disappointed at so cold a one; and in relating afterwards, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
did to many persons, and with considerable variations of detail, the
history of the termination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's engagement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was usually
careful to mention that the young lady, on a certain occasion, had
<div class="bookquote">``hustled''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out of the room. It was characteristic of Mrs. Penniman
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) related this fact, not in the least out of malignity to
Catherine, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very sufficiently pitied, but simply from a natural
disposition to embellish any subject that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) touched.

<p/>Catherine, as I have said, sat up half the night, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still
expected to hear Morris Townsend ring at the door. On the morrow this
expectation was less unreasonable; but it was not gratified by the
reappearance of the young man. Neither had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) written; there was not a
word of explanation or reassurance. Fortunately for Catherine she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
take refuge from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) excitement, which had now become intense, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
determination that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father should see nothing of it. How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father we shall have occasion to learn; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) innocent
arts were of little avail before a person of the rare perspicacity of
Mrs. Penniman. This lady easily saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was agitated, and if there
was any agitation going forward, Mrs. Penniman was not a person to
forfeit her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) natural share in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) returned to the charge the next
evening, and requested her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece to lean upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)--to unburden her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) heart.
Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) should be able to explain certain things that now seemed
dark, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) knew more about than Catherine supposed. If Catherine
had been frigid the night before, to-day she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was haughty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are completely mistaken, and I have not the least idea what you
mean. I don't know what you are trying to fasten on me, and I have never
had less need of any one's explanations in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>In this way the girl delivered herself, and from hour to hour kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
aunt at bay. From hour to hour Mrs. Penniman's curiosity grew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) little finger to know what Morris had said and done,
what tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had taken, what pretext he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had found. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),
naturally, to request an interview; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) received, as naturally, no
answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) petition. Morris was not in a writing mood; for Catherine
had addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) two short notes which met with no acknowledgment.
These notes were so brief that I may give them entire. <div class="bookquote">``Won't you give
me some sign that you didn't mean to be so cruel as you seemed on
Tuesday?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--that was the first; the other was a little longer. <div class="bookquote">``If I was
unreasonable or suspicious on Tuesday--if I annoyed you or troubled you in
any way--I beg your forgiveness, and I promise never again to be so
foolish. I am punished enough, and I don't understand. Dear Morris, you
are killing me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>These notes were despatched on the Friday and Saturday;
but Saturday and Sunday passed without bringing the poor girl the
satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) desired. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) punishment accumulated; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued to
bear it, however, with a good deal of superficial fortitude. On Saturday
morning the Doctor, who had been watching in silence, spoke to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister
Lavinia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing has happened--the scoundrel has backed out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Penniman, who had bethought herself what she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) should
say to Catherine, but was not provided with a line of defence against her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother, so that indignant negation was the only weapon in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) has begged for a reprieve, then, if you like that better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to make you very happy that your daughter's affections have
been trifled with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor; ```for I had foretold it! It's a great
pleasure to be in the right.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your pleasures make one shudder!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) sister exclaimed.

<p/>Catherine went rigidly through her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) usual occupations; that is, up to the
point of going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt to church on Sunday morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) generally
went to afternoon service as well; but on this occasion her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) courage
faltered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) begged of Mrs. Penniman to go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you have a secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with great
significance, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) rather grimly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I have, I shall keep it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered, turning away.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman started for church; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) stopped
and turned back, and before twenty minutes had elapsed she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) re-entered the
house, looked into the empty parlours, and then went upstairs and knocked
at Catherine's door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got no answer; Catherine was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room,
and Mrs. Penniman presently ascertained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not in the house.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has fled!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lavinia/Aunt Lavinia</b></font>)</div>Lavinia cried, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) hands
with admiration and envy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lavinia</b></font>) soon perceived that Catherine had
taken nothing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) personal property in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room was
intact--and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) jumped at the hypothesis that the girl had gone
forth, not in tenderness, but in resentment. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has followed him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) own door--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has burst upon him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) own apartment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>It was in
these terms that Mrs. Penniman depicted to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece's errand,
which, viewed in this light, gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sense of the picturesque only
a shade less strongly than the idea of a clandestine marriage. To visit
one's lover, with tears and reproaches, at his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own residence, was an
image so agreeable to Mrs. Penniman's mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt a sort of
æsthetic disappointment at its lacking, in this case, the harmonious
accompaniments of darkness and storm. A quiet Sunday afternoon appeared
an inadequate setting for it; and, indeed, Mrs. Penniman was quite out of
humour with the conditions of the time, which passed very slowly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
sat in the front parlour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cashmere shawl, awaiting
Catherine's return.

<p/>This event at last took place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--at the window--mount the
steps, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went to await her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in the hall, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pounced upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had entered the house, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into the parlour,
closing the door with solemnity. Catherine was flushed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye was
bright. Mrs. Penniman hardly knew what to think.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I venture to ask where you have been?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been to take a walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had gone to
church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did go to church; but the service was shorter than usual. And pray,
where did you walk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your ignorance is most extraordinary! Dear Catherine, you can trust
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to trust you with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With your secret--your sorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no sorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine fiercely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My poor child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman insisted, <div class="bookquote">``you can't deceive me. I know
everything. I have been requested to--a--to converse with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to converse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will relieve you. Don't you know Shakespeare's lines?--`the grief
that does not speak!' My dear girl, it is better as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is better?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was really too perverse. A certain amount of perversity was to be
allowed for in a young lady whose lover had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) over; but not such
an amount as would prove inconvenient to his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) apologists. <div class="bookquote">``That you
should be reasonable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, with some sternness. <div class="bookquote">``That
you should take counsel of worldly prudence, and submit to practical
considerations. That you should agree to--a--separate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had been ice up to this moment, but at this word she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) flamed up.
<div class="bookquote">``Separate? What do you know about our separating?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) head with a sadness in which there was almost a
sense of injury. <div class="bookquote">``Your pride is my pride, and your susceptibilities are
mine. I see your side perfectly, but I also'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) smiled with
melancholy suggestiveness--<div class="bookquote">``I also see the situation as a whole!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This suggestiveness was lost upon Catherine, who repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) violent
inquiry. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you talk about separation; what do you know about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must study resignation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, hesitating, but
sententious at a venture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Resignation to what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a change of--of our plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My plans have not changed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but Mr. Townsend's have,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt answered very gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an imperious brevity in the tone of this inquiry, against which
Mrs. Penniman felt bound to protest; the information with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had
undertaken to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece was, after all, a favour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had tried
sharpness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had tried sternness: but neither would do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was
shocked at the girl's obstinacy. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) hasn't
told you! ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) turned away.

<p/>Catherine watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a moment in silence; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried after her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reached the door. <div class="bookquote">``Told me what? What do you
mean? What are you hinting at and threatening me with?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it broken off?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Penniman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My engagement? Not in the least!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon in that case. I have spoken too soon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too soon! Soon or late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine broke out, <div class="bookquote">``you speak foolishly and
cruelly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened between you, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, struck by the
sincerity of this cry. <div class="bookquote">``For something certainly has happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing has happened but that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) more and more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman was silent an instant. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's the reason you
went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) this afternoon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine flushed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been struck. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!
But that's my own business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, then; we won't talk about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman moved
towards the door again. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was stopped by a sudden imploring cry
from the girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Lavinia, _where_ has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you admit, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has gone away? Didn't they know at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had left town. I asked no more questions; I was ashamed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, simply enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You needn't have taken so compromising a step if you had had a little
more confidence in me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman observed, with a good deal of
grandeur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to New Orleans?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine went on irrelevantly.

<p/>It was the first time Mrs. Penniman had heard of New Orleans in this
connexion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was averse to letting Catherine know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in
the dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attempted to strike an illumination from the instructions
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had received from Morris. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when a
separation has been agreed upon, the farther he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) goes away the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agreed upon? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) agreed upon it with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>A consummate sense of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt's meddlesome folly had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) during the last five
minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sickened at the thought that Mrs. Penniman had been
let loose, as it were, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) certainly has sometimes advised with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it you, then, that have changed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) so unnatural?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine cried. <div class="bookquote">``Is it you that have worked on him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and taken him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) from
me? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) doesn't belong to you, and I don't see how you have anything to
do with what is between us! Is it you that have made this plot and told
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to leave me? How could you be so wicked, so cruel? What have I ever
done to you; why can't you leave me alone? I was afraid you would spoil
everything; for you _do_ spoil everything you touch; I was afraid of you
all the time we were abroad; I had no rest when I thought that you were
always talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine went on with growing vehemence,
pouring out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bitterness and in the clairvoyance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) passion
-LRB-which suddenly, jumping all processes, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) judge her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt finally
and without appeal-RRB- the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman was scared and bewildered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) saw no prospect of
introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) little account of the purity of Morris's motives. <div class="bookquote">``You
are a most ungrateful girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Do you scold me for talking
with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)? I am sure we never talked of anything but you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and that was the way you worried him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); you made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tired of my very
name! I wish you had never spoken of me to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); I never asked your
help!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure if it hadn't been for me he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would never have come to the
house, and you would never have known what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Penniman rejoined, with a good deal of justice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never had come to the house, and that I never had known it!
That's better than this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said poor Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a very ungrateful girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>Aunt Lavinia repeated.

<p/>Catherine's outbreak of anger and the sense of wrong gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), while they
lasted, the satisfaction that comes from all assertion of force; they
hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) along, and there is always a sort of pleasure in cleaving the
air. But at the bottom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hated to be violent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was conscious of
no aptitude for organised resentment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) calmed herself with a great
effort, but with great rapidity, and walked about the room a few moments,
trying to say to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt had meant everything for the best.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not succeed in saying it with much conviction, but after a little
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was able to speak quietly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not ungrateful, but I am very unhappy. It's hard to be grateful
for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Will you please tell me where he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea; I am not in secret correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Penniman wished indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) were, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) might let him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
know how Catherine abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it a plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), then, to break off--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>By this time Catherine had
become completely quiet.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman began again to have a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) chance for explaining.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shrank--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shrank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lacked courage, but it was the
courage to injure you! He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) couldn't bear to bring down on you your
father's curse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine listened to this with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, and
continued to gaze at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for some time afterwards. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tell you to
say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told me to say many things--all so delicate, so discriminating. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) told me to tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hoped you wouldn't despise him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``And will he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stay away
for ever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for ever is a long time. Your father, perhaps, won't live for
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you appreciate--you understand--even though your heart bleeds,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``You doubtless think him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too scrupulous. So do I,
but I respect his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) scruples. What he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asks of you is that you should do
the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was still gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke at last, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had not heard or not understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It has been a regular plan, then.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has broken it off deliberately; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has given me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the present, dear Catherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has put it off only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has left me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you _me_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Penniman, with much expression.

<p/>Catherine shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) left the
room.




<p/>XXXI


<p/>THOUGH she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had forced herself to be calm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preferred practising this
virtue in private, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forbore to show herself at tea--a repast which,
on Sundays, at six o’clock, took the place of dinner. Dr. Sloper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sister sat face to face, but Mrs. Penniman never met her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother's eye.
Late in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but without Catherine, to their
sister Almond's, where, between the two ladies, Catherine's unhappy
situation was discussed with a frankness that was conditioned by a good
deal of mysterious reticence on Mrs. Penniman's part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought
to be horsewhipped all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Penniman, who was shocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sister's coarseness, replied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been actuated by the noblest of motives--the desire not to
impoverish Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very happy that Catherine is not to be impoverished--but I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
may never have a penny too much! And what does the poor girl say to
_you_?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Almond asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says I have a genius for consolation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman.

<p/>This was the account of the matter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) gave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sister, and it
was perhaps with the consciousness of genius that, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) return that
evening to Washington Square, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) again presented herself for admittance
at Catherine's door. Catherine came and opened it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was apparently
very quiet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only want to give you a little word of advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If your
father asks you, say that everything is going on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine stood there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand on the knob looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, but
not asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to come in. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked me just now, on our way home from your Aunt
Elizabeth's. I explained the whole thing to your Aunt Elizabeth. I said
to your father I know nothing about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will ask me when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees--when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees--?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>But here
Catherine stopped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The more he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sees the more disagreeable he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shall see as little as possible!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) you are to be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine softly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) closed the door upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not have said this two days later--for instance, on Tuesday,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at last received a letter from Morris Townsend. It was an
epistle of considerable length, measuring five large square pages, and
written at Philadelphia. It was an explanatory document, and it
explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations
that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent <div class="bookquote">``professional''
 (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>absence to try and banish from his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) mind the image of one whose path he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
had crossed only to scatter it with ruins. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) ventured to expect but
partial success in this attempt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) could promise her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that, whatever
his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) failure, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would never again interpose between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) generous heart
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brilliant prospects and filial duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) closed with an
intimation that his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) professional pursuits might compel him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) to travel for
some months, and with the hope that when they should each have
accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective
positions--even should this result not be reached for years--they should
meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims
of a great social law. That her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life should be peaceful and happy was
the dearest wish of him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) who ventured still to subscribe himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) most
obedient servant. The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who
kept it for many years after this, was able, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sense of the
bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less
acute, to admire its grace of expression. At present, for a long time
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) received it, all she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the determination,
daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suffered a week to elapse, and then one day, in the morning, at an
hour at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rarely saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) strolled into the back parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had watched his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sitting with some
work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came and stood in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going out, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had on
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat and was drawing on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gloves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't seem to me that you are treating me just now with all the
consideration I deserve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said in a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have apparently quite banished from your mind the request I made you
at Liverpool, before we sailed; the request that you would notify me in
advance before leaving my house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not left your house!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you intend to leave it, and by what you gave me to understand, your
departure must be impending. In fact, though you are still here in body,
you are already absent in spirit. Your mind has taken up its residence
with your prospective husband, and you might quite as well be lodged
under the conjugal roof, for all the benefit we get from your society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try and be more cheerful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly ought to be cheerful, you ask a great deal if you are not.
To the pleasure of marrying a brilliant young man, you add that of having
your own way; you strike me as a very lucky young lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine got up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was suffocating. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work,
deliberately and correctly, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) burning face upon it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father
stood where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had planted himself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
smoothed and buttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gloves, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
hips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a convenience to me to know when I may expect to have an
empty house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``When you go, your aunt marches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at last, with a long silent gaze, which, in spite of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pride and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution, uttered part of the appeal she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had tried
not to make. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's cold grey eye sounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) insisted
on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to-morrow? Is it next week, or the week after?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

perplexity by saying to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter simply
misrepresented--justifiably, if one would? but nevertheless
misrepresented--the facts; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eased off his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) disappointment, which was
that of a man losing a chance for a little triumph that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had rather
counted on, by a few words that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uttered aloud.

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor had his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) revenge, after all.




<p/>XXXII


<p/>OUR story has hitherto moved with very short steps, but as it approaches
its termination it must take a long stride. As time went on, it might
have appeared to the Doctor that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's account of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) rupture
with Morris Townsend, mere bravado as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had deemed it, was in some
degree justified by the sequel. Morris remained as rigidly and
unremittingly absent as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had died of a broken heart, and Catherine
had apparently buried the memory of this fruitless episode as deep as if
it had terminated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own choice. We know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been deeply
and incurably wounded, but the Doctor had no means of knowing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
certainly curious about it, and would have given a good deal to discover
the exact truth; but it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) punishment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) never knew--his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
punishment, I mean, for the abuse of sarcasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
daughter. There was a good deal of effective sarcasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
in the dark, and the rest of the world conspired with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), in this sense,
to be sarcastic. Mrs. Penniman told him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) nothing, partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) never
questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) made too light of Mrs. Penniman for that--and partly
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) flattered herself that a tormenting reserve, and a serene
profession of ignorance, would avenge her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) theory that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had
meddled in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) went two or three times to see Mrs.
Montgomery, but Mrs. Montgomery had nothing to impart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) simply knew
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Montgomery</b></font>) brother's engagement was broken off, and now that Miss Sloper
was out of danger she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) preferred not to bear witness in any way against
Morris. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) had done so before--however unwillingly--because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) was sorry
for Miss Sloper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) was not sorry for Miss Sloper now--not at all
sorry. Morris had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) nothing about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) relations with Miss Sloper
at the time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) nothing since. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was always away, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) very seldom wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sloper</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had gone to California.
Mrs. Almond had, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) sister's phrase, <div class="bookquote">``taken up''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Catherine violently
since the recent catastrophe; but though the girl was very grateful to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) revealed no secrets, and the good lady could
give the Doctor no satisfaction. Even, however, had she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been able to
narrate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) the private history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's unhappy love affair,
it would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a certain comfort to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) in ignorance; for
Mrs. Almond was at this time not altogether in sympathy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) brother.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) had guessed for herself that Catherine had been cruelly jilted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
knew nothing from Mrs. Penniman, for Mrs. Penniman had not ventured to
lay the famous explanation of Morris's motives before Mrs. Almond, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Almond</b></font>) had thought it good enough for Catherine--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother too consistently indifferent to what the poor creature must have
suffered and must still be suffering. Dr. Sloper had his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) theory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
rarely altered his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) theories. The marriage would have been an abominable
one, and the girl had had a blessed escape. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not to be pitied for
that, and to pretend to condole with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have been to make
concessions to the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had ever had a right to think of Morris.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I put my foot on this idea from the first, and I keep it there now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see anything cruel in that; one can't keep it
there too long.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>To this Mrs. Almond more than once replied that if
Catherine had got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) incongruous lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) deserved the credit
of it, and that to bring herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's enlightened view of the
matter must have cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) an effort that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was bound to appreciate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am by no means sure she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>the Doctor said. <div class="bookquote">``There
is not the smallest probability that, after having been as obstinate as a
mule for two years, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly became amenable to reason. It is
infinitely more probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the more reason you should be gentle with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I _am_ gentle with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But I can't do the pathetic; I can't pump up
tears, to look graceful, over the most fortunate thing that ever happened
to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have no sympathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond; <div class="bookquote">``that was never your strong
point. You have only to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to see that, right or wrong, and
whether the rupture came from herself or from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor little heart
is grievously bruised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handling bruises--and even dropping tears on them--doesn't make them any
better! My business is to see she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets no more knocks, and that I shall
carefully attend to. But I don't at all recognise your description of
Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doesn't strike me in the least as a young woman going
about in search of a moral poultice. In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seems to me much
better than while the fellow was hanging about. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is perfectly
comfortable and blooming; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eats and sleeps, takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual exercise,
and overloads herself, as usual, with finery. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is always knitting
some purse or embroidering some handkerchief, and it seems to me she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
turns these articles out about as fast as ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hasn't much to say;
but when had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anything to say? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little dance, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
is sitting down to rest. I suspect that, on the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enjoys it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enjoys it as people enjoy getting rid of a leg that has been
crushed. The state of mind after amputation is doubtless one of
comparative repose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If your leg is a metaphor for young Townsend, I can assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has
never been crushed. Crushed? Not he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is alive and perfectly intact,
and that's why I am not satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you have liked to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much. I think it is quite possible that it is all a blind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A blind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An arrangement between them. _Il fait le mort_, as they say in France;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is looking out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) eye. You can depend upon it
he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has not burned his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) ships; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has kept one to come back in. When I am
dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will set sail again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is interesting to know that you accuse your only daughter of being
the vilest of hypocrites,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Almond</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Almond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see what difference her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) being my only daughter makes. It is
better to accuse one than a dozen. But I don't accuse any one. There is
not the smallest hypocrisy about Catherine, and I deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even
pretends to be miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor's idea that the thing was a <div class="bookquote">``blind''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>had its intermissions and
revivals; but it may be said on the whole to have increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) grew
older; together with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) impression of Catherine's blooming and
comfortable condition. Naturally, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not found grounds for
viewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as a lovelorn maiden during the year or two that followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
great trouble, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) found none at a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had completely recovered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) self-possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was obliged to recognise the fact that if the
two young people were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to get out of the way, they were at
least waiting very patiently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had heard from time to time that Morris
was in New York; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) never remained there long, and, to the best of
the Doctor's belief, had no communication with Catherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was sure
they never met, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had reason to suspect that Morris never wrote to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). After the letter that has been mentioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) twice
again, at considerable intervals; but on none of these occasions did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
write herself. On the other hand, as the Doctor observed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) averted
herself rigidly from the idea of marrying other people. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
opportunities for doing so were not numerous, but they occurred often
enough to test her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) disposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) refused a widower, a man with a
genial temperament, a handsome fortune, and three little girls -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very fond of children, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own with
some confidence-RRB-; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned a deaf ear to the solicitations of a
clever young lawyer, who, with the prospect of a great practice, and the
reputation of a most agreeable man, had had the shrewdness, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came
to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a wife, to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better
than several younger and prettier girls. Mr. Macalister, the widower,
had desired to make a marriage of reason, and had chosen Catherine for
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) supposed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) latent matronly qualities; but John Ludlow,
who was a year the girl's junior, and spoken of always as a young man who
might have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``pick,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>was seriously in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Catherine,
however, would never look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made it plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too often. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) afterwards consoled himself,
and married a very different person, little Miss Sturtevant, whose
attractions were obvious to the dullest comprehension. Catherine, at the
time of these events, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thirtieth year well behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
had quite taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place as an old maid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father would have
preferred she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should marry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
not be too fastidious. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to see you an honest man's wife
before I die,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. This was after John Ludlow had been compelled to
give it up, though the Doctor had advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to persevere. The Doctor
exercised no further pressure, and had the credit of not <div class="bookquote">``worrying''  (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div>at
all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) daughter's singleness. In fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) worried rather more than
appeared, and there were considerable periods during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt sure
that Morris Townsend was hidden behind some door. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not, why
doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) asked himself. <div class="bookquote">``Limited as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) intelligence may
be, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must understand perfectly well that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is made to do the usual
thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine, however, became an admirable old maid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) formed
habits, regulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) days upon a system of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, interested herself
in charitable institutions, asylums, hospitals, and aid societies; and
went generally, with an even and noiseless step, about the rigid business
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life. This life had, however, a secret history as well as a
public one--if I may talk of the public history of a mature and diffident
spinster for whom publicity had always a combination of terrors. From
her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) own point of view the great facts of her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) career were that Morris
Townsend had trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) affection, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) father had broken
its spring. Nothing could ever alter these facts; they were always
there, like her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) name, her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) age, her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) plain face. Nothing could ever undo
the wrong or cure the pain that Morris had inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>), and nothing
could ever make her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) feel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) father as she (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) younger
years. There was something dead in her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>spinster</b></font>) duty was to try and
fill the void. Catherine recognised this duty to the utmost; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a
great disapproval of brooding and moping. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had, of course, no faculty
for quenching memory in dissipation; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mingled freely in the usual
gaieties of the town, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) became at last an inevitable figure at all
respectable entertainments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was greatly liked, and as time went on
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the younger portion of
society. Young girls were apt to confide to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) their love affairs
-LRB-which they never did to Mrs. Penniman-RRB-, and young men to be fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
without knowing why. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) developed a few harmless eccentricities; her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
habits, once formed, were rather stiffly maintained; her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) opinions, on all
moral and social matters, were extremely conservative; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was
forty she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was regarded as an old-fashioned person, and an authority on
customs that had passed away. Mrs. Penniman, in comparison, was quite a
girlish figure; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) grew younger as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) advanced in life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) lost none
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) relish for beauty and mystery, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had little opportunity to
exercise it. With Catherine's later wooers she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) failed to establish
relations as intimate as those which had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so many interesting
hours in the society of Morris Townsend. These gentlemen had an
indefinable mistrust of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) good offices, and they never talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
about Catherine's charms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ringlets, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) buckles and bangles,
glistened more brightly with each succeeding year, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained quite
the same officious and imaginative Mrs. Penniman, and the odd mixture of
impetuosity and circumspection, that we have hitherto known. As regards
one point, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) circumspection prevailed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) must be given
due credit for it. For upwards of seventeen years she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) never mentioned
Morris Townsend's name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece. Catherine was grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), but
this consistent silence, so little in accord with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt's character,
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a certain alarm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could never wholly rid herself of a
suspicion that Mrs. Penniman sometimes had news of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).




<p/>XXXIII


<p/>LITTLE by little Dr. Sloper had retired from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) visited
only those patients in whose symptoms he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) recognised a certain
originality. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went again to Europe, and remained two years; Catherine
went with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and on this occasion Mrs. Penniman was of the party.
Europe apparently had few surprises for Mrs. Penniman, who frequently
remarked, in the most romantic sites--<div class="bookquote">``You know I am very familiar with
all this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>It should be added that such remarks were usually not
addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother, or yet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece, but to fellow-tourists who
happened to be at hand, or even to the cicerone or the goat-herd in the
foreground.

<p/>One day, after his (<font color='blue'><b>cicerone</b></font>) return from Europe, the Doctor said something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
daughter that made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) start--it seemed to come from so far out of the
past.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like you to promise me something before I die.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you talk about your dying?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I am sixty-eight years old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will live a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall! But some day I shall take a bad cold, and then it will
not matter much what any one hopes. That will be the manner of my exit,
and when it takes place, remember I told you so. Promise me not to marry
Morris Townsend after I am gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This was what made Catherine start, as I have said; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) start was a
silent one, and for some moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said nothing. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you speak of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You challenge everything I say. I speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)'s a topic,
like any other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)'s to be seen, like any one else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is still
looking for a wife--having had one and got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I don't know by
what means. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has lately been in New York, and at your cousin Marian's
house; your Aunt Elizabeth saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They neither of them told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's their merit; it's not yours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has grown fat and bald, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
has not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) fortune. But I can't trust those facts alone to steel
your heart against him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>), and that's why I ask you to promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fat and bald'' (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>: these words presented a strange image to Catherine's
mind, out of which the memory of the most beautiful young man in the
world had never faded. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I
very seldom think of Mr. Townsend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be very easy for you to go on, then. Promise me, after my
death, to do the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Again, for some moments, Catherine was silent; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's request
deeply amazed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); it opened an old wound and made it ache afresh. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't think I can promise that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a great satisfaction,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand. I can't promise that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>The Doctor was silent a minute. <div class="bookquote">``I ask you for a particular reason. I
am altering my will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>This reason failed to strike Catherine; and indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scarcely
understood it. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings were merged in the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was
trying to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) years before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had suffered
from it then; and now all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) experience, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquired tranquillity
and rigidity, protested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been so humble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) youth that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could now afford to have a little pride, and there was something in this
request, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's thinking himself so free to make it, that
seemed an injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dignity. Poor Catherine's dignity was not
aggressive; it never sat in state; but if you pushed far enough you could
find it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had pushed very far.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) simply repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obstinate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please explain, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``And I can't promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father explained, <div class="bookquote">``I had no idea how obstinate you
are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was obstinate, and it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a certain joy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was now a middle-aged woman.

<p/>About a year after this, the accident that the Doctor had spoken of
occurred; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) took a violent cold. Driving out to Bloomingdale one April
day to see a patient of unsound mind, who was confined in a private
asylum for the insane, and whose family greatly desired a medical opinion
from an eminent source, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was caught in a spring shower, and being in a
buggy, without a hood, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) found himself soaked to the skin. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) came home
with an ominous chill, and on the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was seriously ill. <div class="bookquote">``It is
congestion of the lungs,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said to Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I shall need very good
nursing. It will make no difference, for I shall not recover; but I wish
everything to be done, to the smallest detail, as if I should. I hate an
ill-conducted sick-room; and you will be so good as to nurse me on the
hypothesis that I shall get well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) which of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
fellow-physicians to send for, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a multitude of minute
directions; it was quite on the optimistic hypothesis that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nursed
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had never been wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was not wrong now.
He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was touching his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) seventieth year, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had a very
well-tempered constitution, his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) hold upon life had lost its firmness. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
died after three weeks' illness, during which Mrs. Penniman, as well as
his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) daughter, had been assiduous at his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) bedside.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) will being opened after a decent interval, it was found to consist
of two portions. The first of these dated from ten years back, and
consisted of a series of dispositions by which he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) left the great mass of
property to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) daughter, with becoming legacies to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) two sisters. The
second was a codicil, of recent origin, maintaining the annuities to Mrs.
Penniman and Mrs. Almond, but reducing Catherine's share to a fifth of
what he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had first bequeathed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is amply provided for from her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
mother's side,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the document ran, <div class="bookquote">``never having spent more than a
fraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) income from this source; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) fortune is already
more than sufficient to attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
has given me reason to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) persists in regarding as an
interesting class.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sloper/DR. SLOPER</b></font>)</div>The large remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) property, therefore, Dr.
Sloper had divided into seven unequal parts, which he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) left, as
endowments, to as many different hospitals and schools of medicine, in
various cities of the Union.

<p/>To Mrs. Penniman it seemed monstrous that a man should play such tricks
with other people's money; for after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death, of course, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said,
it was other people's. <div class="bookquote">``Of course, you will dispute the will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
remarked, fatuously, to Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered, <div class="bookquote">``I like it very much. Only I wish it had
been expressed a little differently!''




 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>XXXIV


<p/>IT was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habit to remain in town very late in the summer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preferred
the house in Washington Square to any other habitation whatever, and it
was under protest that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) used to go to the seaside for the month of
August. At the sea she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) month at an hotel. The year that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
father died she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) intermitted this custom altogether, not thinking it
consistent with deep mourning; and the year after that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) put off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
departure till so late that the middle of August found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still in the
heated solitude of Washington Square. Mrs. Penniman, who was fond of a
change, was usually eager for a visit to the country; but this year she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
appeared quite content with such rural impressions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) could gather,
at the parlour window, from the ailantus-trees behind the wooden paling.
The peculiar fragrance of this vegetation used to diffuse itself in the
evening air, and Mrs. Penniman, on the warm nights of July, often sat at
the open window and inhaled it. This was a happy moment for Mrs.
Penniman; after the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brother she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt more free to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
impulses. A vague oppression had disappeared from her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
enjoyed a sense of freedom of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had not been conscious since the
memorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor went abroad with Catherine
and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at home to entertain Morris Townsend. The year that had
elapsed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother's death reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--of that happy time,
because, although Catherine, in growing older, had become a person to be
reckoned with, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) society was a very different thing, as Mrs.
Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold water. The elder lady hardly
knew what use to make of this larger margin of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat and
looked at it very much as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had often sat, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poised needle in
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tapestry frame. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a confident hope, however,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rich impulses, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talent for embroidery, would still find their
application, and this confidence was justified before many months had
elapsed.

<p/>Catherine continued to live in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's house in spite of its being
represented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that a maiden lady of quiet habits might find a more
convenient abode in one of the smaller dwellings, with brown stone
fronts, which had at this time begun to adorn the transverse
thoroughfares in the upper part of the town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked the earlier
structure--it had begun by this time to be called an <div class="bookquote">``old''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>house--and
proposed to herself to end her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) days in it. If it was too large for a
pair of unpretending gentlewomen, this was better than the opposite
fault; for Catherine had no desire to find herself in closer quarters
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expected to spend the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life in Washington
Square, and to enjoy Mrs. Penniman's society for the whole of this
period; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had a conviction that, long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) might live, her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) aunt
would live at least as long, and always retain her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) brilliancy and
activity. Mrs. Penniman suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) the idea of a rich vitality.

<p/>On one of those warm evenings in July of which mention has been made, the
two ladies sat together at an open window, looking out on the quiet
Square. It was too hot for lighted lamps, for reading, or for work; it
might have appeared too hot even for conversation, Mrs. Penniman having
long been speechless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sat forward in the window, half on the
balcony, humming a little song. Catherine was within the room, in a low
rocking-chair, dressed in white, and slowly using a large palmetto fan.
It was in this way, at this season, that the aunt and niece, after they
had had tea, habitually spent their evenings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman at last, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to say something
that will surprise you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine answered; <div class="bookquote">``I like surprises. And it is so quiet
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I have seen Morris Townsend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>If Catherine was surprised, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) checked the expression of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave
neither a start nor an exclamation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained, indeed, for some
moments intensely still, and this may very well have been a symptom of
emotion. <div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is a great deal changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would like very much to
see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you would say that. But you don't seem surprised!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am--very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) at Marian's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) goes to Marian's, and
they are so afraid you will meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) there. It's my belief that that's
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) goes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wants so much to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine made no response
to this, and Mrs. Penniman went on. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) at first; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is
so remarkably changed. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) knew me in a minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) says I am not in
the least changed. You know how polite he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) always was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) was coming
away when I came, and we walked a little distance together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is still
very handsome, only, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) looks older, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is not so--so
animated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) used to be. There was a touch of sadness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>); but
there was a touch of sadness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) before--especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) went
away. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has not been very successful--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has never got
thoroughly established. I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is sufficiently plodding, and
that, after all, is what succeeds in this world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Penniman had not
mentioned Morris Townsend's name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) niece for upwards of the fifth of
a century; but now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had broken the spell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) seemed to wish to
make up for lost time, as if there had been a sort of exhilaration in
hearing herself talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) proceeded, however, with considerable
caution, pausing occasionally to let Catherine give some sign. Catherine
gave no other sign than to stop the rocking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair and the swaying
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fan; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat motionless and silent. <div class="bookquote">``It was on Tuesday last,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman, <div class="bookquote">``and I have been hesitating ever since about telling
you. I didn't know how you might like it. At last I thought that it was
so long ago that you would probably not have any particular feeling. I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) again, after meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) at Marian's. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) in the street,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) went a few steps with me. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said was about you;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) asked ever so many questions. Marian didn't want me to speak to you;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) didn't want you to know that they receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) I was sure
that after all these years you couldn't have any feeling about that; you
couldn't grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) the hospitality of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) own cousin's house. I said
you would be bitter indeed if you did that. Marian has the most
extraordinary ideas about what happened between you; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) seems to think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) behaved in some very unusual manner. I took the liberty of reminding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marian</b></font>) of the real facts, and placing the story in its true light. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)_ has
no bitterness, Catherine, I can assure you; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) might be excused for
it, for things have not gone well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has been all over the
world, and tried to establish himself everywhere; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) evil star was
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). It is most interesting to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) evil star.
Everything failed; everything but his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)--you know, you remember--his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) proud,
high spirit. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) married some lady somewhere in Europe. You
know they marry in such a peculiar matter-of-course way in Europe; a
marriage of reason they call it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) died soon afterwards; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said to
me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only flitted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has not been in New York for
ten years; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) came back a few days ago. The first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) did was to
ask me about you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) had heard you had never married; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) seemed very
much interested about that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) said you had been the real romance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion to proceed from point to point, and
pause to pause, without interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes on the
ground and listened. But the last phrase I have quoted was followed by a
pause of peculiar significance, and then, at last, Catherine spoke. It
will be observed that before doing so she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had received a good deal of
information about Morris Townsend. <div class="bookquote">``Please say no more; please don't
follow up that subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doesn't it interest you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Penniman, with a certain timorous
archness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It pains me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you would say that. But don't you think you could get used
to it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wants so much to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't, Aunt Lavinia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seat.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved quickly away, and went to the other window, which stood open to
the balcony; and here, in the embrasure, concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt by the
white curtains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained a long time, looking out into the warm
darkness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had had a great shock; it was as if the gulf of the past
had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure had risen out of it. There
were some things she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had got over, some feelings that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had thought of as dead; but apparently there was a certain vitality in
them still. Mrs. Penniman had made them stir themselves. It was but a
momentary agitation, Catherine said to herself; it would presently pass
away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was trembling, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart was beating so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
feel it; but this also would subside. Then, suddenly, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) waited
for a return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) calmness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) burst into tears. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tears flowed
very silently, so that Mrs. Penniman had no observation of them. It was
perhaps, however, because Mrs. Penniman suspected them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said no
more that evening about Morris Townsend.




<p/>XXXV


<p/>HER refreshed attention to this gentleman had not those limits of which
Catherine desired, for herself, to be conscious; it lasted long enough to
enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to wait another week before speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again. It was
under the same circumstances that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) once more attacked the subject.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) niece in the evening; only on this
occasion, as the night was not so warm, the lamp had been lighted, and
Catherine had placed herself near it with a morsel of fancy-work. Mrs.
Penniman went and sat alone for half an hour on the balcony; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
came in, moving vaguely about the room. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) sank into a seat
near Catherine, with clasped hands, and a little look of excitement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about _him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)_?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Catherine looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Who is _he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)_?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) whom you once loved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not be angry, but I shall not like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) sent you a message,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Penniman. <div class="bookquote">``I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) to deliver
it, and I must keep my promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>In all these years Catherine had had time to forget how little she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had to
thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt for in the season of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) misery; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had long ago forgiven
Mrs. Penniman for taking too much upon herself. But for a moment this
attitude of interposition and disinterestedness, this carrying of
messages and redeeming of promises, brought back the sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
companion was a dangerous woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) would not be angry;
but for an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) felt sore. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care what you do with your
promise!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) answered.

<p/>Mrs. Penniman, however, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) high conception of the sanctity of
pledges, carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) point. <div class="bookquote">``I have gone too far to retreat,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) said,
though precisely what this meant she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) was not at pains to explain. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Townsend wishes most particularly to see you, Catherine; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) believes that
if you knew how much, and why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wishes it, you would consent to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``no good reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) happiness depends upon it. Is not that a good reason?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs.
Penniman impressively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for me. My happiness does not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you will be happier after you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is going away
again--going to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wanderings. It is a very lonely, restless,
joyless life. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) goes he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wishes to speak to you; it is a fixed
idea with him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) is always thinking of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) has something very
important to say to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) believes that you never understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)--that
you never judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) rightly, and the belief has always weighed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)
terribly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wishes to justify himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) believes that in a very few
words he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) could do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) wishes to meet you as a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had now had several days to accustom herself to think of Morris
Townsend again as an actuality. When it was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said simply,
<div class="bookquote">``Please say to Mr. Townsend that I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>) would leave me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at the door vibrated
through the summer night. Catherine looked up at the clock; it marked a
quarter-past nine--a very late hour for visitors, especially in the empty
condition of the town. Mrs. Penniman at the same moment gave a little
start, and then Catherine's eyes turned quickly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt. They met
Mrs. Penniman's and sounded them for a moment, sharply. Mrs. Penniman
was blushing; her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) look was a conscious one; it seemed to confess
something. Catherine guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aunt Penniman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said, in a tone that scared her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion, <div class="bookquote">``have you
taken the _liberty_ ... ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>stammered Mrs. Penniman, <div class="bookquote">``just wait till you see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Townsend</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) aunt, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was also frightened herself;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was on the point of rushing to give orders to the servant, who was
passing to the door, to admit no one; but the fear of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visitor
checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morris Townsend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard, vaguely but recognisably articulated by the
domestic, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hesitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) back turned to the door of
the parlour, and for some moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept it turned, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had
come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had not spoken, however, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faced about. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw a gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
aunt had discreetly retired.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would never have known him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was forty-five years old, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
figure was not that of the straight, slim young man she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remembered. But
it was a very fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, spreading
itself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect. After a
moment Catherine recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
visitor's clustering locks had grown thin, was still remarkably handsome.
He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``I
have ventured--I have ventured,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) paused, looking
about him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to sit down. It was the old
voice, but it had not the old charm. Catherine, for a minute, was
conscious of a distinct determination not to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to take a seat.
Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) come? It was wrong for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to come. Morris was embarrassed,
but Catherine gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) no help. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
embarrassment; on the contrary, it excited all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own liabilities of
this kind, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) great pain. But how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt so vividly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) ought not to have come? <div class="bookquote">``I wanted so much--I
was determined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>Morris went on. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stopped again; it was not easy.
Catherine still said nothing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) may well have recalled with
apprehension her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ancient faculty of silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) continued to look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), however, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made the strangest observation. It
seemed to be he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), and yet not he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>); it was the man who had been everything,
and yet this person was nothing. How long ago it was--how old she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
grown--how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had lived! She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had lived on something that was
connected with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)_, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had consumed it in doing so. This person
did not look unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed,
mature and complete. As Catherine looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) life
defined itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had made himself comfortable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had
never been caught. But even while her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) perception opened itself to this,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no desire to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) presence was painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
only wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) would go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you not sit down?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we had better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I offend you by coming?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was very grave; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) spoke in a tone of the
richest respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think you ought to have come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did not Mrs. Penniman tell you--did she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) not give you my message?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) told me something, but I did not understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would let _me_ tell you--let me speak for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for you, perhaps, but for me. It would be a great satisfaction--and
I have not many.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) seemed to be coming nearer; Catherine turned away.
<div class="bookquote">``Can we not be friends again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not enemies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``I have none but friendly feelings
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me to hear you say
that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine uttered no intimation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) measured the influence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) words; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) presently went on, <div class="bookquote">``You have not changed--the years
have passed happily for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have passed very quietly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have left no marks; you are admirably young.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
succeeded in coming nearer--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) glossy
perfumed beard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) eyes above it looking strange and hard. It was
very different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) old--from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) young--face. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had first seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) this way she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was
smiling, or trying to smile. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) voice,
<div class="bookquote">``I have never ceased to think of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't say those things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hate me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>Something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tone discouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), but in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) recovered
himself. <div class="bookquote">``Have you still some kindness for me, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why you have come here to ask me such things!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>Catherine
exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because for many years it has been the desire of my life that we should
be friends again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is impossible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so? Not if you will allow it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not allow it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again in silence. <div class="bookquote">``I see; my presence troubles you and
pains you. I will go away; but you must give me leave to come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't come again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never?--never?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made a great effort; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wished to say something that would make it
impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) should ever again cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) threshold. <div class="bookquote">``It is wrong of
you. There is no propriety in it--no reason for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, dearest lady, you do me injustice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris Townsend. <div class="bookquote">``We have
only waited, and now we are free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You treated me badly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if you think of it rightly. You had your quiet life with your
father--which was just what I could not make up my mind to rob you of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I had that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) cause that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) could not
add that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had had something more besides; for it is needless to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) had learnt the contents of Dr. Sloper's will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) was
nevertheless not at a loss. <div class="bookquote">``There are worse fates than that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
exclaimed, with expression; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) might have been supposed to refer to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) own unprotected situation. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) added, with a deeper tenderness,
<div class="bookquote">``Catherine, have you never forgiven me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgave you years ago, but it is useless for us to attempt to be
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if we forget the past. We have still a future, thank God!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't forget--I don't forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``You treated me too
badly. I felt it very much; I felt it for years.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went on,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wish to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) must not come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) this way, <div class="bookquote">``I can't
begin again--I can't take it up. Everything is dead and buried. It was
too serious; it made a great change in my life. I never expected to see
you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are angry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>cried Morris, who wished immensely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) could
extort some flash of passion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mildness. In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) might
hope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not angry. Anger does not last, that way, for years. But
there are other things. Impressions last, when they have been strong.
But I can't talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div><p/>Morris stood stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) beard, with a clouded eye. <div class="bookquote">``Why have you never
married?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) asked abruptly. <div class="bookquote">``You have had opportunities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't wish to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are rich, you are free; you had nothing to gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had nothing to gain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/CATHERINE</b></font>)</div>said Catherine.

<p/>Morris looked vaguely round him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), and gave a deep sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I was in
hopes that we might still have been friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant to tell you, by my aunt, in answer to your message--if you had
waited for an answer--that it was unnecessary for you to come in that
hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse my indiscretion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) bowed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away--standing there, averted, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes on
the ground, for some moments after she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) close the door of
the room.

<p/>In the hall he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) found Mrs. Penniman, fluttered and eager; she (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) appeared to
have been hovering there under the irreconcilable promptings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>)
curiosity and her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) dignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a precious plan of yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>said Morris, clapping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) so hard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Penniman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) doesn't care a button for me--with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) confounded little dry manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it very dry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Penniman, with solicitude.

<p/>Morris took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) question; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) stood musing an instant, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) hat on. <div class="bookquote">``But why the deuce, then, would she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) never marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--why indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Penniman/Penniman/MRS. PENNIMAN</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Penniman. And then, as if from a sense of
the inadequacy of this explanation, <div class="bookquote">``But you will not despair--you will
come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come back? Damnation!''  (<font color='red'><b>Morris/Morris Townsend/Mr. Townsend</b></font>)</div>And Morris Townsend strode out of the house,
leaving Mrs. Penniman staring.

<p/>Catherine, meanwhile, in the parlour, picking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Penniman</b></font>) morsel of fancy
work, had seated herself with it again--for life, as it were.

<p/>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

<p/>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

<p/>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
-LRB-$1 to $5,000-RRB- are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

<p/>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

<p/>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<p/>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<p/>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

<p/>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

<p/>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hart</b></font>) produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

<p/>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<p/>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

<p/>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
