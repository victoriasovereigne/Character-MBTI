<p/>In such pursuits if wisdom lies,

<p/>Wlio, Laura, can thy taste despise ?-- Gay

<p/>The drawing-room of Hollywell House was one of the favoured
apartments, where a peculiar air of home seems to reside,
whether seen in the middle of summer, all its large windows
open to the garden, or, as when our story commences, its bright
fire and stands of fragrant green-house plants contrasted with
the wintry fog and leafless trees of November. There were two
persons in the room -- a young lady, who sat drawing at the
round table, and a youth, lying on a couch near the lire, sur-
rounded with books and newspapers, and a pair of crutches
near him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). Both looked up with a smile of welcome at the
entrance of a tall^ fine-looking young man, whom each greeted
with <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>' Good morning, Laura. Good morning, Charles ; I am glad
you are down-stairs again ! How are you to-day ? '

<p/>' No way remarkable, thank you,'' was the answer, somewhat
wearily given by Charles.

<p/>' You walked f ' said Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Where's my uncle? I called at the post-office, and
brought a letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). It has the Moorworth post-mark,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, producing it.

<p/>' Where's that ? ' said Charles.

<p/>' The post-town to RedclyfFe ; Sir Guy Morville's place.''

<p/>' That old Sir Guy ! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) have to do with my
father?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you not know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, `that my uncle is to be
guardian to the boy -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grandson?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? No, I did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,'' said Philip ; ' when old Sir Guy made it an especial
point that my father should take the guardianship, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only
consented on condition that my uncle should be joined with
<div class="bookquote">`` B



<p/>2 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ; so now my uncle is alone in tlie trust, and I cannot help
thinking something must have happened at Redclyffe. It is
certainly not Sir Guy's writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must wait, unless your curiosity will carry you out in
search of impa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is somewhere about, zealously
supplying the place of Jenkins.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Phihp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, `there is no telling how much
good you have done him (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkins</b></font>) by convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkins</b></font>) of Jenkins' dis-
honesty. To say nothing of the benefit of being no longer
cheated, the pleasure of having to overlook the farming is
untold.''

<p/>Philip smiled, and came to the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was drawing.
' Do you know this place ? ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face.

<p/>' Stylehurst itself ! What is it taken from V ^

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From this pencil sketch of your sister's, which I found in
mamma's scrap-book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are making it very like, only the spire is too slender,
and that tree -- can't you alter the foliage ?-- it is an ash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Is it ? I took it for an elm.''

<p/>' And surely those trees in the foreground should be greener,
to throw back the middle distance. That is the peak of South
Moor exactly, if it looked further off.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) began the alterations, while Philip stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
progress, a shade of melancholy gathering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face. Sud-
denly, a voice called ' Laura ! Are you there 1 Open the door,
and you will see.''

<p/>On Philip's opening it, in came a tall camellia ; the laughing
face, and light, shining curls of the bearer peeping through the
dark green leaves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you! Oh, is it you, Philip? Oh, don't take it. I
must bring my own camellia to show Charlie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You make the most of that one flower,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Only see how many buds ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) placed it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sofa.
' Is it not a perfect blossom, so pure a white, and so regular !
And I am so proud of having beaten mamma and all the
gardeners, for not another will be out this fortnight ; and this
is to go to the horticultural show. Sam would hardly trust
me to bring it in, though it was my nursing, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, when the flower had been duly
admired, `you must let me put it into the window, for you.
It is too heavy for you.''

<p/>' Oh, take care,<div class="bookquote">'' cried Amabel, but too late ; for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took
it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), the solitary flower struck against Charles's little
table, and was broken off'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>' O Amy, I am very sorry. What a pity ! How did it
happen V

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answered; `it will last a long time in
water.''

<p/>' It was very unlucky-- I am very sorry-- especially because of
the horticultural show.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 3

<p/>*Make all your apologies to Sam/ said Amy, `his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) feelings
will be more hurt than mine. I dare say my poor flower would
have caught cold at the show, and never held up its head again.''

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tone was gay ; but Charles, who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face in the
glass, betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) by saying, ' Winking away a tear, O Amy ! '

<p/>' I never nursed a dear gazelle ! ' quoted Amy, with a merry
laugh ; and before any more could be said, there entered a
middle-aged gentleman, short and slight, with a fresh, weather-
beaten, good-natured face, gray whiskers, quick eyes, and a
hasty, undecided air in look and movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) greeted Philip
heartily, and the letter was given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha! Eh? Let us look. Not old Sir Guy's hand. Eh? What
can be the matter ? What ? Dead ! This is a sudden thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Dead ! Who ? Sir Guy Morville ? '

<p/>' Yes, quite suddenly -- poor old man.'' Then stepping to the
door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened it, and called, ' Mamma ; just step here a
minute, will you, mamma i '

<p/>The summons was obeyed by a tall, handsome lady, and
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) crept, with doubtful steps, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew not how
far to venture, a little girl of eleven, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned-up nose and
shrewd face full of curiosity. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) darted up to Amabel ; who,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and held up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) finger, smiled,
and took the little girl's hand, listening meanwhile to the
announcement, ' Do you hear this, mamma ? Here's a shocking
thing ! Sir Guy Morville dead, quite suddenly.''

<p/>' Indeed ! Well, poor man, I suppose no one ever repented or
suffered more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Who writes ? '

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grandson -- poor boy ! I can hardly make out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter.''
Holding it half a yard from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, so that all could see a few
lines of hasty, irregular writing, in a forcible hand, bearing
marks of having been penned under great distress and agitation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read aloud : --

<p/>' '' Dear Mr. Edmonstone, -- My dear grandfather died at six
this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had an attack of apoplexy yesterday even-
ing, and never spoke again, though for a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) knew
me. We hope he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) suffered little. Markham will make all
arrangements. We propose that the funeral should take place
on Tuesday ; I hope you will be able to come. I would write to
my cousin, Philip Morville, if I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) address ; but I depend
on you for saying all that ought to be said. Excuse this
illegible letter, -- I hardly know what I write.

<p/>' '' Yours very sincerely,

<p/>'<div class="bookquote">``Guy Morville.''  (<font color='red'><b>Poor fellow</b></font>)</div>''

<p/>' Poor fellow ! ' said Philip, ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) writes with a great deal of
proper feeling.''

<p/>' How very sad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to be left alone there ! ' said Mrs.
Edmonstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sad -- very,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``I must start off to

<p/>4 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) at once -- yes, at once. Should you not say so -- eh,

<p/>Philip r

<p/>' Certainly. I think I had better go with you. It would be
the correct thing, and I should not like to fail in any token of
respect for poor old Sir Guy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Of course -- of course,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone ; ' it would be
the correct thing. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was always very civil to us,
and you are next heir after this boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Little Charlotte made a sort of jump, lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyebrows,
and stared at Amabel.

<p/>Pliilip answered. ' That is not worth a thought ; but since
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and I are now the only representatives of the two branches
of the house of Morville, it shall not be my fault if the enmity
is not forgotten.''

<p/>' Buried in oblivion would sound more magnanimous,'' said
Charles ; at which Amabel laughed so uncontrollably, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
was forced to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little sister's shoulder.
Charlotte laughed too, an imprudent proceeding, as it attracted
attention. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father smiled, saying, lialf-reprovingly -- ``So
you are there, inquisitive pussy-cat?'' And at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother's
question, -- ``Charlotte, what business have you here?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
stole back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lessons, looking very small, without the
satisfaction of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother's compassionate words --
<div class="bookquote">``Poor child!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Edmonstone, returning to the
former subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is of the same age as Laura -- seventeen and a half,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Edmonstone. ' Don't you remember my brother
saying what a satisfaction it was to see such a noble baby as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was, after such a poor little miserable thing as the one
atRedclyffe?''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is grown into a fine spirited fellow,'' said Philip.

<p/>' I suppose we must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) here,'' said Mr. Edmonstone.
' Should you not say so-- eh, Philip ? '

<p/>' Certainly ; I should think it very good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Indeed,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grandfather's death lias happened at a most favourable time
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). The poor old man had such a dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going
wrong that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) '

<p/>' I know -- as tight as a drum.''

<p/>' With strictness that I should think very bad for a boy of
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) impatient temper. It would have been a very dangerous
experiment to send him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at once among the temptations of
Oxford, after such discipline and solitude as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has been
used to.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mr. Edmonstone, spreading
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hands in a deprecating manner. ' We must do the best
we can with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), for I have got him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) on my hands till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is
five-and-twenty -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) grandfather has tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) up till then,
if we can keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) out of mischief, well and good ; if not, it
can't be helped.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 5

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all to yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>' Ay, to my sorrow. If your poor father was alive, Philip, I
should be free of all care. I've a pretty deal on my hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
proceeded, looking more important than troubled. ``All that
great Redclyffe estate is no sinecure, to say nothing of the
youth himself. If all the world will come to me, I can't help
it. I must go and speak to the men, if I am to be ott' to
Redclyffe to-morrow. Will you come, Philip ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go back soon, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>replied Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I must
see about my leave ; only we should first settle when to set off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>This arranged, Mr. Edmonstone hurried away, and Charles
began by saying, ' Isn't there a ghost at Redclyffe ? '

<p/>' So it is said,'' answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin ; ' though I don't think it
is certain whose it is. There is a room called Sir Hugh's
Chamber, over the gateway, but the honour of naming it is
undecided between Hugo de Morville, who murdered Thomas h,
Becket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) namesake, the first Baronet, who lived in the
time of William of Orange, when the quarrel began with our
branch of the family. Do you know the history of it, aunt ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was about some property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone, `though
I don't know the rights of it. But the Morvilles were always a
fiery, violent race, and the enmity once begun between Sir
Hugh and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) brother, was kept up, generation after genera-
tion, in a most unjustifiable way. Even I can remember when
the Morvilles of Redclyffe used to be spoken of in our family
like a sort of ogres.''

<p/>' Not undeservedly, I should think,'' said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``This poor
old man, who is just dead, ran a strange career. Stories of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
duels and mad freaks are still extant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Poor man</b></font>)</div><p/>' Poor man ! I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went all lengths,'' said Mrs. Edmon-
stone.

<p/>' What was the true version of that horrible story about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
son 1 ' said Philip. ' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' Oh, no ! it was bad enough Avithout that.''

<p/>' How ? ' asked Laura.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was an only child, and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mother early. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
very ill brought up, and was as impetuous and violent as Sir
Guy himself, though with much kindliness and generosity, * He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was only nineteen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made a runaway marriage with a
girl of sixteen, the sister of a violin player, who was at that
time in fashion. His (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) father was very much offended, and there
was much dreadfully violent conduct on each side. At last, the
young man was driven to seek a reconciliation. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to Moorworth, and rode to Redclyffe, to have an inter-
view with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. Unhappily, Sir Guy was giving a dinner
to the hunt, and had been drinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not only refused to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), but I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used shocking language, and said
something about bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fiddling brother-
in-law. The son was waiting in the hall, heard everything,
threw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) horse, and rushed away in tha dark. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)



<p/>6 THE HEIR OF EEDCLYFFE

<p/>forehead struck against the branch of a tree, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was killed
on the spot.''

<p/>' The poor wife ? ' asked Amabel, shuddering.

<p/>*She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) died the next day, when this boy was born.''

<p/>' Frightful ! ' said Philip. ' It might well make a reformation
in old Sir Guy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard that nothing could be more awful than the
stillness that fell on that wretched party, even before they
knew what had happened -- before Colonel Harewood, who had
been called aside by the servants, could resolve to come and
fetch away the father. No wonder Sir Guy was a changed man
from that hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' It was then that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sent for my father,'' said Philip. ' But
what made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) think of doing so ? '

<p/>' You know Colonel Harewood's house at Stylehurst ? Many
years ago, when the St. Mildred's races used to be so much
more in fashion. Sir Guy and Colonel Plarewood, and some men
of that stamp, took that house amongst them, and used to
spend some time there every year, to attend to sometJiing
about the training of the horses. There were some malpractices
of their servants, that did so much harm in the parish, that my
brother was obliged to remonstrate. Sir Guy was very angry
at first, but behaved better at last than any of the others. I
suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was struck by my dear brother's bold, uncompromis-
ing ways, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to a certain degree -- and my
brother could not help being interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), there seemed to
be so much goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nature. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) once, and never
did I meet any one who gave me so much the idea of a finished
gentleman. When the poor son was about fourteen, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was
with a tutor in the neighbourhood, and used to be a good deal
at Stylehurst, and, after the unhappy marriage, my brother
happened to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in London, heard his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) story, and tried to
bring about a reconciliation.''

<p/>' Ha ! ' said Philip ; ' did not they come to Stylehurst ? I have
a dim recollection of somebody very tall, and a lady who sung.''

<p/>' Yes ; your father asked them to stay there, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might
judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and wrote to Sir Guy that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a little, gentle,
childish thing, capable of being moulded to anything, and repre-
senting the mischief of leaving them to such society as that of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother, who was actually maintaining them. That letter
was never answered, but about ten days or a fortnight after this
terrible accident. Colonel Harewood wrote to entreat my brother
to come to Pvedclyffe, saying poor Sir Guy had eagerly caught at
the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) name. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went at once, and lie
told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) experience as a clergyman, saw
any one so completely broken down with grief.''

<p/>' I found a great many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) letters among my father's papers,<div class="bookquote">''
said Philip ; ' and it was a very touching one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wrote to
me on my father's death. Those Redclyffe people certainly have
great force of character.''



 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 7

<p/>' And was it then he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) settled his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) property on my uncle ? ' said
Charles.

<p/>``Yes/ said Mrs, Edmonstone. <div class="bookquote">``My brother did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
doing so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not be at rest till it was settled. It was
in vain to put him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grandchild, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not
believe it could live ; and, indeed, its life hung on a thread. I
remember my brother telling me how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to' Moorworth to
see it -- for it could not be brought home -- in hopes of bringing
back a report tliat might clieer its grandfather, but how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
found it so weak and delicate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) did not dare to try to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) take interest in it. It was not till the child was two
or three years old, that Sir Guy ventured to let liimself grow
fond of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy Morville/Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Sir Guy was a very striking person,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' I shall
not easily forget my visit to Redclyfie four years ago. It was
more like a scene in a romance than anything real -- tlie fine
old red sandstone house crumbling away in the exposed parts ;
the arched gateway covered with ivy ; the great quadrangle
where the sun never shone, and full of echoes ; the large hall
and black wainscoted rooms, which the candles never would
liglit up. It is a fit place to be haunted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy a person</b></font>)</div><p/>' That poor boy alone there ! ' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' I am
glad you and your uncle are going to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).''

<p/>' Tell us about him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),'' said Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the most incongruous thing there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip.
``There was a calm, deep melancholy about the old man, added
to the grand courtesy which showed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been what old books
call a fine gentleman, that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house as a hermit
does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cell, or a knight his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) castle; but breaking in on this
penseroso scene, there was Guy '

<p/>' In what way ? ' asked Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Always in wild s`pirits, rushing about, playing antics, pro-
voking the solemn echoes with shouting, whooping, singing,
whistling. There was something in that whistle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that
always made me angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this suit Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' How did this suit old Sir Guy ? '

<p/>' It was curious to see how Guy could rattle on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), pour
out the whole history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) doings, laughing, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands,
springing about with animation -- all with as little answer as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been talking to a statue.''

<p/>' Do you mean that Sir Guy did not like it ? '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own way. There was now and then a glance
or a nod, to show tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was attending ; Init it was such slight
encouragement, that any less buoyant spirits must have been
checked.''

<p/>' Did you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), on the whole ? ' asked Laura. ' I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
has not this tremendous Morville temper ? Oh, you don't say so.
What a grievous thing.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is a fine fellow,'' said Philip ; ' but I did not think Sir
Guy managed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) well. Poor old man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite wrapped up



<p/>3 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and only thought how to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) out of harm's way.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would never let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) be with other boys, and kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so
fettered by rules, so strictly watched, and so sternly called to
account, that I cannot think how any boy could stand it.''

<p/>' Yet, you say, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told everything freely to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather,''
said Amy.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' added her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, ' I was going to say that, as long as
that went on, I should think all safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I said before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>resumed Philip, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has a great deal of
frankness, much of the making of a iine character ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is a
thorough Morville. I remember something that will show you
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) best and worst sides. You know Redclyffe is a beautiful
place, with magnihcent cliffs overhanging the sea, and fine woods
crowning them. On one of the most inaccessible of these crags
there was a hawk's nest, about half-way down, so that looking
from the top of the precipice, we could see the old birds fly in
and out. Well, what does Master Guy do, but go down this
headlong descent after the nest. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) escaped alive no one
could guess ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather could not bear to look at the
place afterwards -- but climb it he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did, and came back with two
young hawks, buttoned up inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) jacket.''

<p/>' There's a regular brick for you ! ' cried Charles, delighted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heart was set on training these birds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned the
library upside down in search of books on falconry, and spent
every spare moment on them. At last, a servant left some door
open, and they escaped. I shall never forget Guy's passion ; I
am sure I don't exaggerate when I say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was perfectly beside
himself with anger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Poor boy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Poor boy ! ' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Served the rascal right,'' said Charles.

<p/>* Nothing had any effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) till his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandfather came out,
and, at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was tamed in an instant, hung his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
head, came up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandfather, and said -- <div class="bookquote">'' I am very sorry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>Sir Guy answered, <div class="bookquote">'' My poor boy ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>and there was not another
word. I saw Guy no more that day, and all the next he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
quiet and subdued. But the most remarkable part of the story
is to come. A couple of days afterwards we were walking in
the woods, when, at the sound of Guy's whistle, we heard a
flapping and rustling, and beheld, tumbling along, with their
clipped wings, these two identical hawks, very glad to be
caught. They drew themselves up proudly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to stroke
them, and their yellow eyes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with positive affection.''

<p/>' Pretty creatures ! ' said Amabel. ' That is a very nice end
to the story.''

<p/>*It is not the end,'' said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I was surprised to see Guy
so sober, instead of going into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) usual raptures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
took them home ; but the first thing I heard in the morning
was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was gone to offer them to a farmer, to keep the
birds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fruit,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) do it of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) o-wn accord 1 ' asked Laura,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was just what I wanted to know ; but any hint about
them brought such a cloud over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face that I thought it would
be wanton to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) by questions. However, I must be
going. Good-bye, Amy, I hope your camellia will have another

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Put the feud in your pocket till
you can bury it in old Sir Guy's grave, unless you mean to fight
it out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandson, which would be more romantic and
exciting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip was gone before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could finish. Mrs. Edmonstone
looked annoyed, and Laura said, <div class="bookquote">``Charlie, I wish you would
not let your spirits carry you away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' I wish I had anything else to carry me away ! ' was the reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mother, looking sadly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). ``Your high
spirits are a blessing ; but why misuse them 1 If they are given
to support you through pain and confinement, why make mis-
chief with them 1 '

<p/>Charles looked more impatient than abashed, and the com-
punction seemed chiefly to rest with Amabel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone, <div class="bookquote">``I must go and see after my
poor little prisoner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! ' said Laura, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went ; ' it was no kindness in you
to encourage Charlotte to stay. Amy, when you know how
often that inquisitive temper has got her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) into scrapes.''

<p/>' I suppose so,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, regretfully ; ' but I had not the
heart to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``That is just what Philip says, that you only want bones and
sinews in your character to '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Laura,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>interrupted Charles, <div class="bookquote">``I won't hear Philip's
criticisms of my sister. I had rather she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had no bones at all,
than that they stuck out and ran into me. There are plenty of
angles already in the world, without sharpening hers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) possessed himself of Amy's round, plump, childish liand,
and spread out over it his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) still whiter, and very bony fingers,
pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) `soft pinky cushions,<div class="bookquote">'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called them, `not
meant for studying anatomy upon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! you two spoil each other sadly,'' said Laura, smiling, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do Philip and Laura do to each other?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Charles.

<p/>' Improve each other, I suppose,'' said Amabel, in a shy, simple
tone, at which Charles laughed heartily.

<p/>' I wish I was as sensible as Laura ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), presently, with
a sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never was a more absurd wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, tormenting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hand still more, and jDulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) curls ; ' unwisli it fortliwith.
Where should I be without silly little Amy ? If every one
weighed my wit before laughing, I should not often be in dis-
grace for my high spirits, as they call them.''



<p/>10 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so little younger than Laura/ said Amy, still sadly,
though smiling.

<p/>' Folly/ said Charles ; ' you are quite wise enough for your
age, while Laura is so prematurely wise, that I am in constant
dread that nature will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) revenge by causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to do
something strikingly foolish ! '

<p/>' Nonsense ! ' cried Amy, indignantly. ' Laura do anything
foolish!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I should enjoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>proceeded Charles, `would be to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) over head and ears in love with this hero, and Philip
properly jealous.''

<p/>' How can you say such things, Charlie ? '

<p/>' Why ? was there ever a beauty who did not fall in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father's ward V

<p/>' No ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought to live alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) very old father and
horribly grim maiden aunt.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Amy, you shall be the maiden aunt.''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>And as
Laura returned at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that they
had been agreeing that no hero ever failed to fall in love with
his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) guardian's beautiful daughter.

<p/>' If his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) guardian had a beautiful daughter,'' said Laura, resolved
not to be disconcerted.

<p/>' Did you ever hear such barefaced fishing for compliments ? '
said Charles ; but Amabel, who did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sister to be
teased, and was also conscious of having wasted a good deal of
time, sat down to practise. Laura returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) drawing, and
Charles, with a yawn, listlessly turned over a newspaper, while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fair delicate features, which would have been handsome but
that they were blanched, sharpened, and worn with pain, gra-
dually lost their animated and rather satirical expression, and
assumed an air of weariness and discontent.

<p/>Charles was at this time nineteen, and for the last ten years
had been afflicted with a disease in the hip- joint, which, in spite
of the most anxious care, caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) frequent and severe suffer-
ing, and had occasioned such a contraction of tlie limb as to
cripple him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) completely, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) general health was so mucli
affected as to render him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) an object of constant anxiety. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother had always been his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) most devoted and indefatigable
nurse, giving up everything for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sake, and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) night
and day. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father attended to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) least caprice, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
sisters were, of course, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) slaves ; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was the undisputed
sovereign of the whole family.

<p/>The two elder girls liad b^en entirely under a governess till a
month or two before the opening of our story, when Laura was
old enough to he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) introduced ; and the governess departing, the
two sisters became Charles's companions in the drawing-room,
while Mrs. Edmonstone, who had a peculiar taste and talent for
teaching, undertook little Charlotte's lessons herself.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE ii



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>If the ill spirit have so fair a house,

<p/>Good things will strive to dwell with `t.-- The Tempest

<p/>One of the pleasantest rooms at Hollywell was Mrs. Eclmon-
stone's dressing-room -- large and bay-windowed, over the
drawing-room, having little of the dressing-room but tlie name,
and a toilet-table with a black and gold japanned glass, and curi-
ously shaped boxes to match ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) room opened into it on one
side, and Charles's on the other ; it was a sort of up-stairs
parlour, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) taught Charlotte, cast up accounts, spoke to
servants, and wrote notes, and where Charles was usually to be
found, when unequal to coming down-stairs. It had an air of
great snugness, with its large folding-screen, covered with prints
and caricatures of ancient date, its book-shelves, its tables, its
peculiarly easy arm-chairs, the great invalid sofa, and the grate,
which always lighted up better than any other in the house.

<p/>In the bright glow of the fire, with the shutters closed and cur-
tains drawn, lay Charles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) couch, one Monday evening, in a
gorgeous dressing-gown of a Chinese pattern, all over pagodas,
while little Charlotte sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), curled up on a foot-
stool. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not always very civil to Charlotte ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sometimes
came into collision with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), too, was a pet, and had a
will of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, and at other times she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; but just
now they had a common interest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was gracious.

<p/>' It is striking six, so they must soon be here. I wish mamma
would let me go down ; but I must wait till after dinner.''

<p/>' Then, Charlotte, as soon as you come in, hold up your hands,
and exclaim, <div class="bookquote">'' What a guy ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>There will be a compliment ! '

<p/>' No, Charlie ; I promised mamma and Laura that you should
get me into no more scrapes.''

<p/>' Did you ? The next promise you make had better depend
upon yourself alone.''

<p/>' But Amy said I must be quiet, because poor Sir Guy will be
too sorrowful to like a racket ; and when Amy tells me to be
quiet, I know that I must, indeed.''

<p/>^Most true,'' said Charles, laughing.

<p/>' Do you think you shall like Sir Guy ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be able to determine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, sententiously,
' when I have seen whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brushes his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hair to the right or left.''

<p/>' Pliilip bruslies his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to the left.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then undoubtedly Sir Guy will brush his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to the right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there not some horrid story about those Morvilles of
Redclyffe?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>asked Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``I asked Laura, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) told
me not to be curious, so I knew there was something in it ;
and then I asked Amy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said it would be no pleasure
to me to know.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>12 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I would have you prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Why, what is it ? Oh ! dear Charlie ! are you really going
to tell meV

<p/>' Did you ever hear of a deadly feud ? '

<p/>' I have read of them in the history of Scotland. They went
on hating and killing each other for ever. There was one man
who made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemy's children eat out of a pig-trough, and
another who cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.''

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) enemy's, and put it on the table, at breakfast, with
a i:'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>iece of bread in its mouth.''

<p/>' Very well ; whenever Sir Guy serves up Philip's head at
breakfast, with a piece of bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mouth, let me know.''

<p/>Charlotte started up. <div class="bookquote">``Charles, what do you mean? Such
things don't happen now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nevertheless, there is a deadly feud between the two
branches of the house of Morville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But it is very wrong,'' said Charlotte, looking frightened.

<p/>' Wrong 1 Of course it is.''

<p/>' Philip won't do anything wrong. But how will they ever
get on?''

<p/>' Don't you see ? It must be our serious endeavour to keep
the peace, and prevent occasions of discord.''

<p/>' Do you think anything will happen ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is much to be apprehended,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, solemnly.

<p/>At that moment the sound of wheels was lieard, and Charlotte
flew off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) private post of observation, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother
delighted at having mystified her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) returned on tip-toe.
' Papa and Sir Guy are come, but not Philip ; I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
anywhere.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! you have not looked in Sir Guy's great-coat pocket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I wish you would not plague me so ! You are not in earnest ? '

<p/>The pettish inquiring tone was exactly what delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) continued to tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in the same style till Laura and
Amabel came running in with their report of the stranger.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is come ! ' they cried, with one voice.

<p/>' Very gentlemanlike ! ' said Laura.

<p/>' Very pleasant looking,'' said Amy. ' Such fine eyes ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so much expression,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura. ' Oh ! '

<p/>The exclamation, and the start which accompanied it, were
caused by hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father's voice close to the door, which
had been left partly open. <div class="bookquote">``Here is poor Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>it said,
' come in, and see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ; get over the first introduction-- eh,
Guy?'' And before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had finished, both he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and the guest
were in the room, and Chailotte full of mischievous glee at lier
sister's confusion.

<p/>' Well, Charlie, boy, how goes it ? ' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) father's greeting.
' Better, eh ? Sorry not to find you down-stairs ; but I liave
brought Guy to see you.'' Then, as Charles sat up and shook
hands with Sir Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) continued-- <div class="bookquote">``A fine chance for you, ag



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 13

<p/>I was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), to have a companion always at hand : a fine
chance 1 eh, Charlie 1 '

<p/>' I am not so unreasonable as to expect any one to be always
at hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Charles, smiling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked up at the frank,
open face, and lustrous hazel eyes turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with compassion
at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crippled, helpless figure, and with a bright,
cordial promise of kindness.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoke, a pattering sound approached, the door was
pushed open, and while Sir Guy exclaimed, ' O, Bustle ! Bustle !
I am very sorry,'' there suddenly appeared a large beautiful
spaniel, with a long silky black and white coat, jetty curled
ears, tan spots above his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intelligent eyes, and tan legs, fringed
with silken waves of hair. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tail at
having found his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) master, but crouching and looking beseeching
at meeting no welcome, while Sir Guy seemed much distressed
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intrusion.

<p/>' O you beauty ! ' cried Charles. ' Come here, you fine fellow.''

<p/>Bustle only looked wistfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) master, and moved nothing
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feather of a tail.

<p/>' Ah ! I was afraid you would repent of your kindness,'' said
Sir Guy to Mr. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Not at all, not at all ! ' was the answer ; ' mamma never
objects to in-door pets, eh. Amy?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A tender subject, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura ; ' poor Pepper ! '

<p/>Amy, ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) disposition to cry at the remembrance
of the dear departed rough terrier, bent down to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
glowing face, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand to the dog, which at last
ventured to advance, still creeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) body curved till
his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) tail was foremost, looking imploringly at his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) master, as if
to entreat his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) j-RRB-ardon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure you don't dislike it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>inquired Sir Guy, of
Charles.

<p/>' I ? O no. Here, you fine creature.''

<p/>' Come, then, behave like a rational dog, since you are come,''
said Sir Guy ; and Bustle, resuming the deportment of a spirited
and well-bred spaniel, no longer crouched and curled himself
into the shape of a comma, but bounded, wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tail, thrust
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) nose into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) master's hand, and then proceeded to reconnoitre
the rest of the company, paying especial attention to Charles,
putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fore-paws on the sofa, and rearing himself up to
contemplate him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with a grave, polite curiosity, that was very
diverting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `did you ever see the like
of such a dressing-gown? Are you satisfied? Give me your
paw, and let us swear an eternal friendship.''

<p/>' I am quite glad to see a dog in the house again,'' said Laura ;
and, after a few more compliments. Bustle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) master
followed Mr. Edmonstone out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of my father's well-judged proceedings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>murmured
Charles. ' That poor fellow had rather have gone a dozen miles

to inflict such dressing-gowns on me, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should give me notice

<p/>' Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Amabel, consolingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not ask about Philip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, with great
earnestness.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is staying at Thorndale, and then going to St. Mildred<div class="bookquote">``s,''
 (<font color='red'><b>St. Mildred 's/St. Mildred/Mildred</b></font>)</div>said Laura.

<p/>' I hope you are relieved,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked
in doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ought to laugh.

<p/>' And what do you think of Sir Guy ? '

<p/>' May he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only be worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dog ! ' replied Charles.

<p/>' Ah ! ' said Laura, ' many men are neither worthy of their
wives, nor of their dogs.''

<p/>' Dr. Henley, I suppose, is the foundation of that aphorism,''
said Charles.

<p/>' If Margaret Morville could marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) could hardly be
too worthy,'' said Laura. <div class="bookquote">``Think of throAving away Philip's
whole soul ! '

<p/>' O Laura, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not lose that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amabel.

<p/>Laura looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew more ; but at that moment, both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father and mother entered, the former rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always did when much pleased, and sending his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice
before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed, ' Well, Charlie, well, young ladies,
is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) a fine fellow -- eh?''

<p/>' Rather under-sized,'' said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'ll grow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is not eighteen, you know; plenty
of time ; a very good height ; you can't expect every one to be

been? -- any pain?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>^

<p/>' Hem -- rather,'' said Charles, shortly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hated answering
kind inquiries, when out of humour.

<p/>' Ah, that's a pity ; I was sorry not to find you in the drawing-
room, but I thought you would have liked just to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),'' said
Mr. Edmonstone, disappointed, and apologizing.

<p/>' I had rather have liad some notice of your intention,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Charles ; ' I would have made myself fit to be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry. I thought you would have liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) coming,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said poor Mr. Edmonstone, only half conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) offence ;
' but I see you are not well this evening.''

<p/>Worse and worse, for it was equivalent to openly telling
Charles he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was out of humour ; and seeing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother's motive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was still further annoyed when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hastily
interposed a question about Sir Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should only hear them talk about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at Redclyffe,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Edmonstone. ' No one was ever equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), accord-

<p/>all of them. Such attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) grandfather, such proper
feeling, so good-natured, not a bit of pride -- it is my firm belief
that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) will make up for all his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) family before him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).''

<p/>Charles set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyebrows sarcastically.

<p/>' How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) get on with Philip ? ' inquired Laura,

<p/>' Excellently. Just what could be wished. Philip is delighted
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; and I have been telling Guy all the way home what
a capital friend he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is quite inclined to look up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).'' Charles made an exaggerated gesture of astonishment,
unseen by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father. ' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would
have left it, but they seemed so fond of each other, I thought
it was a pity to part them, and that I could promise it should
be welcome here ; eh, mamma V

<p/>' Certainly. I am very glad you brought it.''

<p/>``We are to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) horse and man in a little while. A
beautiful chestnut -- anything to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is terribly
cut up about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/>It was now time to go down to dinner ; and after Charles
had made faces of weariness and disgust at all the viands
proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, almost imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to like
them, and had at last ungraciously given her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) leave to send what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not quite say he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) disliked, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was left to carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
teasing of Cliarlotte, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grumbling over the dinner, for
about the space of an hour, when Amabel came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
and Charlotte went down.

<p/>' Hum ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) exclaimed. ' Another swan of my father<div class="bookquote">``s.''

<p/>' But every one at RedclyfFe speaks so well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

<p/>' As if the same things were not said of every heir to more
acres than brains ! However, I could have swallowed everything
but the disposition to adore Philip. Either it was gammon on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) part, or else the work of my father's imagination.''

<p/>' For shame, Charlie.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it within the bounds of probability that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should be

very correct and sententious cousin, a poor subaltern, and the
next in the entail? Depend upon it, it is a fiction created

<p/>^Oh, the dog is the most delightful creature I ever saw, so
sensible and well-mannered.''

<p/>' It was of the man that I asked.''

<p/>*He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said hardly anything, and sometimes started if papa
spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) suddenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) ^\dnced as if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could not bear to
be called Sir Guy, so papa said we should call him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
name, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would do the same by us. I am glad of it, for it
seems more friendly, and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wants to be comforted.''

<p/>' Don't waste your compassion, my dear ; few men need it less.
With his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) property, those moors to shoot over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own master,
and with health to enjoy it, there are plenty who would change
Avith him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), for all your pity, my silly little Amy.''

<p/>' Surely not, with that horrible ancestry.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All very well to plume oneself upon. I rather covet that

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, if you watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face, I think you would be sorry
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' I am tired of the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) name ! One fifth of November
is enough in the year. Here, find something to read to me
among that trumpery.''

<p/>Amy read till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was summoned to tea, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found a
conversation going on about Philip, on whose history Sir Guy
did not seem fully informed. Philip was the son of Archdeacon
Morville, Mrs. Edmonstone's brother, an admirable and superior
man, who had been dead about five years. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left three
cliildren, Margaret and Fanny, twenty-five and twenty-three
years of age, and Philip, just seventeen. The boy was at the
head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) school, highly distinguished for application and
good conduct ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had attained every honour there open to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), won golden opinions from all concerned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and
made proof of talents which could not have failed to raise him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to the highest university distinctions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was absent from
home at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's death, which took place after
so short an illness, that there had been no time to summon him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
back to Stylehurst. Very little property was left to be divided
among the three ; and as soon as Philip perceived how small
was the provision for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hopes of
university honours, and obtained a commission in tlie army.

<p/>On hearing this, Sir Guy started forward : ' Noble ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cried,
' and yet what a pity ! If my grandfather had but known
it ^

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I was convinced of that^^ broke in Mr. Edmonstone,
' and so, I am sure, was Philip himself ; but in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew we

self, wrote to Lord Thorndale, and never said a word, even to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sisters, till the thing was done. I never was more surprised
in my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div><p/>' One would almost envy him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) the opportunity of making such
a sacrifice,<div class="bookquote">'' said Sir Guy, ' yet one must lament it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know Lord Thorndale?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmon/Edmon</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmon-

mission, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has put his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) son into the same regiment, on
purpose to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) under Philip's eye. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is at

lashes uncommonly thick and black ; the eyebrows were also
very darkfand of I sharply-defined angular shape but the hair
was much lighter, loose, soft, and wavy ; the natural fairness

waited on Charles and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) flowers, or Laura drew, wrote letters,
and strove to keep down the piles of books and periodicals
under which it seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) brother might some day be
stifled -- a vain task, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sure to want immediately what-
ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) put out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) reach,

<p/>Laura and Amabel both played and sung, the former remark-
ably well ; and the first time they had any music after the
arrival of Sir Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) look of delighted attention struck every-
one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ventured nearer, stood by the piano when they
practised, and at last joined in with a few notes of so full and
melodious a voice, that Laura turned round in surprise, ex-
claiming, ' You sing better than any of us ! '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) coloured. ' I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, ' I could not help
it ; I know nothing of music'

<p/>' Really ! ' said Laura, smiling incredulously.

<p/>' I don't even know the notes.''

<p/>' Then you must have a very good ear. Let us try again.''

<p/>The sisters were again charmed and surprised, and Guy
looked gratified, as people do at the discovery of a faculty
which they are particularly glad to possess. It was the first
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) appeared to brighten, and Laura and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother
agreed that it would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good to have plenty of music, and
to try to train that fine voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was beginning to interest
them all greatly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) great helpfulness and kindness to
Charles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) learnt the sort of assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) required, as well
as by the silent grief that showed how much attached he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must
have been to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandfather.

<p/>On the first Sunday, Mrs. Edmonstone coming into the
drawing-room at about half -past five, found him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sitting alone
by the fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dog lying at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feet. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) started up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been here in the dark ever since church-time '?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not wanted light,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered with a sigh, long,
deep, and irrepressible, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) stirred the fire, the flame
revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) the traces of tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) longed to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
and said --

<p/>' This Sunday twilight is a quiet time for thinking.''

<p/>' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said ; ' how few Sundays ago -- ' and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) paused.

<p/>' Ah ! you had so little preparation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None. That very morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had done business with
Markham, and had never been more clear and collected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was taken ilU' asked Mrs.
Edmonstone, perceiving that it would be a relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to talk.

<p/>' No ; it was just before dinner. I had been shooting, and
went into the library to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) where I had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
well then, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke, but it was getting dark, and I did not

<p/>2^ THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>see his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face. I don't think I was ten minutes dressing, but
when I came down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had sunk back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) chair. I saw
it was not sleep -- I rang -- and when Arnaud came, we knew
how it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) voice became low with strong emotion.

<p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) consciousness ? '

<p/>' Yes, that was the comfort,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, eagerly. ' It was after
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been bled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed to wake up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not
speak or move, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked at me -- or -- I don't know what I
should have done.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The last words were almost inaudible
from the gush of tears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) vainly struggled to repress,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was turning away to hide them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw that Mrs.
Edmonstone's were flowing fast.

<p/>' You had great reason to be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>),
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could speak.

<p/>' Indeed, indeed I had.<div class="bookquote">'' And after a long silence -- ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
everything to me, everything from the first hour I can recollect.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never let me miss my parents. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attended to all
my pleasures and wishes, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) watched and cared for me,
and bore with me, even I can never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke in short half sentences of intense feeling, and Mrs.
Edmonstone was much moved by such affection in one said
to have been treated with an excess of strictness, much com-
passionating the lonely boy, who had lost every family tie
in one.

<p/>' When the first pain of the sudden parting has passed,<div class="bookquote">'' said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), ' you will like to remember the affection which you knew
how to value.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' If I had but known ! ' said Guy ; ' but there was I, hasty,
reckless, disregarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) comfort, rebelling against -- O, what
would I not give to have those restraints restored ! '

<p/>' It is what we all feel in such losses,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.
' There is always much to wish otherwise ; but I am sure you
can have the happiness of knowing you were his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) great comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' It was what I ought to have been.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew that nothing could have been more filial and affec-
tionate than his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conduct, and tried to say something of the
kind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not listen.

<p/>' That is worst of all,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said ; ' and you must not trust wliat
they say of me. They would be sure to praise me, if I was
anything short of a brute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>A silence ensued, while Mrs. Edmonstone was trying to tliink
of some consolation. Suddenly Guy looked up, and spoke
eagerly : --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to ask something -- a great favour-- but you make
me venture. You see how I am left alone -- you know how little
I can trust myself. Will you take me in hand -- let me talk
to you -- and tell me if I am wrong, as freely as if I were
Charles? I know it is asking a great deal, but you kne^v
my grandfather, and it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hand, and with tears answered -- :



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 21

<p/>' Indeed I will, if I see any occasion.''

<p/>``You will let me trust to you to tell me when I get too
vehement 1 above all, when you see my temper failing ? Tliank
you ; you don't know what a relief it is ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must not call yourself alone. You are one of
us now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; since you have made that promise,'' said Guy ; and for
the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw the full beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) smile -- a sort of
sweetness and radiance of which eye and brow partook almost
as much as the lips. It alone would have gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) heart,

<p/>' I must look on you as a kind of nephew,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) added, kindly.
' I used to hear so much of you from my brother,''

 (<font color='red'><b>nephew</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! ' cried Guy, lighting up, ' Archdeacon Morville was
always so kind to me. I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) very well ! '

<p/>' Ah ! I wish ' there she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) paused, and added, -- ' it is not

<p/>right to wish such things -- and Philip is very like his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father.''

<p/>' I am very glad his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regiment is so near. I want to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
better.''

<p/>' You knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at Redclyffe, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was staying there ? '

<p/>' Yes,'' said Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) colour rising ; ' but I was a boy then, and
a very foolish, headstrong one, I am glad to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again.
What a grand.-looking person he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is ! '

<p/>' We are very proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.
*I don't think there has been an hour's anxiety about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was born.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The conversation was interrupted by the sound of Charles's
crutches slowly crossing the hall. Guy sprang to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sofa, and then, without speaking, hurried up-stairs.

<p/>' Mamma, tete-a-tete with the silent one ! ' exclaimed Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not tell you all I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), leaving
the room.

<p/>' Hum ! ' soliloquised Charles. ' That means that my lady
mother has adopted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and thinks I should laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
or straightway set up a dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), knowing my contempt
for heroes and hero-worship. It's a treat to have Philip out
of the way, and if it was but possible to get out of hearing
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) perfection, I should have some peace. If I thought this
fellow had one spice of the kind, I'd never trouble my head
about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) more ; and yet I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has such a pair of
hawk's eyes for nothing ! '

<p/>The hawk's eyes, as Charles called them, shone brighter
from that day forth, and their owner began to show more
interest in what passed around. Laura was much amused
by a little conversation she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) held with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) one day when a
party of their younger neighbours were laughing and talking
nonsense round Charles's sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was sitting a little way
off in silence, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) took advantage of the loud laughing
to say :

<p/>' You think this is not very satisfactory ? ' And as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave
a quick glance of inquiry -- ' Don't mind saying so, Philip and



<p/>22 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>I often agree that it is a pity to spend so much time in laughing
at nothing -- at such nonsense.''

<p/>' Is it nonsense ? ' _ ^

<p/>' Listen -- no, don't, it is too silly/

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense must be an excellent thing if it makes people
so happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, thoughtfully. ' Look at them ; they are
like -- not a picture -- that has no life -- but a dream -- or, per-
haps, a scene in a i^lay.''

<p/>' Did you never see anything like it 1 '

<p/>' Oh, no ! All the morning calls I ever saw were formal,
every one stiff, and speaking by rote, or talking jDolitics. How
glad I used to be to get on horseback again ! But to see these
-- why, it is like the shejDherd's giimi3se at tlie pixies ! -- as one
reads a new book, or watches what one only half understands -- a
rook's parliament, or a gathering of sea-fowl on the Shag Rock.''

<p/>' A rook's parliament ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The people at home call it a rook's parliament when a whole
cloud of rooks settle on some bare, wide common, and sit there
as if they were consulting, not feeding, only stalking about
with drooping wings, and solemn, black cloaks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You have found a flattering simile,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' as you know
that rooks never open their mouths without cause.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy had never heard the riddle, but lie caught the pun
instantly, and the clear merry sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hearty laugh
surprised Charles, who instantly noted it as another proof that
there was some life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>Indeed, each day began to make it evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had, on
the whole, rather a superabundance of animation than otherwise.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite confidential with Mrs. Edmonstone, on whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
used to lavish, with boyish eagerness, all that interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) the jDassages in books that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
about Redclyffe's affairs, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) letters from Mark-
ham, the steward. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head was full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liorse, Deloraine,
which was coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) under the charge of a groom, and
the consultations were endless about the means of transport,
Mr. Edmonstone almost as eager about it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did not so quickly become at home with the younger
portion of the family, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) spirits rose every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
whistled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) walked in the garden, and Bustle, instead
of pacing soberly behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>), now capered, nibbled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) jDockets,
and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) into games of play which Charles and Amabel
were charmed to overlook from the dressing-room window.
There was Guy, leaj^ing, bounding, racing, rolling the dog
over, tripping him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) up, twitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ears, tickling his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feet,
catching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tail, laughing at Bustle's springs, contortions,
and harmless open-mouthed attacks, while the dog did little less
than laugh too, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intelligent amber eyes, and black and
red mouth. Charles began to find a new interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) listless
life in the attempt to draw Guy out, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) give one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) merry laughs. In this, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) failed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wit



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 23

<p/>consisted in allusions to the novels of the day, of which Guy
knew nothing. One morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) underwent a regular examin-
ation, ending in --

<p/>' Have you read anything ? '

<p/>' I am afraid I am very ignorant of modern books.''

<p/>' Have you read the ancient ones ? ' asked Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've had nothing else to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Nothing to read but ancient books ! ' exclaimed Amabel, with
a mixture of pity and astonishment.

<p/>' Sanchoniathon, Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus ! '
said Guy, smiling.

<p/>' There, Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has the Vicar of Wakefield
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ancient books, you need not pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is like Philip,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was brought up on the old
standard books, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) time being frittered away on the
host of idle modern ones.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was free to concentrate his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) attention on Sir Charles
Grandison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>' How could any one do so ? ' said Guy. ' How could anv one
have any sympathy with such a piece of self-satisfaction ?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who could? Eh, Laura?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>' I never read it,'' said Laura, suspecting malice.

<p/>' What is your opinion of perfect heroes 1 ' continued Charles.

<p/>' Here comes one,'' whispered Amy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother, blushing at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) piece of naughtiness, as Philip Morville entered the room.

<p/>After the first greetings and inquiries after his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sister, whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been visiting, Laura told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) what they had been saying
of the advantage of a scanty range of reading.

<p/>' True,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' I have often been struck by finding how
ignorant people are, even of Shakspeare ; and I believe the blame
chiefly rests on the cheap rubbish in which Charlie is nearly
walled up there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ay,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' and who haunts that rubbish at the be-
ginning of every month 1 I suppose to act as pioneer, though
whether any one but Laura heeds his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) warnings, remains to be
proved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Laura does heed ? ' asked Philip, well pleased.

<p/>' I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) read me the part of Dombey that hurts women's
feelings most, just to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would go on -- the part about
little Paul -- and I declare, I shall think the worse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ever
after -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was so stony hearted, that to this day she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) does not
know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) is dead or alive.''

<p/>' I can't quite say I don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) lived or died,<div class="bookquote">''
said Laura, ' for I found Amy in a state that alarmed me, crying
in the green-house, and I was very glad to find it was nothing-
worse than little Paul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' I wish you would have read it,'' said Amy ; and looking shyly
at Guy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) added -- ' Won't you ? '

<p/>' Well done, Amy ! ' said Charles. ' In the very face of the
young man's companion ! '



<p/>24 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Philip does not really think it wrong,'' said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip; `those books open fields of thought; and
as their principles are negative, they are not likely to hurt a
person well armed with the truth.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `that Guy and Laura have your
gracious permission to read Dombey.''

<p/>' When Laura has a cold or toothache.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' I am not sure about the expediency for you,'' said Philip ;
`it would be a pity to begin with Dickens, when there is so
much of a higher grade equally new to you. I suppose you do
not understand Italian ? '

<p/>' No,'' said Guy, abruptly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dark eyebrows contracted.

<p/>Philip went on. <div class="bookquote">``If you did, I should not recommend you
the translation of / jy^omessi Spo8% one of the most beautiful
books in any language. You have it in English, I think, Laura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura fetched it; Guy, with a constrained `thank you,'' was
going to take it up, rather as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was putting a force upon
himself, when Philip more quickly took the first volume, and
eagerly turned over the pages -- <div class="bookquote">``I can't stand this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said,
' where is the original % '

<p/>It was soon produced ; and Philip, finding the beautiful his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)-
tory of Fra Crist of oro, began to translate it fluently and with
an admirable choice of language that silenced Charles's attempts
to interrupt and criticise. Soon Guy, who had at first lent only
reluctant attention, was entirely absorbed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyebrows relaxed,
a look of earnest interest succeeded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) countenance softened,
and when Fra Cristof oro humbled himself , exchanged forgiveness,
and received it pane del 2-RRB-erdono^ tears hung on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyelashes.

<p/>The chapter was finished, and with a smothered exclamation
of admiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) joined the others in begging Pliilip to proceed.
The story thus read was very unlike what it had been to Laura
and Amy, when they puzzled it out as an Italian lesson, or to
Charles, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) carelessly tossed over the translation in search
of Don Abbondio's humours ; and thus between reading and
conversation, the morning passed very agreeably.

<p/>At luncheon, Mr. Edmonstone asked Philip to come and spend
a day or two at Holly well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) accepted the invitation for the
next week. ' I will make Thorndale drive me out if you will
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a dinner.''

<p/>' Of course, of course,'' said Mr. Edmonstone, ' we shall be
delighted. We were talking of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), a day or two ago ;
eh, mamma 1 '

<p/>' Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' a family party is an especial treat
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>laying a particular stress on the word ' family party,''
and looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>At that moment the butler came in, saying, ' Sir Guy's servant
is come, and has brought the horse, sir.''

<p/>' Deloraine come ! ' cried Guy, springing up. ' Where % '
<div class="bookquote">``At the door, sir.''



 (<font color='red'><b>REDCLYFFE Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 25

<p/>Guy darted out, Mr. Edmonstone following. In another
instant, however, Guy put his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head into the room again. ' Mrs,
Edmonstone, won't you come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? Philip, you have not
seen Deloraine.''

<p/>Off he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rushed, and the others were just in time to see the
cordial look of honest gladness with which William, the groom,
received his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) young master's greeting, and the delighted recog-
nition between Guy, Bustle, and Deloraine. Guy had no atten-
tion for anything else till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had heard how they had prospered
on the journey ; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) friend's ad-
miration for the beautiful chestnut, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather's birthday
present. The ladies admired with earnestness that compensated
for want of knowledge, the gentlemen with greater science and
discrimination; indeed, Philip, as a connoisseur, could not but,
for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own reputation, discover something to criticise.
Guy's brows drew together again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes glanced as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was much inclined to resent the remarks, as attacks at once on
Deloraine and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said nothing, and pre-
sently went to the stable with Mr. Edmonstone, to see about the
horse's accommodations. Philip stood in the hall with the ladies.

<p/>' So I perceive you have dropped the title already,'' observed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to Laura.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, replying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter, ' it
seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pain by reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) loss, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was so strange and forlorn just at first, that we were glad to do
what we could to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feel himself more at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then you get on pretty well now ? '

<p/>The reply was in chorus with variations -- ' Oh, excellently ! '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is so entertaining,'' said Charlotte.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sings so beautifully,'' said Amabel.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is so right-minded,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' So very Avell informed,'' said Laura.

<p/>Then it all began again.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) plays chess so well,'' said Amy.

<p/>' Bustle is such a dear dog,'' said Charlotte.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is so attentive to Charlie,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, going
into the drawing-room to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) son.

<p/>' Papa says he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will make up for the faults of all liis ancestors,''
said Amabel.

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) music ! oh, his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) music ! ' said Laura.

<p/>' Philip,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte, earnestly, ' you really should learn to
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Learn, impertinent little puss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, smiling, `why
should I not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) V

<p/>' I was sure you would try,'' said Charlotte, impressively.

<p/>' Is it hard ? ' said Amy. ' But, oh, Philip ! you could not help
liking his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) singing.''

<p/>' I never heard such a splendid voice,'' said Laura ; ' so clear
and powerful, and yet so wonderfully sweet in the low soft notes.
And a very fine ear : he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has a real talent for music'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All ! inherited, poor fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, compassionately.

<p/>' Do you pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for it ? ' said Amy, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you forget?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I would not advise you to
make much of this talent in public ; it is too much a badge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) descent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma did not think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought it a
pity he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should not learn regularly, with such a talent ; so the
other day, when Mr. Radford was giving us a lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) asked
Guy just to sing up and down the scale. I never saw anything
so funny as old Mr. Radford's surprise, it was almost like the
music lesson in La Figlia del Reggimento ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Radford</b></font>) started, and looked
at Guy, and seemed in a perfect transport, and now Guy is to
take regular lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Indeed.''

<p/>' But do you really mean,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' that if your mother
had been a musician's daughter, and you had inherited her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) talent,
that you would be ashamed of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Indeed, Laura,'' said Philip, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``I am equally far
from guessing what I should do if my mother had been aiwthing
but what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, as from guessing what I should do if I had a
talent for music'

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone here called her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughters to get ready for
their walk, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) intended to go to East-hill, and they might
as well walk with Philip as far as their roads lay together.

<p/>Philip and Laura walked on by themselves, a little in advance
of the others. Laura was very anxious to arrive at a right
understanding of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin's opinion of Guy.

<p/>' I am sure there is much to like in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said.

<p/>' There is ; but is it the highest praise to say there is much to
like ? People are not so cautious when they accept a man in totoJ

<p/>' Then, do you not ? '

<p/>Philip's answer was --

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) who the lion's whelp has nurst,
At home with fostering hand,
Finds it a gentle thing at first,
Obedient to command.''

<p/>' Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a lion's whelp ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I saw the lion just now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) flashing eyes and
contracted brow. There is an impatience of advice, a vehemence
of manner that I can hardly deem satisfactory. I do not speak
from prejudice, for I think highly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) candour, warmth of
heart, and desire to do right ; but from all I have seen, I should
not venture as yet to place much dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) steadiness
of character or command of temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seems to have been very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grandfather, in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) severity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is but just beginning to brighten up a little.''

<p/>' Yes ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disposition is very affectionate, -- almost a misfortune
to one so isolated from family ties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) showed remarkably well
at Redclyffe, the other day ; boyish of course, and without mucli
self-command, but very amiably. It is very well for liim that



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 27

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is removed from thence, for all the people idolize him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to such
a degree that they could not fail to spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>* It would be a great pity if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went wrong.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) has many admirable qualities, but still they
are just what persons are too apt to fancy compensation for
faults. 1 never heard that any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) family, except perhaps
that unhappy old Hugh, were deficient in frankness and gener-
osity, and therefore these do not satisfy me. Observe, I am not
condemning him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) : I wish to be perfectly just ; all I say is, that
I do not trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) till I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura did not answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was disappointed ; yet there was a
justice and guardedness in what Philip said, that made it
impossible to gainsay it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confidence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought how cool and prudent he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was, and how grieved she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
should be if Guy justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) doubts ; and so they walked on in
such silence as is perhaps the strongest proof of intimacy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
was the first to speak, led to do so by an expression of sadness
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin's mouth. ' What are you thinking of, Philip ? '

<p/>' Of Locksley Hall. There is nonsense, there is affectation in
that, Laura ; there is scarcely poetry, but there is power, for
there is truth.''

<p/>' Of Locksley Hall ! I thought you were at Stylehurst.''

<p/>' So I was, but the one brings the other.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you went to Stylehurst while you were at St.
Mildred's ? Did Margaret take you there 1 '

<p/>' Margaret ? Not she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is too much engaged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) book-
club, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) soirees, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) societies of every sort and kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>' How did you get on with the Doctor 1 '

<p/>' I saw as little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as I could, and was still more convinced
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) does not know what conversation is. Hem ! ' Philii^
gave a deep sigh. ' No ; the only thing to be done at St. Mil-
dred's is to walk across the moors to Stylehurst. It is a strange
thing to leave that tumult of gossip, and novelty, and hardness,
and to enter on that quiet autumnal old world, with the yellow
leaves floating silently down, just as they used to do, and the
atmosphere of stillness round the green churchyard.''

<p/>' Gossip ! ' repeated Laura. ' Surely not with Margaret ? '

<p/>' Literary, scientific gossip is worse than gossip in a primary
sense, without pretension.''

<p/>' I am glad you had Stylehurst to go to. How was the old
sexton's wife ? '

<p/>' Very well ; trotting about on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pattens as merrily as ever.''

<p/>' Did you go into the garden ? '

<p/>' Yes ; Fanny's ivy has entirely covered the south wall, and
tlie acacia is so tall and spreading, that I longed to have the
pruning of it. Old Will keeps everything in its former state.''

<p/>They talked on of the old home, till the stern bitter look of
regret and censure had faded from his (<font color='blue'><b>sexton</b></font>) brow, and given way to
a softened melancholy expression.

<p/>A fig for all dactyls, a fig for all spondees,

<p/>A fig for all dunces and dominie grandees.- -Scott

<p/>' How glad I am ! ' exclaimed Guy, entering the drawing-room.

<p/>' Wherefore 1 ' inquired Charles.

<p/>' I thought I was too late, and I am very glad to find no one
arrived, and Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone not come down.''

<p/>' But where have you been ? '

<p/>' I lost my Avay on the top of the down ; I fancied some one
told me there was a view of the sea to be had there.''

<p/>' And can't you exist without a view of the sea 1 '

<p/>Guy laughed. ' Everything looks so dull -- it is as if the view
was dead or imprisoned -- walled up by wood and hill, and
wanting that living ripple, heaving and struggling.''

<p/>``And your fine rocks f' said Laura.

<p/>' I wish you could see the Shag stone, -- a great island mass,
sloping on one side, precipitous on the other, with the spray
dashing on it. If you see it from ever so far ofi<div class="bookquote">'', there is still
that white foam coming and going -- a glancing speck, like the
light in an eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Hark ! a carriage.''

<p/>' The young man and the young man's companion,'' said Charles.

<p/>' How can you *? ' said Laura. ' What would any one suppose
Mr. Thorndaletober

<p/>' Not Philip's valet,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' if it is true that no man
is a hero to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) valley-de-shain ; whereas, what is not Philip to
the Honourable James Thorndale '' (<font color='red'><b>Thorndaletober Philip valet</b></font>)</div>? ' _

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip, Alexander, and Bucephalus into the bargain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>sug-
gested Amy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) demure, frightened whisper, sending all but
Laura into a fit of laughter, the harder to check because the \
steps of the parties concerned were heard approaching.

<p/>Mr. Thorndale was a quiet individual, one of those of whom
there is least to be said, so complete a gentleman that it would
have been an insult to call him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gentleman-like ; agreeable and
clever rather than otherwise, good-looking, with a high-bred air
about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), so that it always seemed strange that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not
make more impression.

<p/>A ring at the front-door almost immediately followed their
arrival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Encore?''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>asked Philip, looking at Laura with a sort of
displeased surprise.

<p/>' Unfortunately, yes,'' said Laum, drawing aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One of my uncle's family parties,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I wish
I had not brought Thorndale. Laura, what is to be done to

<p/>' Some game ? ' said Laura. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) signed approval ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 29

<p/>time to say no more, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father and mother came down, and
some more guests entered.

<p/>It was just such a party as continually grew up at Holly well,
for Mr, Edmonstone was so fond of inviting, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife never
knew in the morning how many would assemble at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) table in
the evening. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was used to it, and too good a manager
even to be called so. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)-
self in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) good-natured, open-hearted way. The change was
good for Charles, and thus it did very well, and there were few
houses in the neighbourhood more popular than Holly well.

<p/>The guests this evening were Maurice de Courcy, a wild
young Irishman, all noise and nonsense, a great favourite with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) cousin, Mr. Edmonstone ; two Miss Harpers, daughters of the
late clergyman, good-natured, second-rate girls ; Dr. Mayerne,
Charles's kind old physician, the friend and much-loved coun-
sellor at Hollywell, and the present vicar, Mr. Eoss, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Eoss</b></font>)
daughter Mary.

<p/>Mary Ross was the greatest friend that the Miss Edmonstones
possessed, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) being five-and-twenty, they had not
arrived at perceiving that they were on the equal terms of
youngladyhood.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) mother early, and had owed a great deal to
the kindness of Mrs. Edmonstone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) grew up among her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
numerous elder brothers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had no girlhood ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was a boy
till fourteen, and then a woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was scarcely altered
since the epoch of that transition, the same in likings, tastes,
and duties. ' Papa ' was all the world to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and pleasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>)
had much the same meaning now as then ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) brothers were
like jDlayfellows ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) delights were still a lesson in Greek from
papa, a school-children's feast, a game at play, a new book. It
was only a pity other people did not stand still too. ' Papa,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>indeed, had never grown sensibly older since the year of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
mother's death : but her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brothers were whiskered men, with all
the cares of the world, and no holidays ; the school-girls went
out to service, and were as a last year's brood to an old hen ;
the very children she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had fondled were young ladies, as old, to
all intents and purposes, as herself, and here were even Laura
and Amy Edmonstone fallen into that bad habit of growing up !
though little Amy had still much of the kitten in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) composi-
tion, and could play as well as Charlotte or Mary herself, when
they had the garden to themselves.

<p/>Mary took great pains to amuse Charles, always walking to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in the worst weather, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought other visitors
likely to fail, and chatting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was the idlest
person in the world, though the quantity she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did at home and
in the parish would be too amazing to be recorded. Spirited
and decided, without superfluous fears and fineries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a
tall, firm, robust figure, and a rosy, good-natured face, with a
manner that, though perfectly feminine, had in it an air of
strength and determination.



<p/>30 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Holly well was a hamlet, two miles from the parish church of
East-hill, and Mary had thus seen very little of the Edmon-
stone's guest, having only been introduced to him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) after church
on Sunday. The pleasure on which Charles chiefly reckoned
for that evening was the talking him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) over with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wlien the
ladies came in from the dining-room. The Miss Harpers, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sisters, gathered round the piano, and Mrs. Edmonstone sat
at Charles's feet, while Mary knitted and talked.

<p/>' So you get on well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is one of those people who are never in the way, and yet
you never can forget their presence,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) manners are quite the pink of courtesy,'' said Mary.

<p/>' Like his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grandfather<div class="bookquote">``s,''  (<font color='red'><b>grandfather</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' that old-
school deference and attention is very chivalrous, and sits
prettily and quaintly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) high spirits and animation ; I hope
it will not wear ofl^.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A vain hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``At present he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) is like that
German myth, Kaspar Hauser, who lived till twenty in a cellar.
It is lucky for mamma that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hauser</b></font>) green state, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hauser</b></font>) is courtly
instead of bearish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' Lucky for you, too, Charlie ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spoils you finely.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has the rare perfection of letting me know my own mind.
I never knew what it was to have my own way before.''

<p/>' Is that your complaint, Charlie ? What next 1 ' said Mary.

<p/>' So you think I have my way, do you, Mary ? That is all
envy, you see, and very much misplaced. Could you guess what
a conflict it is every time I am helped up that mountain of
a staircase, or the slope of my sofa is altered ? Last time Philip
stayed here, every step cost an argument, till at last, through
sheer exhaustion, I left myself a deadweight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands, to be
carried up by main strength. And after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is such a great,
strong fellow, that I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not mind it ; so next time
I crutched myself down alone, and I hoiDe that did provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>' Sir Guy is so kind that I am ashamed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.
' It seems as if we had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for the sole purpose of
waiting on Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half his (<font color='blue'><b>Hauser</b></font>) heart is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hauser</b></font>) horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Never had
man such delight in the ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>brute creation.'' '

<p/>' They have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chief playfellows,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.
' The chief of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) time was spent in wandering in the woods or
on the beach, watching them and their ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>chief</b></font>)</div><p/>' I fairly dreamt of that Elysium of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) last night,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles :
'a swamp half frozen on a winter's night, full of wild ducks.
Here, Charlotte, come and tell Mary the roll of Guy's pets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte began. ' There was the sea-gull, and the hedgehog,
and the fox, and the badger, and the jay, and the monkey, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) bought because it was dying, and cured it, only it died the
next winter, and a toad, and a raven, and a squirrel, and '

<p/>' That will do, Charlotte.''

<p/>* Oh 1 but Mary has not heard the names of all his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) dogs.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 31

<p/>And, Mary, he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) has cured Bustle of hunting my Puss, We held
them up to each other, and Puss hissed horribly, but Bustle did
not mind it a bit ; and the other day, when Charles tried to set
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would not take the least notice.''

<p/>' Now, Charlotte,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand, with a pro-
voking mock politeness, ' have the goodness to return to your
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Tea over, Laura proposed the game of definitions. *You
know it, Philip,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), `you taught us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, I learnt it of your sisters, Thorndale,'' said Philip.

<p/>' O pray let us have it. It must be charming ! ' exclaimed
Miss Harper, on this recommendation.

<p/>' Definitions ! ' said Charles, contemptuously. ' Dr. Johnson
must be the hand for them.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are just the definitions not to be found in Johnson,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thorndale</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Thorndale. ' Our standing specimen is adversity, which
may be differently explained according to your taste, as <div class="bookquote">'' a toad
with a precious jewel in its head,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">'' the test of friendship.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>* The spirit of words,'' said Guy, looking eager and interested.

<p/>' Well, we'll try,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' though I can't say it sounds
to me promising. Come, Maurice, define an Irishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No, no, don't let us be personal,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ; ' I had thought
of the word happiness. We are each to write a definition on
a slip of paper, then compare them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The game was carried on with great spirit for more than an
hour. It was hard to say which made most fun, Maurice,
Charles, or Guy ; the last no longer a spectator, but an active
contributor to the sport. When the break-up came, Mary and
Amabel were standing over the table together, collecting the
scattered papers, and observing that it had been very good fun.
' Some so characteristic,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' such as Maurice's definition
of happiness, -- a row at Dublin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Some were very deep, though,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mary ; ' if it is not treason,
I should like to make^ out whose that other was of happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You mean this,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy : ' ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gleams from a brighter world,
too soon eclipsed or forfeited.<div class="bookquote">'' I thought it was Philip's, but it
is Sir Guy's writing. How very sad ! I should not like to think
so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so merry all the time ! This is his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), too, I see ;
this one about riches being the freight for which the traveller
is responsible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a great deal of character in them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div>said Mary.
' I should not have wondered at any of us, penniless people,
philosophizing in the fox and grapes style, but for him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>), and at
his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) age '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) has been brought up so as to make the theory of wisdom
come early,'' said Philip, who was nearer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought.

<p/>' Is that intended for disparagement ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked quickly.

<p/>* I think very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has a great deal of sense and
right feeling,'' was Philip's sedate answer ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turned away
to say some last words to Mr. Thorndale.



<p/>32 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>The Rosses were the last to depart, Mary in cloak and clogs,
while Mr. Edmonstone lamented that it was in vain to offer
the carriage ; and Mary laughed, and thanked, and said the
walk home with Papa was the greatest of treats in the frost
and star-light.

<p/>' Don't I pity you, who always go out to dinner in a carriage ! '
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) last words to Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, `how do you like it?''

<p/>* Very much, indeed. It was very pleasant.''

<p/>' You are getting into the fairy ring,'' said Laura, smiling.

<p/>' Ay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) said, smiling too ; ' but it does not turn to tinsel.
Would it if I saw more of it ? ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) looked at Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be no compliment to ourselves to say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose tinsel or gold depends on the using,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>),
thoughtfully ; ' there are some lumps of solid gold among
those papers, I am sure, one, in particular, about a trifle. May
I see that again 1 I mean --

<p/>* Little things
On little wings
Bear little souls to heaven.''

<p/>* Oh ! that was only a quotation,'' said Amy, turning over the
definitions again with him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), and laughing at some of tlie most
amusing ; while, in the mean time, Philip went to help Laura,
who was putting some books away in the ante-room.

<p/>' Yes, Laura,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has thought, mind, and soul ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is
no mere rattle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No indeed. Who could help seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) superiority over
Maurice 1 '

<p/>' If only he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does not pervert his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gifts, and if it is not all talk.
I don't like such excess of openness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feelings ; it is too
like talking for talking's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma says it is the transparency of youthfulness. You
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has never been at school ; so his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thoughts come out in

it is very late. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>The frost turned to rain the next morning, and the torrents
streamed against the window, seeming to have a kind of attrac-
tion for Philip and Guy, who stood watching them.

<p/>Guy wondered if the floods would be out at Redclyffe ; and liis
cousins were interested by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) description of the sudden, angry
rush of the mountain streams, eddying fiercely along, bearing
with them tree and rock ; while the valleys became lakes, and
the little mounds islets ; and the trees looked strangely out of
proportion when only their branches were visible, ' Oh ! a great
flood is famous fun,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>' Surely,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' I have heard a legend of your being
nearly drowned in some flood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' I had a tolerable ducking.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 33

<p/>' Oh, tell us about it ! ' said Amy.

<p/>' Ay ! I have a curiosity to hear a personal experience of
drowning,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles. ' Come, begin at the beginning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I was standing watching the tremendous force of the stream,
when I saw an unhappy old ram floating along, bleating so
piteously, and making such absurd, helpless struggles, that I
could not help pulling off my coat and jumping in after him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
It was very foolish, for the stream was too strong -- I was two
years younger then. Moreover, the beast was very heavy, and
not at all grateful for any kind intentions, and I found mysell;
sailing off to the sea, with the prospect of a good many rocks
before long ; but just then an old tree stretched out its friendly
arms through the water ; it stopped the sheep, and I caught
hold of the branches, and managed to scramble up, while my
friend got entangled in them with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wool ' --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Omne quum Proteus pecus egit altos
Visere montes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>quoted Philip.

<p/>' Ovium et sumniA genus haesit ulmo,''
added Guy.

<p/>' Oviiim,'' exclaimed Philip, with a face of horror. ' Don't you
know that in Ovis is short 1 Do anything but take liberties
with Horace ! '

<p/>' Get out of the tree first, Guy,'' said Charles, ' for at present
your history seems likely to end with a long ohone ! '

<p/>' Well, Triton -- not Proteus-- came to the rescue at last,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Guy, laughing ; ' I could not stir, and the tree bent so fright-
fully with the current that I expected every minute we should
all go together ; so I had nothing for it but to halloo as loud as
I could. No one heard but Triton, the old Newfoundland dog,
who presently came swimming up, so eager to help, poor fellow,
that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have throttled me, or hurt himself in
the branches. I took off my handkerchief and threw it to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),
telling him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to take it to Arnaud, who I knew would understand
it as a signal of distress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Triton Proteus</b></font>)</div><p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) 1 How long had you to wait 1 '

<p/>' I don't know -- it seemed long enough before a most welcome
boat appeared, with some men in it, and Triton in an agony.
They would never have found me but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>), for my voice was
gone ; indeed the next thing I remember was lying on the grass
in the park, and Markham saying, ' Well, sir, if you do wish to
throw away your life, let it be for something better worth
saving than Farmer Holt's vicious old ram ! '

<p/>' In the language of the great Mr. Toots,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' I am
afraid you got very wet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div><p/>' Were you the worse for it 1 ' said Amy.

<p/>' Not in the least. I was so glad to hear it was Holt's ! for
you must know that I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt. 1
had been very angry at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holt</b></font>) beating our old hound, for, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holt</b></font>)
thought, worrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Holt</b></font>) sheep ; not that Dart ever did, though/

<p/>' And was the ram saved 1 '

<p/>' Yes, and next time I saw it, it nearly knocked me down.

<p/>' Would you do it again 1 ' said Philip.

<p/>' I don't know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you had a medal from the Humane Society/ said
Charles.

<p/>' That would have been more proper for Triton.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yours should have been an ovation,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, cutting
the o absurdly short, and looking at Philip.

<p/>Laura saw that the spirit of teasing was strong in Charles
this morning, and suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to stir up what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
called the deadly feud, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hastened to change the con-
versation by saying, <div class="bookquote">``You quite impressed Guy with your
translation of Fra Cristoforo.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Indeed I must thank you for recommending the book/ said
Guy ; ' how beautiful it is ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you entered into it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip; `it has every
quality that a fiction ought to have.''

<p/>' I never read anything equal to the repentance of the name-
less man.''

<p/>' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) your favourite character ? ' said Philip, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
attentively.

<p/>' Oh no -- of course not -- though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is so grand that one thinks
most about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but no one can be cared about as much as
Lucia.''

<p/>* Lucia ! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never struck me as more than a well-painted
peasant girl,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Oh ! ' cried Guy, indignantly ; then controlling himself, ho
continued : ' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pretends to no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is, but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shows
the beauty of goodness in itself in a -- a -- wonderful way. And
think of the power of those words of hers over that gloomy,
desperate man.''

<p/>' Your sympathy with the Innominate again,'' said Philip.

<p/>Every subject seemed to excite Guy to a dangerous extent,
as Laura thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) turned to Philip to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would
not read to them again.

<p/>' I brought this book on purpose,'' said Philip. ' I wished to
read you a description of that print from Rafiaelle -- you know
it -- the Madonna di San Sisto ? '

<p/>' The one you brought to show us ? ' said Amy, ' with the two
little angels V

<p/>' Yes, here is the description,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began to read --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dwell on the form of the Child, more than human in
grandeur, seated on the arms of the Blessed Virgin as on an
august throne. Note the tokens of divine grace. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ardent
eyes, what a spirit, what a countenance is His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; yet His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) very
resemblance to His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother denotes sufficiently that He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is of
us and takes care for us. Beneath are two figures adoring,
each in their own manner. On one side is a pontiff, on the
oilier a virgin, each a most sweet and solemn example, the one

<p/>of aged, the other of maidenly piety and reverence. Between,
are two winged boys, evidently presenting a wonderful pattern
of childlike piety. Their eyes, indeed, are not turned towards
the Virgin, but both in face and gesture, they show how careless
of themselves they are in the presence of God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>angels</b></font>)</div><p/>All were struck by the description. Guy did not speak at
first, but the solemn expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face showed how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt
its power and reverence. Philip asked if they would like to
hear more, and Charles assented : Amy worked, Laura went on
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) perspective, and Guy sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) side, making concentric
circles with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) compasses, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wanted them he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tor-
mented her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) parallel ruler, or cut the pencils, never letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
fingers rest except at some high or deep passage, or when some
interesting discussion arose. All were surprised when luncheon
time arrived ; Charles held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand for the book ; it was
given with a slight smile, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) exclaimed : ' Latin ! I thought
you were translating. Is it your own property 1 '

<p/>' Yes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it very tough? I would read it, if any one would read
it with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you mean me ? ' said Guy ; ' I should like it very much,
but you have seen how little Latin I know.''

<p/>' That is the very thing,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' that Ovis of yours
was music ; I would have made you a Knight of the Golden
Fleece on the spot. Tutors I could get by shoals, but a fellow-
dunce is inestimable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is a bargain, then,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' if Philip has done with the
book and will lend it to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The luncheon bell rang, and they all adjourned to the dining-
room. Mr. Edmonstone came in when luncheon was nearly over,
rejoicing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) letters were done, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) looked discon-
solately from the window, and pitied the weather. ' Nothing for
it but billiards. People might say it was nonsense to have a
billiard-table in such a house, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) part he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) found there was
no getting through a wet day without them. Philip must beat
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as usual, and Guy might have one of the young ladies to
make a fourth.''

<p/>' Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' but I don't play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not play -- eh ? Well, we will teach you in the spinning of a
ball, and I'll have my little Amy to help me against you and
Philip.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>repeated Guy, colouring, <div class="bookquote">``I am under a
promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ha! Eh? What? Your grandfather? He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) could see no
harm in such play as this. For nothing, you understand. You
did not suppose I meant anything else ? '

<p/>' O no, of course not,<div class="bookquote">'' eagerly replied Guy ; ' but it is impos-
sible for me to play, thank you, I have promised never even to
look on at a game at billiards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had too much reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>muttered Mr.

<p/>Edmonstone to himself, but catching a warning look from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) became suddenly silent. Guy, meanwhile, sat looking
lost in sad thoughts, till, rousing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed, ' Don't
let me prevent you.''

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone needed but little persuasion, and carried
Philip off to the billiard- table in the front hall.

<p/>' O, I am so glad ! ' cried Charlotte, wlio had, within the last
week, learnt Guy's value as a playfellow. ' Now you will never
go to those stupid billiards, but I shall have you always, every
rainy day. Come and have a real good game at ball on the
stairs.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) already had hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, and would have dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
off at once, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not waited to help Charles back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sofa ;
and in the mean time she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tried in vain to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) more con-
stant playmate, Amabel, to join the game. Poor little Amy
regretted the being obliged to refuse, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) listened to the merry
sounds and bouncing balls, sighing more than once at having
turned into a grown-up young lady ; while Philip observed to
Laura, who was officiating as billiard-marker, that Guy was still
a mere boy.

<p/>^ The fates favoured Amy at last, for about half after three, the
billiards were interrupted, and Philip, pronouncing the rain to
be almost over, invited Guy to take a walk, and they set out in
a very gray wet mist, while Charlotte and Amy commenced a
vigorous game at battledore and shuttle-cock.

<p/>The gray mist had faded into twilight, and twilight into some-
thing like night, when Charles was crossing the hall, with the aid
of Amy's arm, Charlotte carrying the crutch behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and
Mrs. Edmonstone helping Laura with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) perspective apparatus,
all on their way to dress for dinner ; the door opened and in came
the two Morvilles. Guy, without even stopping to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
great coat, ran at once up-stairs, and the next moment the door
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) room was shut with a bang that shook the house, and made
them all start and look at Philip for explanation.

<p/>' Redely fFe temper,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), coolly, with a half -smile curling
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) short upper lip.

<p/>' What have you been doing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ? ' said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. At least nothing worthy of such ire. I only
entered on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Oxford life, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to pre-
pare for it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) education has as yet been a mere farce. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
used to go two or three days in the week to one Potts, a self-
educated genius -- a sort of superior writing-master at the Moor-
worth commercial school. Of course, though it is no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>),
poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) is hardly up to the fifth form, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) must make
the most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) time, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) is not to be plucked. I set all this
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) as gently as I could, for I knew with whom I had to
deal, yet you see how it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) say ? ' asked Charles.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said nothing ; so far I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) credit ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) strode on
furiously for the last half mile, and this explosion is the finale.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 37

<p/>I am very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), poor boy ; I beg no further notice may
be taken of it. Don't you want an arm, Charlie ? '

<p/>' No thank you,'' answered Charles, with a little surliness.

<p/>' You had better. It really is too much for Amy,'' said Philip,
making a move as if to take possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arrived at
the foot of the stairs.

<p/>' Like the camellia, I suppose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) replied ; and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
other crutch from Charlotte, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began determinedly to ascend
without assistance, resolved to keep Philip a prisoner below him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could, and enjoying the notion of chafing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) by
the delay. Certainly teasing Philip was a dear delight to
Charles, though it was all on trust, as, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) succeeded, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
cousin never betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) annoyance by look or sign.

<p/>About a quarter of an hour after, there was a knock at the
dressing-room door. ' Come in,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking
up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) letter- writing, and Guy made his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) appearance, looking
very downcast.

<p/>' I am come,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, ' to ask pardon for the disturbance I made
just now. I was so foolish as to be irritated at Philip's manner,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was giving me some good advice, and I am very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' What has happened to your lip ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) handkerchief to it. ' Is it bleeding still ? It is a
trick of mine to bite my lip when I am vexed. It seems to help
to keep down words. There ! I have given myself a mark of
this hateful outbreak.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) looked very unhappy, more so, Mrs. Edmonstone thought,
than the actual offence required. ' You have only failed in part,<div class="bookquote">''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said. ' It was a ^dctory to keep down words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' The feeling is the tiling^ said Guy ; ' besides, I showed it
plainly enough, without speaking.''

<p/>' It is not easy to take advice from one so little your elder,<div class="bookquote">''
began Mrs. Edmonstone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). ' It was not
the advice. That was very good ; I -- ' but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke with an
effort, -- ' I am obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). It was -- no, I won't say what,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes kindling, then changing in a moment to a
sorrowful, resolute tone, ' Yes, but I ivill^ and then I shall make
myself thoroughly ashamed. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) veiled assumption of
superiority, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) contempt for all I have been taught. Just as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not every right to despise me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) talent and
scholarship, after such egregious mistakes as I had made in the
morning. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little reason to think highly of my attain-
ments ; but let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) slight me as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pleases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must not
slight those who taught me. It was not Mr. Potts' fault.''

<p/>Even the name could not spoil the spirited sound of the
speech, and Mrs. Edmonstone was full of sympathy. ' You must
remember,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said, ' that in the eyes of a man brought up at
a public school, nothing compensates for the want of the regular
classical education. I have no doubt it was very provoking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I don't want to be excused, thank you,'' said Guy. ' Oh ! I
am grieved ; for I tliought the worst of my temper had been

<p/>subdued. After all that has passed -- all I felt -- I thought it
impossible. Is there no hope for -- ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands, then recovering and turning to Mrs. Edmonstone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
said, ' It is encroaching too much on your kindness to come here
and trouble you with my confessions.''

<p/>' No, no, indeed,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), earnestly. ' Remember how we agreed
that you should come to me like one of my own children. And,
indeed, I do not see why you need grieve in this despairing way,
for you almost overcame the fit of anger ; and perhaps you were
off your guard because the trial came in an unex^Dected way ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It dicl, it did,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) said, eagerly; <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind being told
point blank that I am a dunce, but that Mr. Potts -- nay, by
imijlication -- my grandfather should be set at nought in that

<p/>cool But here I am again ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>), checking himself in

<p/>the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) vehemence ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) did not mean that, of course.
I have no one to blame but myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am sure,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, ' that if you always treat
your failings in this way, you must subdue them at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is all failing, and resolving, and failing again ! ' said Guy.

<p/>' Yes, but the failures become slighter and less frequent, and
the end is victory.''

<p/>' The end victory ! ' repeated Guy, in a musing tone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
stood leaning against the mantelshelf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to all who persevere and seek for help,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Edmonstone ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes and fixed them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) with
an earnest look that surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), for it was almost as if the
hope came home to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as something new. At that moment,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was called away, and directly after a voice in tlie
next room exclaimed, ' Are you there, Guy ? I want an arm ! '
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for the first time perceived that Charles's door was ajar.

<p/>Charles thought all this a great fuss about nothing, indeed lie
was glad to find there was anyone who had no patience with
Philip ; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) usual mischievous manner, totally reckless of
the fearful evil of interfering with the influence for good which
it was to be hoped that Philip might exert over Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke
thus : ' I begin to think the world must be more docile than I
have been disposed to give it credit for. How a certain cousin
of ours has escaped numerous delicate hints to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own
business is to me one of the wonders of the world.''

<p/>' No one better deserves that his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) advice should be followed,''
said Guy, with some constraint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An additional reason against it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``Plague on
that bell ! I meant to have broken through your formalities
and had a candid opinion of Don Philip before it rang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then I am glad of it ; I could hardly have given you a
candid opinion just at present.''

<p/>Charles was vexed ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) consoled himself by thinking that
Guy did not yet feel himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) leading-strings, and was
still on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good behaviour. After such a flash as this there was
no fear, but there was that in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) which would create mischief



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 39

<p/>and disturbance enough. Charles was well principled at the
bottom, and would have shrunk with horror had it been set
-RSB--RRB-efore him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) how dangerous might be the eifect of destroying the
chance of a friendship between Guy and the only person whose
guidance was likely to be beneficial to liim ; but Iiis idle, unoc-
cupied life, and habit of only thinking of things as they con-
cerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) immediate amusement, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ready to do anything
for the sake of opposition to Philip, and enjoy the vague idea of
excitement to be derived from anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's ward,
whom at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regarded with increased liking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
became certain that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) called the Puritan spirit was not
native to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>At dinner-time, Guy was as silent as on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first arrival, and
there Avould have been very little conversation had not the
other gentlemen talked politics, Philip leading the discussion to
bear upon the duties and prospects of landed proprietors, and
dwelling on the extent of their opportunities for doing good.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tried to get Guy's attention by speaking of Redclyffe, of the
large circle influenced by the head of the Morville family, and
of the hopes entertained by Lord Thorndale that this power
would prove a valuable support to the rightful cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
spoke in vain ; the young heir of Redclyfle made answers as
brief, absent, and indifferent, as if all this concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) no
more than the Emperor of Morocco, and Philip, mentally pro-
nouncing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sullen, turned to address himself to Laura.

<p/>As soon as the ladies had left the dining-room, Guy roused
himself, and began by saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guardian that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was afraid
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was very deficient in classical knowledge ; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
must work hard before going to Oxford ; and asked whether there
was any tutor in the neighbourhood to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could apply.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes, as much amazed as if Guy
had asked if there was any executioner in the neighbourhood
wlio could cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head. Philip was no less surprised, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) peace, thinking it was well Guy had sense enough
to. propose it voluntarily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would have suggested it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
uncle as soon as there was an opportunity of doing _ so in
private. As soon as Mr. Edmonstone had recollected himself,
and pronounced it to be exceedingly proper, &c., they entered
into a discussion on the neighbouring curates, and came at last
to a resolution that Philip should see whether Mr. Lascelles, a
curate of Broadstone, and an old schoolfellow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own, would
read with Guy a few hours in every week.

<p/>After this was settled, Guy looked relieved, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
not himself all the evening, and sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) old corner between
the plants and the window, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) read a grave book, instead
of talking, singing, or finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) volume of ' Ten Thousand
a- Year.'' Charlotte was all this time ill at ease. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looked
from Guy to Philip, from Philip to Guy ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mouth
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was forming some great resolve, then coloured, and
looked confused, rushing into the conversation with something



<p/>40 THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>more wxd-apropos than usual, as if on purpose to appear at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
ease. At last, just before her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) bed-time, when the tea was
coming in, Mrs. Edmonstone engaged with tliat, Laura reading.
Amy clearing Charles's little table, and Philip helping Mr.
Edmonstone to unravel the confused accounts of the late cheat-
ing bailiff, Guy suddenly found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), perusing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face with all the power of lier great blue eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) started
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked up, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face into Amabel's great myrtle,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would make it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was smelling to it.

<p/>' Well, Charlotte 1 ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) speak, but in a frightened, embarrassed whisper.

<p/>' Guy -- Guy -- Oh ! I beg your pardon, but I wanted to '

<p/>' Well, what ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), kindly.

<p/>' I wanted to make sure that you are not angry with Philip.
You don't mean to keep up the feud, do you 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Feud? -- I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, too much in earnest to be
diverted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lecture. ' I am very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' Are you really 1 ' said Charlotte, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head a little on one
side. ' I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been scolding you.''

<p/>Scolding was so very inappropriate to Philip's calm, argu-
mentative way of advising, that it became impossible not to
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not scolding, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``You are too nearly
grown up for that, but telling you to learn, and being tiresome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I was so foolish as to be provoked at first,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Guy ;
' but I hope I have thought better of it, and am going to act
upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes wider than ever, but in the midst
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) amazement Mrs. Edmonstone called to Guy to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
leafy screen and come to tea.

<p/>Philip was to return to Broadstone the next day, and as Mrs.
Edmonstone had some errands there that would occupy lier
longer than Charles liked to wait in the carriage, it was settled
that Philip should drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) there in the pony phaeton, and
Guy accompany them and drive back, thus having an ojDpor-
tunity of seeing Philip's print of the ' Madonna di San Sisto,''
returning some calls, and being introduced to Mr. Lascelles,
whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) was shopping. They appointed an hour and place
of meeting, and kept to it, after which Mrs. Edmonstone took
Guy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to call on Mrs. Deane, the wife of the colonel.

<p/>It was currently believed among the young Edmonstones,
that Mamma and Mrs. Deane never met without talking over
Mr. Morville's good qualities, and the present visit proved no
excei^tion. Mrs. Deane, a kind, open-hearted, elderly lady, was
very fond of Mr. Morville, and proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) as a credit to the
regiment ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) told several traits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) excellent judgment,
kindness of heart, and power of leading to the right course.
Mrs. Edmonstone listened, and replied with delight ; and no
less pleasure and admiration were seen reflected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) young
friend's radiant face.



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 41

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone's first question, as they set out on their
homeward drive, was, whether they had seen Mr. Lascelles ■?

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' I am to begin to-morrow, and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
every Monday and Thursday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' That is prompt.''

<p/>' Ah ! I have no time to lose ; besides, I have been leading
too smooth a life with you. I want something unpleasant to
keep me in order. Something famously horrid,'' repeated he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
smacking the whip with a relish, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would have applied
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could have found nothing else.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think you live too smoothly at HoUywell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Edmonstone, hardly able, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good
impulses, to help laughing at this strange boy.

<p/>' Yes. Happy, thoughtless, vehement ; that is what your
kindness makes me. Was it not a proof, that I must needs fly
out at such a petty provocation V

<p/>' I should not have thought it such a very exciting life ;
certainly not such as is usually said to lead to thoughtlessness ;
and we have been even quieter than usual since you came.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't know what stuff I am made of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy,
gravely, though smiling ; ' your own home party is enough to
do me harm ; it is so exceedingly pleasant.''

<p/>' Pleasant things do not necessarily do harm.''

<p/>' Not to you ; not to people who are not easily unsettled ;
but when I go up-stairs, after a talking, merry evening, such
as the night before last, I find that I have enjoyed it too much ;
I am all abroad ! I can hardly fix my thoughts, and I don't
know what to do, since here I must be, and I can't either be
silent, or sit up in my own room.''

<p/>' Certainly not,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), smiling ; ' there are duties of society
which you owe even to us dangerous people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No, no : don't misunderstand me. The fault is in myself.
If it was not for that, I could learn nothing but good,'' said
Guy, speaking very eagerly, distressed at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answer.

<p/>'1 believe I understand you,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), marvelling at the
serious, ascetic temper, coupled with the very high animal
spirits. ' For your comfort, I believe the unsettled feeling you
complain of is chiefly the effect of novelty. You have led so
very retired a life, that a lively family party is to you what
dissipation would be to other people ; and, as you must meet
the world some time or other, it is better the first encounter
with it should be in this comparatively innocent form. Go on
watching yourself, and it will do you no harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, but if I find it does me liarm ? It would be cowardly
to run away, and resistance should be from within. Yet, on
the other hand, there is the duty of giving up, wrenching one-
self from all that has temptation in it.''

<p/>' There is nothing,'' said Mrs, Edmonstone, ' that lias no tempt-
ation in it ; but I should think the rule was plain, if a duty
such as that of living among us for the present, and making



<p/>42 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>yourself moderately agreeable, involves temptations, they must
be met and battled from within. In the same way, your posi-
tion in society,^ with all its duties, could not be laid aside
because it is full of trial. Those who do such things are faint-
hearted, and fail in ti-ust in Him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) who lixed their station, and
finds room for them to deny themselves in the trivial round
and common task. It is pleasure involving no duty that should
be given up, if we find it liable to lead us astray.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>answered Guy, musingly; `and this reading comes
naturally, and is just what I wanted to keep the pleasant things
from getting a full hold of me. I ought to have thought of it
sooner, instead of dawdling a whole month in idleness. Then
all this would not have hajDpened. I hope it will be very tough.''

<p/>' You have no great love for Latin and Greek ? '

<p/>' Oh ! ' cried Guy, eagerly, ' to be sure I delight in Homer and
the Georgics, and plenty more. What splendid things there
are in these old fellows ! But I never liked the drudgery part
of the affair ; and now if I am to be set to work to be accurate,
and to get up all the grammar and tlie Greek roots, it will be
horrid enough in all conscience.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) groaned as deeply as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Homer</b></font>) had not been congratulating
himself just before on the difficulty.

<p/>' Who was your tutor ? ' asked Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Mr, Potts,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is a very clever man : he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had a
common grammar-school education, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) struggled on -- taught
himself a great deal -- and at last thought it great promotion to
be a teacher at the Commercial Academy, as they call it, at
Moorwortli, where Markham's nephews went to school. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is
very clever, I assure you, and very patient of the hard, wearing
life he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) must have of it there • and oh ! so enjoying a new book,
or an afternoon to himself. When I was about eiglit or nine, I
began with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), riding into Moorwortli three times in a week ;
and I have gone on ever since. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has done the
best he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could for me ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) made the readings very pleasant
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) own enjoyment. If Philip had known the difficulties
that man has struggled through, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) beautiful temper, per-
severing in doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) best and being contented, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
could never have spoken contemjDtuously of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Potts/Potts</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone; `all he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
meant was, that a person without a university education can-
not tell what the requirements are to which a man must come
up in these days.''

<p/>' Ah ! ' said Guy, laughing, ' how I wished Mr. Potts had been
there to have enjoyed listening to Pliilip and Mr. Lascelles
discussing some new Lexicon, digging down for roots of words,
and quoting passages of obscure Greek poets at such a rate,
that if my eyes had been shut I could have thought them two
withered old students in spectacles and snuff-coloured coats.''

<p/>' Philip was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) element,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>proceeded Guy, with animation, `the more I hear



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 43

<p/>and see of Philip, the more I wonder. What a choice collection
of books he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has -- so many of them school prizes, and how beauti-
fully bound ! '

<p/>' Ah ! that is one of Philip's peculiar ways. Witli all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
prudence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love of books, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not buy one
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a reasonable prospect of being able to dress it
handsomely. Did you see the print ? '

<p/>' Yes, that I did. What glorious loveliness ! There is no-
thing that does it justice but the description in the lecture.
Oil ! I forgot, you liave not heard it. You must let me read
it to you bv and by. Those two little angels, what faces they
have. Perfect innocence -- one full of reasoning, the other of
unreasoning adoration ! '

<p/>' I see it ! ' suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' I see what
you are like in one of your looks, not by any means in all -- it is
to the larger of those two angels.''

<p/>' Very seldom, I should guess,'' said Guy ; and sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
voice, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was communicating a most painful fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
added, ``My real likeness is old Sir Hugh's portrait at home.
But what were we saying ? Oh ! about Philip. How nice those
stories were of Mrs. Deane<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Deane/Deane</b></font>)</div><p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' To have won so much esteem and admiration already from
strangers, with no prejudice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) favour. -- It must be entirely
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own doing ; and well it may ! Every time one hears of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
something comes out to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seem more admirable. You
are laughing at me, and I own it is presumjjtuous to praise ; but
I did not mean to praise, only to admire.''

<p/>' I like very much to hear my nephew praised ; I was only
smiling at your enthusiastic way.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wonder I am not more enthusiastic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) plain good sense that drives away that sort
of feeling, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is as near heroism in the way of self-sacrifice
as a man can be in these days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Poor Philip ! if disappointment can make a hero, it has
fallen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) share. Ah ! Guy, you are brightening and look-
ing like one of my young ladies in hopes of a tale of true love
crossed, but it was only love of a sister.''

<p/>' The sister for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gave up so much ? '

<p/>' Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister Margaret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was eight or nine years older,
very handsome, very clever, a good deal like him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) -- a pattern
elder sister ; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) up in great part after his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
mother died, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I do believe it made
tlie sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) prospects quite easy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), to know it was
for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sake, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would live on at Stylehurst, and the
change be softened to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then came Fanny's illness, and
that led to the marriage with Dr. Henley. It was just what no
one could object to ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) is a respectable man in full practice,
with a large income ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) is much older than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
equal in mind or cultivation, and though I hardly like to say



<p/>44 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>so, not at all a religious man. At any rate, Margaret Morville
was one of the last people one could bear to see marry for the
sake of an establishment.''

<p/>' Could her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother do nothing 1 '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) expostulated with all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might ; but at nineteen he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could
do little with a determined sister of twenty-seven ; and the
very truth and power of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) remonstrance must have made
it leave a sting. Poor fellow, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) suffered terribly --
just as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had lost Fanny, too, which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) felt very deeply, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a very sweet creature, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). It
was like losing both sisters and home at once.''

<p/>' Has he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) not just been staying with Mrs. Henley 1 '

<p/>' Yes. There was never any coolness, as people call it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is
the one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) loves and is proud of. They always corre-
spond, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) often stays witli her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) owns to disliking
the Doctor, and I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has much comfort in Margaret
herself, for lie always comes back more grave and stern than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
went. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) house, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) good wislies, can be no home to
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ; and so we try to make Hollywell supply the place of
Stylehurst as well as we can.''

<p/>' How glad he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must be to have you to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' Philip ? Oh no. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was always reserved ; open to no one
but Margaret, not even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father ; and since her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) marriage
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has shut himself up within himself more than ever. It has,
at least I think it is tliis that has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a severity, an
unwillingness to trust, which I believe is often the consequence
of a great disappointment either in love or in f riendsliip.''

<p/>' Thank you for telling me,'' said Guy : ' I shall understand
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) better, and look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) more. Oh ! it is a cruel thing
to find that what one loves is, or has not been, all one thought.
What must he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not have gone througli ! '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was well pleased to have given so much
assistance to Guy's sincere desire to become attaclied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
cousin, one of the most favourable signs in tlie character that
was winning so much upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>A cloud was o'er my childhood's dream,

<p/>I sat in solitude ;
I know not how-- I know not why,
But round my soul all drearily

<p/>There was a silent shroud.

<p/>Thoughts in Past Years

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was anxious to hear Mr. Lascelles' opinion
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) pupil, and in time she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) learnt that lie thought Sir Guy
had very good abilities, and a fair amount of general inform-
ation ; but tliat his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) classical knowledge was far from accurate,
and mathematics had been greatly neglected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 45

<p/>encouraged to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) work done when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gathered th3
general meaning of a passage, or translated it into English
verse, si:>irited and flowing, but often further from the original
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor could perceive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never been taught
to work, at least as other boys study, and great application
would be requisite to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attainments to a level with
those of far less clever boys educated at a public school.

<p/>Mr. Lascelles told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) so at first ; but as there were no
reflections on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) grandfather, or on Mr. Potts, Guy's lip did
not sufter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only asked how many hours a day he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ought
to read. <div class="bookquote">``Three,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lascelles/Lascelles</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lascelles, with due regard to a
probable want of habits of application ; but then remembering
how much was undone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) added, that `it ought to be four,
or more, if possible.''

<p/>' Four it shall be,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' five, if I can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whole strength of will was set to accomplish these four
hours, taking them before and after breakfast, working hard all
the morning till the last hour before luncheon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came to
read the lectures on poetry with Charles. Here, for the first
time, it appeared that Charles had so entirely ceased to consider
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as company, as to domineer over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own family.

<p/>Used as Guy had been to an active out-of-doors life, and now
turned back to authors he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had read long ago, to fight his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way
through the construction of their language, not excusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self one jot of the difficulty, nor turning aside from one moun-
tain over which his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own efforts could carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found liis
work as tough and tedious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could wish or fear, and by the
end of the morning was thoroughly fagged. Then would have
been the refreshing time for recreation in that pleasant idling-
place, the Hollywell drawing-room. Any other time of day
would have suited Charles as well for the reading, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) liked
to take the hour at noon, and never perceived that this made all
the difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend of a toil or a pleasure. Now and then
Guy gave tremendous yawns ; and once when Charles told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was very stupid, proposed a different time ; but as Charles
objected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) yielded as submissively as the rest of the household
were accustomed to do.

<p/>To watch Guy was one of Charles's chief amusements, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
rejoiced greatly in the prospect of hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
first dinner-party. Mr., Mrs., and Miss Edmonstone, and ^ir
Guy Morville, were invited to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow.
Mr. Edmonstone was delighted as usual with any opportunity
of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) neighbours ; Guy looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not know
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liked the notion or not ; Laura told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) it would be
very absurd and stupid, but there would be some good music,
and Charles ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to say no more, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might have the
account, the next morning, from a fresh and unprejudiced mind.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) next morning's question was, of course, <div class="bookquote">``How did you
like your party ? '

<p/>' 0, it was great fun.''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>Guy's favourite answer was caught up



<p/>40 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>in the midst, as Laura replied, ' It was just what tlieir parties
always are.''

<p/>' Come, let us have the history. Who handed who in to dinner ?
I hope Guy had Mrs. Brownlow.''

<p/>' Oh no,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ; ' we had both the honourables.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Philip?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' the fidus Achates was without his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pious
JEneas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Very good, Guy,'' said Charles, enjoying the laugh.

<p/>' I could not help thinking of it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ratlier apologizing,
' when I was watching Thorndale's manner ; it is such an imita-
tion of Philip ; looking droller, I think, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) absence, than in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) presence. I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is conscious of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' It does not suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has no natural dignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>``A man ought to be six foot one, person and mind, to suit
with that grand, sedate, gracious way of Philip<div class="bookquote">``s,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' There's Guy's measure of Philip's intellect,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ;
`just six foot one inch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As much more than other people's as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) height,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' Who was your neighbour, Laura 1 ' asked Amy.

<p/>' Dr. Mayerne ; I was very glad of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), to keep off those hunt-
ing friends of Mr. Brownlow, who never ask anything but if
one has been to the races, and if one likes balls.''

<p/>' And how did Mrs. Brownlow behave 1 ' said Charles.

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) is a wonderful woman,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
quiet way ; and Guy, with an expression between drollery and
simplicity, said, ' Then there aren't many like her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>' I hope not,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) really a lady ? '

<p/>' Philip commonly calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">'' that woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>' said Charles. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
has never got over her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) one night classing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">'' young
man ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and myself, as three of the shyest monkeys she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ever came
across.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) won't say so of Maurice,'' said Laura, as they recovered
tlie laugh.

<p/>' I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) deluding some young lady by saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) was the
eldest son,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Mamma ! ' cried Amy, ' could she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) have thought so ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I put in a gentle hint on Lord de Courcy's existence, to
whicli she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick way, ' O ay, I forgot ; but
tlien he (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) is the second, and that's the next thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``If you could but have heard the stories she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Maurice
were telling each other ! ' said Guy. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was playing her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off, I
believe ; for whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cajDped with something more
wonderful. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really a lady 1 '

<p/>' By birth,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone. ' It is only her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) high spirits
and small judgment that make her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) so absurd.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' How loud she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is, too 1 ' said Laura. ' What was all that
about horses, Guy ? '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 47

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) drove two such spirited horses, that all
the grooms were afraid of them ; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wanted to take
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) little boy, Mr. Brownlow said, <div class="bookquote">'' You may do as you like,
my dear, but I won't have my son's neck broken, whatever you
do with your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brownlow</b></font>)</div>So Maurice answered by declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) knew
a lady who drove, not two, but four-in-hand, and when the
leaders turned round and looked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the face, gave a little
nod, and said, ' I'm obliged for your civility.''

<p/>' Oh ! I wish I had heard that,'' cried Laura.

<p/>' Did you hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) smoked cigars ? '

<p/>Every one cried out with horror or laughter.

<p/>' Of course, Maurice told a story of a lady who had a cigar-
case hanging at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chatelaine, and always took one to refresh
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) after a ball.''

<p/>Guy was interrupted by the announcement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) horse, and
rode off at once to Mr. Lascelles.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) return he (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) went straight to the drawing-room, where Mrs.
Edmonstone was reading to Charles, and abruptly exclaimed, --

<p/>' I told you wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had smoked one cigar.''
Then, perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was interrupting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I beg
your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and went away.

<p/>The next evening, on coming in from a solitary skating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
found the younger party in the drawing-room, Charles enter-
taining the Miss Harpers with the story of the cigars. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
hastily interposed --

<p/>' I told you it was but one.''

<p/>' Ay, tried one, and went on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harpers</b></font>) was preparing an order for
Havannah/

<p/>' I thought I told you I repeated the conversation incorrectly.''

<p/>' If it is not the letter, it is the spirit,'' said Charles, vexed at
the interference with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sport of amazing the Harpers with
outrageous stories of Mrs. Brownlow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just like her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said one of them. <div class="bookquote">``I could believe any-
thing of Mrs. Brownlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You must not believe this,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, gently. ' I repeated
incorrectly what had better have been forgotten, and I must
beg my foolish exaggeration may go no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles became sullenly silent ; Guy stood thoughtful ; and
Laura and Amabel could not easily sustain the conversation till
the visitors took their leave.

<p/>' Here's a pother ! ' grumbled Charles, as soon as they were gone.

<p/>' I beg your pardon for spoiling your story,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' but it
was my fault, so I was obliged to interfere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Bosh ! ' said Charles. ' Who cares wliether she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) smoked one
or twenty 1 She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is Mrs. Brownlow still.''

<p/>' The point is, what was truth 1 ' said Laura.

<p/>' Straining at gnats,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Little wings ? ' said Guy, glancing at Amabel.

<p/>' Have it your own way,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head back ;
' they mu^t be little souls, indeed, that stick at such trash.''



 (<font color='red'><b>CLYFFE Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>48 THE HEIR OF REI-RRB-CLYFFE

<p/>Guy's brows were contracted with vexation, but Laura looked
up very prettily, saying --

<p/>' Never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). We must all honour you for doing such an
unpleasant thing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) favourably to Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>growled
Charles.

<p/>There was no reply, and presently Guy asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would go up to dress 1 Having no other way of showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
displeasure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) refused, and remained nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ill-humour,
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forgot how slight the offence had been, and worked him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self into a sort of insane desire -- half mischievous, half revenge-
ful -- to be as provoking as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turn.

<p/>Seldom had he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) been more contrary^ as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) old nurse was wont
to call it. No one could please him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and Guy was not allowed to
do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said was intended to rub on
some sore place in Guy's mind. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother and Laura's signs
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) worse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had the pleasure of teasing them, also ;
but Guy endured it all with perfect temper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grew more
cross at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) failure ; yet, from force of habit, at bed-time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
found himself on the stairs with Guy's arm supporting hini.

<p/>' Good night,'' said Guy, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had landecf him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own
room.

<p/>' Good night,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' I tried hard to poke up the lion
to-night, but I see it won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This plea of trying experiments was neither absolutely true
nor false ; but it restored Charles to himself, by saving a confes-
sion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been out of temper, and enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to treat
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wonted indifference the expostulations of father, mother,
and Laura.

<p/>Now that the idea of ' poking up the lion ' had once occurred,
it became his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) great occupation to attempt it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to see
some evidence of the fiery temper, and it was a new sport to try
to rouse it ; one, too, which had the greater relish, as it kept the
rest of the family on thorns.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would argue against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) real opinion, talk against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) better
sense, take the wrong side, and say much that was very far from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) true sentiments. Guy could not understand at first, and was
quite confounded at some of the views he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) espoused, till Laura
came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) help, greatly irritating her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother by liints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was not in earnest. Next time she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could speak to Guy alone,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must not take all Charles said literally.

<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could hardly mean it : but why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) talk so ?

<p/>' I can't excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; I know it is very wrong, and at the
expense of truth, and it is very disagreeable of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-- I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
would not ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always does what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) likes, and it is one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) amusements, so we must bear with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), poor fellow.''

<p/>From that time Guy seemed to have no trouble in reining in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) temper in arguing with Charles, except once, when the lion
was fairly roused by something that sounded like a sneer about
King Charles I.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 4g

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole face changed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hazel eye gleamed with light like
an eagle's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) started up, exclaiming -- •

<p/>' You did not mean that ? '

<p/>' Ask Strafford,'' answered Charles, coolly, startled, but satisfied
to have found the vulnerable point.

<p/>' Ungenerous, unmanly,'' said Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice low, but quivering
with indignation ; ' ungenerous to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so
bitterly repented. Could not his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) penitence, could not his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own

<p/>blood •' but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke, the gleam of wrath faded, the flush

<p/>deepened on the cheek, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) left the room.

<p/>' Ha ! ' soliloquized Charles, ' I've done it ! I could fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wrath something terrific when it was once well up. I didn't
know what was coming next ; but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has got himself
pretty well in hand. It is playing with edge tools ; and now I
have been favoured with one flash of the Morville eye, I'll let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) alone ; but it ryled me to be treated as something beneath
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) anger, like a woman or a child.''

<p/>In about ten minutes Guy came back : ' I am sorry I was
hasty just now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>' I did not know you had such personal feelings about King
Charles.''

<p/>' If you would do me a kindness,<div class="bookquote">'' proceeded Guy, ' you would
just say you did not mean it. I know you do not, but if you
would only say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am glad you have the wit to see I have too much taste to
be a roundhead.''

<p/>' Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' I hope I shall know your jest from
your earnest another time. Only if you would oblige me, you
would never jest again about King Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brow darkened into a stern, grave expression, so entirely
in earnest, that Charles, though making no answer, could not
do otherwise than feel compliance unavoidable. Charles had
never been so entirely conquered, yet, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
not, as usual, rendered sullen.

<p/>At night, when Guy had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) paused,
and said -- ' You are sure you have forgiven me 1 '

<p/>' What ! you have not forgotten that yet ? ' said Charles.

<p/>' Of course not.''

<p/>' I am sorry you bear so much malice,'' said Charles, smiling.

<p/>' What are you imagining ? ' cried Guy. ' It was my own part
I was rememlDering, as I must, you know.''

<p/>Charles did not clioose to betray that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not see the
necessity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought King Charles's wrongs were rankling. I only
spoke as taking liberties with a friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,'' said Guy, thoughtfully, `it may be foolish, but I do
not feel as if one could do so with King Charles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is too
near home ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suffered too nmch from scoffs and railings ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
heart was too tender, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) repentance too deep for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friends to
add one word even in jest to the heap of reproach. How one

<p/>E



<p/>50 THE HEIR OF REBCLYFFE

<p/>would have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ! ' proceeded Guy, wrapped up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own
thoughts,--' loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for the gentleness so little accordant with
the rude times and the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had to act -- served him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) half like
a knight's devotion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lady-love, half like devotion to a saint,
as Montrose did --

<p/>' Great, good, and just, could I but rate

<p/>My grief, and thy too rigid fate,

<p/>I'd weep the world in such a strain.

<p/>As it should deluge once again.''

<p/>* And, oh ! ' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), with sudden vehemence, ' how one would
have fought for him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' You would ! ' said Charles. ' I should like to see you and
Deloraine charging at the head of Prince Rupert's troopers.''

<p/>' I beg your pardon,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, suddenly recalled, and colouring
deeply ; ' I believe I forgot where I was, and have treated you
to one of my old dreams in my boatings at home. You may
quiz me as much as you jDlease to-morrow. Good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' It was a rhapsody ! ' thought Charles ; ' yes, it was. I wonder
I don't laugh at it ; but I was actually carried along. Fancy
that ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did it so naturally ; in fact, it was all from the
bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heart, and I could not quiz him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) -- no, no more
than Montrose himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is a strange article ! but lie keeps
one awake, which is more than most people do ! '

<p/>Guy was indeed likely to keej^ everyone awake just then ; for
Mr. Edmonstone was going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) out hunting for the
first time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was half wild about it. The day came, and
half an hour before Mr. Edmonstone was ready, Guy was walk-
ing about the hall, checking many an incipient whistle, and telling
every one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was beforehand with tlie world, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had read
one extra hour yesterday, and had got through the others before
breakfast. Laura thought it very true that, as Philip said, lie
was only a boy, and moralized to Cliarlotte on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) being the
same age as herself -- very nearly eighteen. Mrs. Edmonstone
told Charles it was a treat to see any one so happy, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) began to chafe at the delay, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) best to beguile the time,
but without much success. Guy had never learned to wait
patiently, and had a custom of marching up and down, and lis-
tening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head thrown back, or, as Charles used to call it,
' prancing in the hall.''

<p/>If Mrs. Edmonstone's patience was tried by the preparation
for the hunt in the morning, it was no less her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) lot to hear of it
in the evening. Guy came home in the highest spirits, pouring
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) delight to every one, with animation and power of
description giving all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said a charm. The pleasure did not
lose by repetition ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was more engrossed by it every time ; and
no one could be more pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ardour than Mr. Edmon-
stone, who, proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) riding, gave a sigh to past
hopes of poor Charles, and promoted the hunting with far more
glee than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had promoted the reading.

<p/>The Redclyffe groom, William, whose surname of Robinson



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 61

<p/>was entirely forgotten in the appellation of William of Deloraine,
was as proud of Bir Guy as Mr. Eclmonstone could be ; but made
representations to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) master that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) must not hunt Deloraine
two days in the week, and ride him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to Broadstone two more.
Guy then walked to Broadstone ; but William was no better
pleased, for he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) thought the credit of lledclytfe compromised,
and punished him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) bv reporting Deloraine not tit to be used next
hunting-day. Mr. Edmonstone perceived that Guy ought to
have another hunter ; Philii3 heard of one for sale, and after due
inspection all admired -- even William, who had begun by re-
marking that there might be so many screw-looses about a horse,
that a man did not know what to be at with them.

<p/>Philip, who was conducting the negotiation, came to dine at
Hollywell to settle the particulars. Guy was in a most eager
state ; and they and Mr. Edmonstone talked so long about
horses, that they sent Charles to sleep ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother began to
read, and the two elder girls fell into a low, mysterious confabu-
lation of their own till they were startled by a question from
Philip as to what could engross them so deeply.

<p/>' It was,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' a banshee story in Eveleen de Courcy's
last letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I never like telling ghost stories to people who don't believe
in them,'' half whispered Amabel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sister.

<p/>' Do you believe them 1 ' asked Philip, looking full at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>).

<p/>' Now I won't have little Amy asked the sort of question she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
most dislikes,'' interposed Laura ; ' I had rather ask if you laugh
at us for thinking many ghost stories inexplicable ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' The universal belief could hardly be kept up without some
grounds,'' said Guy.

<p/>' That would apply as well to fairies,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Every one has an unexplained ghost story,'' said Amy.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' but I would give something to meet any
one whose ghost story did not rest on the testimony of a friend's
cousin's cousin, a very strong-minded person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't imagine how a person who has seen a ghost could
ever speak of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/>' Did you not tell us a story of pixies at RedclyfFe ? ' said Laura.

<p/>' O yes ; the people there believe in them firmly. Jonas
Ledbury heard them laughing one night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledbury</b></font>) could not get
the gate open,'' said Guy.

<p/>' Ah ! you are the authority for ghosts,'' said Philip.

<p/>' I forgot that,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura : ' I wonder we never asked you
about your Redclyffe ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' You look as if you had seen it yourself,'' said Philip.

<p/>' You have not ? ' exclaimed Amy, almost frightened.

<p/>' Come, let us have the whole story,'' said Philip. ' Was it
your own reflection in the glass 1 was it old Sir Hugh ? or was
it the murderer of Becket ^ Come, the ladies are both ready to

<p/>Amy could not think how Pliilip could have gone on all this
time ; perhaps it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was not watching how Guy's
colour varied, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip ; and at last his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes seemed to
grow dark in the middle, and to sparkle with lire, as with a low,
deep tone, like distant thunder, conveying a tremendous force

<p/>of suppressed passion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed, ``Beware of trifling '

<p/>then breaking off, hastened out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter f* asked Mr. Edmonstone, startled from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nap ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife looked up anxiously, but returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
book, as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nephew replied, ' Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' How could you, Philip ? ' said Laura.

<p/>' I really believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has seen it ! ' said Amy, in a startled whisper.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has felt it. Amy -- the Morville spirit,'' said Philip.

<p/>' It is a great pity you spoke of putting a cocked hat to it,<div class="bookquote">''
said Laura ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must have suspected us of telling you what
happened about Mrs. Brownlow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' And are you going to do it now ? ' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) sister, in a tone
of remonstrance.

<p/>' I think Philip should hear it ! ' said Laura ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) pro-
ceeded to relate the story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was glad to see tliat her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin
was struck with it ; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) admired this care to maintain strict
truth, and even opened a memorandum-book -- the sight of
which Charles dreaded -- and read the following extract : ' Do
not think of one falsity as harmless, and another as slight, and
another as unintended. Cast them all aside. They may be light
and accidental, but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the
pit, for all that ; and it is better that our hearts should be
swept clean of them, without over care as to which is the largest
or blackest.''

<p/>Laura and Amy were mucli pleased ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went on to regret
that such excellent dispositions sliould be coupled with such
vehemence of character and that unliappy temper. Amy was
glad that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister ventured to hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) might be more
cautious in avoiding collisions.

<p/>' I am cautious,<div class="bookquote">'' replied he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), quickly and sternly ; ' I am not to
be told of the necessity of exercising forbearance with this poor
boy ; but it is impossible to reckon on all the points on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is sensitive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is sensitive,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura. ' I don't mean only in temper,
but in everything. I wonder if it is part of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) musical tempera-
ment to be as keenly alive to all around, as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ear is to every
note. A bright day, a tine view, is such real happiness to liim ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dwells on every beauty of Redely ffe with such affection ; and
then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reads, Charles says it is like going over the story

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) makes all the characters so real in talking them over,''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it hardly safe for so excitable a mind to
dwell much on the world of fiction,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip,

<p/>' Nothing has affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so much as Sintram,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura.
' I never saw anything like it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took it up by chance, and
stood reading it while all those strange expressions began to flit
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fairly cried over it so much, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was obliged to fly out of the room. How often he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has read
it I cannot tell ; I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has bought one for himself, and it
is as if the engraving had a fascination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stands
looking at it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in a dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sintram</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is a great mystery,'' said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All men are mysterious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, `b-RRB-ut he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not more than
others, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may appear so to you, because you have not
had much experience, and also because most of the men you
have seen have been rounded into uniformity like marbles, their
sharp angles rubbed off<div class="bookquote">'' against each other at school.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>' Would it be better if there were more sharp angles ? ' said
Laura, thus setting on foot a discussion on public schools, on
which Philip had, of couj-se, a great deal to say.

<p/>Amy's kind little heart was meanwhile grieving for Guy, and
longing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) return, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not come till after Philip's
departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked pale and mournful, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hair hanging
loose and disordered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) terror was excited lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might
actually have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ancestor's ghost, which, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
desire to believe in ghosts, in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not by any means
wish to have authenticated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was surprised and a good deal
vexed to find Philip gone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said hardly anything, and it
was soon bedtime. When Charles took his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) exclaimed,
on finding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sleeve wet -- ' What can you have been doing 1 '

<p/>' Walking up and down under the wall,'' replied Guy, with
some reluctance.

<p/>' What, in the rain 1 '

<p/>' I don't know, perhaps it was.''

<p/>Amy, who was just behind, carrying the crutch, dreaded
Charles's making any allusion to Sintram's wild locks and even-
ing wanderings, but ever since the outburst about King Charles,
the desire to tease and irritate Guy had ceased.

<p/>They parted at the dressing-room door, and as Guy bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
good night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pushed back the damp hair that had fallen across
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forehead, saying, ' I am sorry I disturbed your evening. I
will tell you the meaning of it another time.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has certainly seen the ghost ! ' said silly little Amy, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shut herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own room in such a fit of vague ' eerie '
fright, that it was not till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had knelt down, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face
hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands, said her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) evening prayer, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could ven-
ture to lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head and look into the dark corners of the room.

<p/>' Another time ! ' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart throbbed at the promise.

<p/>The next afternoon, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and Laura were fighting with
a refractory branch of westeria which had been torn down by
the wind, and refused to return to its plaqe, Guy, who had been

<p/>with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, came in from the stable-yard, reduced the trail-
ing bough to olDedience, and then joined them in their walk.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked grave, was silent at first, and then spoke abruptly --
<div class="bookquote">``It is due to you to explain my behaviour last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy thinks you must have seen the ghost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura,
trying to be gay.

<p/>' Did I frighten you 1 ' said Guy, turning round, full of com-
punction. ' No, no, I never saw it. I never even heard of its
being seen. I am very sorry.''

<p/>' I was very silly,'' said Amy, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>proceeded Guy, `when I think of the origin of the
ghost story I cannot laugh, and if Philip knew all '

<p/>' Oh ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) does not,<div class="bookquote">'' cried Laura ; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only looks on it as we
have always done, as a sort of romantic appendage to RedclyfFe.
I should think better of a place for being haunted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' I used to be proud of it,'' said Guy. ' I wanted to make out
whether it was old Sir Hugh or the murderer of Becket, who
was said to groan and turn the lock of Dark Hugh's chamber.
I hunted among old papers, and a horrible story I found. That
wretched Sir Hugh, -- the same who began the quarrel with
your mother's family -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) was a courtier of Charles II., as l^ad
or worse than any oi that crew -- '

<p/>' What was the quarrel about 1 ' said Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was believed to have either falsified or destroyed his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
father's will, so as to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) brother, your ancestor, landless ;
liis brother remonstrated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) turned him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) out of doors.
The forgery never was proved, but there was little doubt of
it. There are traditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) crimes without number, espe-
cially his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) furious anger and malice. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) compelled a poor lady to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was in love with another man ; tlien he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was jealous ; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waylaid liis rival, shut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up in the turret
chamber, committed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to prison, and bribed Judge Jefieries
to sentence him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) -- nay, it is even said he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) wife to see
the execution ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was so execrated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) fled the country ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went to Holland, curried favour with William of Orange,
brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>) wealth to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>), and that is the deserving action
which got him (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>) the baronetcy ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>) served in the army a good
many years, and came home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Orange</b></font>) sins would
be forgotten. But do you remember those lines 1 ' and Guy
repeated them in the low rigid tone, almost of horror, in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)^had been telling the story : --

<p/>' On some his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) vigorous judgments light,
In that dread pause `twixt day and night.

Round some, ere yet they meet their doom,
Is shed the silence of the tomb,

<p/>The eternal shadows lower.

<p/>' It was so with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) senses, and after many
actions of mad violence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ended by hanging himself in the
very room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had imprisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) victim.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 55

<p/>' Horrible ! ' said Laura. ' Yet I do not see why, when it is
all past, you should feel it so deeply.''

<p/>' How should I not feel it ? ' answered Guy. ' Is it not written
that the sins of the fathers shall be \-isited on the children?
You wonder to see me so foolish about Sintram. Well, it is my
firm belief that such a curse of sin and death as was on Sintram
rests on the descendants of that miserable man.''

<p/>The girls were silent, struck with awe and dismay at the
fearful reality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pronounced the words. At last
Amy whispered, ' But Sintram conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doom.''

<p/>At the same time Laura gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thoughts together, and
said, ' This must be an imagination. You have dwelt on it and
fostered it till you believe it, but such notions should be driven
away or they will work their own fulfilment.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at the history of the Morvilles, and see if it be an
imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. ' Crime and l^loodshed have been the

<p/>Sortion of each -- each has added weight and darkness to the
oom which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has handed on. My own poor father, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
early death, was, perhaps, the happiest ! '

<p/>Laura saw the idea was too deeply rooted to be treated as a
fancy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) found a better argument. ' The doom of sin and
death is on us all, but you should remember that if you are a
Morville you are also a Christian.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) does remember it ! ' said Amy, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
face, and then casting them down, blushing at having under-
stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) countenance, where, in the midst of the gloomy shades,
there rested for an instant the gleam which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother had
likened to the expression of Rafiaelle's cherub.

<p/>They walked on for some time in silence. At last Laura
exclaimed, ' Are you really like the portrait of this unfortunate
Sir Hugh f'

<p/>Guy made a sign of assent.

<p/>' Oh 1 it must have been taken before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grew wicked,'' said
Amy ; and Laura felt the same conviction, that treacherous
revenge could never have existed beneath so open a counte-
nance, with so much of highmindedness, pure faith, and con-
tempt of wrong in every glance of the eagle eye, in the frank
expansion of the smooth forehead.

<p/>They were interrupted by Mr. Edmonstone's hearty voice,
bawling across the garden for one of the men. ' O Guy ! are
you there?'' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Just what I
wanted ! Your gun, man ! We are going to ferret a rabbit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy ran off at full speed in search of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gun, whistling to
Bustle. Mr. Edmonstone found his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) man, and tlie sisters were
again alone.

<p/>' Poor fellow ! ' said Laura.

<p/>' You will not tell all this to Philip ? ' said Amy.

<p/>' It would show why he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was hurt, and it can be no secret.''

<p/>' I dare say you are right, but I have a feeling against it.
Well, I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not seen the ghost ! '



<p/>56 THE HEIK OF EEDCLYFFE

<p/>The two girls had taken their walk, and were just going in,
when, looking round, they saw Philip walking fast and deter-
minedly up the approach, and as they turned back to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), the first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said was, ' Where is Guy 1 '

<p/>' Ferreting rabbits with papa. What is the matter 1 '

<p/>' And where is my aunt 1 '

<p/>' Driving out with Charles and Charlotte. What is the matter 1 '

<p/>* Look here. Can you tell me the meaning of this which I
found on my table when I came in this morning ? '

<p/>It was a card of Sir Guy Morville, on the back of which was
written in pencil, <div class="bookquote">``Dear P., I find hunting and reading don't
agree, so take no further steps about the horse. Many thanks
for your trouble. -- G. M.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy Morville/Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' There,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' is the result of brooding all night on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
resentment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh no ! ' cried Laura, colouring with eagerness, ' you do not
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not l3ear it last night, because, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been explaining to us, that old Sir Hugli's story was
more shocking than we ever guessed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has a fancy that
their misfortunes are a family fate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear to
liear it spoken of lightly.''

<p/>' Oh ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been telling you his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own story, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ? '

<p/>Laura's colour grew still deeper. <div class="bookquote">``If you had been there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said, ' you would have been convinced. Why will you not
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) finds hunting interfere with reading 1 '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should haA^e thought of that before,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' Here
have I half bought the horse ! I have wasted the whole morn-
ing on it, and now I have to leave it on the man's liands. ^ I
had a dozen times rather take it myself, if I could afford it.
Such a bargain as I had made, and such an animal as you will
not see twice in your life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is a great pity,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have known his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own mind. I don't like people to give trouble for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Crazy about it last night, and giving it up this morning I
A most extraordinary proceeding. No, no, Laura, this is not
simple fickleness, it would be too absurd. It is temper, temper,
which makes a man punish himself, in hopes of punisliing others.''

<p/>Laura still spoke for Guy, and Amy rejoiced ; for if her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sister had not taken up the defence of the absent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt too strongly to be willing to speak. It seemed too
absurd for one feeling himself under such a doom to wrangle
about a horse, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was somewhat amused by the conviction
that if Guy had really wished to annoy Philip he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had certainly
succeeded.

<p/>There was no coming to an agreement. _ Laura's sense of
justice revolted at the notion of Guy's being guilty of petty
spite ; while Philip, firm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) preconceived idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
character, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own knowledge of mankind, was persuaded
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had imputed the true motive, and was displeased at
La.ura's attempting to argue the point- He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not wait to



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 57

<p/>see any one else, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was engaged to dine out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) set
off again at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) quick, resolute pace.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is very unfair ! ' exclaimed Amy.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not mean to be so,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura; `and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is
mistaken in imputing such motives, Guy's conduct has certainly
been vexatious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>They were just turning to go in, when they were interrupted
by the return of the carriage ; and before Charles had been
helped up the steps, their father and Guy came in sight. While
Guy went to shut up Bustle, who was too wet for the drawing-
room, Mr. Edmonstone came up to the others, kicking away the
pebbles before liim, and fidgeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) gloves, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) always
did when vexed.

<p/>' Here's a pretty go ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). ' Here is Guy telling me
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) won't hunt any more ! '

<p/>' Not hunt ! ' cried Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles at once ;
' and why ? '

<p/>' Oh ! something about its taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reading ;
but that can't be it -- impossible, you know ; I'd give ten pounds
to know what has vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). So keen as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was about it last
night, and I vow, one of the best riders in the whole field.
Giving up that horse, too -- I declare it is a perfect sin ! I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had gone too far, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had left a note with
Philip this morning.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura ; <div class="bookquote">``Philip has just been here about it. Guy
left a card, saying, hunting and reading would not agree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' That is an excuse, depend upon it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone.
' Something has nettled him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), I am sure. It could not be that
Gordon, could it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) hail-fellow-well-met manner? I
thought Guy did not half like it the other day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rode

pride of their own ; eh, mamma ? '

<p/>' I should be inclined to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own account of himself,''
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>' I tell you, `tis utterly against reason,'' said Mr. Edmonstone,
angrily. ' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was a fellow like Philip, or James Ross, I could
believe it ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) make a book-worm ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hates it, like
poison, at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) heart, I'll answer for it ; and the
worst of it is, the fellow putting forward such a fair reason
one can't-- being his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) guardian, and all -- say what one thinks of
it oneself. Eh, mamma ? '

<p/>' Not exactly,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in hand, mamma ; I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will tell you

the drawing-room.

<p/>' You are sure the reading is the only reason ? ' said Amy.

<p/>was pronounced in a way that made its meaning far from
annoying even to Guy's little champion.

<p/>Guy came in the next moment, and running lightly up-stairs
after Mrs. Edmonstone, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) opening the dressing-room
door, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might come in.

to vex you, which you might not like to mention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Edmonstone, hesitating a little.

<p/>' Me ! What could I have said to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think so ? I am
angry with no one but myself. The fact is only this, the
hunting is too pleasant ; it fills up my head all day and all
night ; and I don't attend rightly to anything else. If I am
out in the morning and try to pay for it at night, it will not
do ; I can but just keep awake, and that's all ; the Greek
letters all seem to be hunting each other, the simplest things
grow difficult, and at last all I can think of, is how near the
minute hand of my watch is to the hour I have set myself. So,
for the last fortnight, every construing with Mr. Lascelles has
been worse than the last ; and as to my Latin verses, they were
beyond everything shocking, so you see there is no making the
two things agree, and the hunting must wait till I grow
steadier, if ever I do. Heigho ! It is a great bore to be so
stupid, for I thought -- But it is of no use to talk of it ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Edmonstone would be a very unreasonable guardian,
indeed, to be displeased,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) friend, smiling. ``You say
you stopped the purchase of the horse. Why so? Could
you not keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) till you are more sure of yourself 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I might?''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>joyously exclaimed Guy. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
write to Philip this minute by the post. Such a splendid
creature : it would do you good to see it -- such action -- such a,
neck -- such spirit. It would be a shame not to secure it. But
no -- no -- ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) checked himself sorrowfully. ' I have made
up my mind before that I don't deserve it. If it was here,
it would be always to be tried ; if I heard the hounds I don't
know how I should keep from riding after them ; whereas, now
I can't, for William won't let me take Deloraine. No, I can't
trust myself to keep such a horse, and not hunt. It will serve
me right to see Mr. Brownlow on it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) will never miss
such a chance ! ' and the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) sigh bore witness to the
struggle it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).

<p/>' I should not like to use any one as you use yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with affectionate anxiety,
which seemed suddenly to change the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thoughts,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed abruptly -- ' Mrs. Edmonstone, can you tell me
anything about my mother V

<p/>' I aip afraid not,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), kindly ; ' you know we had so little



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 59

<p/>intercourse with your family, that I heard little but the bare
facts.''

<p/>' I don't think/ said Guy, leaning on the chimneypiece, ' that
I ever thought much about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) till I knew you ; but lately I
have fancied a great deal about what might have been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
had but lived.''

<p/>It was not Mrs. Edmonstone's way to say half what she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) felt ;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) went on -- ' Poor thing ! I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was quite a child.''

<p/>' Only seventeen when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) died,'' said Guy.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone went to a drawer, took out two or three
bundles of old letters, and after searching in them by the fire-
light, said -- ' Ah ! here's a little about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ; it is in a letter
from my sister-in-law, Philip's mother, when they were staying
at Stylehurst.''

<p/>' Who ? My father and mother 1 ' cried Guy, eagerly.

<p/>' Did you not know they had been there three or four days V

<p/>' No -- I know less about them than anybody,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), sadly :
but as Mrs. Edmonstone waited, doubtful as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
might be about to make disclosures for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was unpre-
pared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, hastily -- <div class="bookquote">``I do know the main facts of the
story • I was told them last autumn ; ' and an expression
denoting the remembrance of great suffering came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>)
face ; then, pausing a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) said -- ' I knew Archdeacon
Morville had been very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) was always interested about your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Edmonstone ; ' and happening to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in London some
little time after his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was pleased with the

<p/>manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was behaving then, thought -- thought '

<p/>And here, recollecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) must not speak ill of old Sir Guy,
nor palliate his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) son's conduct, poor Mrs. Edmonstone got into
an inextricable confusion -- all the worse because the fierce
twisting of a penwiper in Guy's fingers denoted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
suffering a great trial of patience. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) avoided the difficulty
thus : <div class="bookquote">``It is hard to speak of such things when there is so
much to be regretted on both sides ; but the fact was, my
brother thought your father was harshly dealt with at that
time. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done very wrong ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been so
much neglected and left to himself, that it seemed hardly fair
to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) oftence on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as severely as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had had more
advantages. So it ended in their coming to spend a day or two
at Stylehurst ; and this is the letter my sister-in-law wrote at
the time :

<p/>' ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Our visitors have just left us, and on the whole I am much
better pleased than I expected. The little Mrs. Morville is a
very pretty creature, and as engaging as long flaxen curls, apple-
l^lossom complexion, blue eyes, and tlie sweetest of voices can
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ; so full of childish glee and playfulness, that no one
would stop to think whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was lady-like any more than
you would with a child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) used to go singing like a bird
about the house as soon as the first strangeness wore off, which



<p/>60 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>was after her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) first game of play with Fanny and Little Philip.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) made them very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), as indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would make every
one who spent a day or two in the same house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). I could
almost defy Sir Guy not to be reconciled after one sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
sweet sunny face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is all affection and gentleness, and with
tolerable training anything might be made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is so
young in mind and manners, that one cannot even think of
blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) elopement, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had no mother, no edu-
cation but in music ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother seems to have forced it on,
thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) in Mr. Morville's way, and worked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) excitable
temperament, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) hurried them into the marriage. Poor
little girl, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little guesses what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has done ; but it
was pleasant to see how devotedly attached he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ;
and there was something beautiful in the softening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) im-
petuous tones when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) said, ' Marianne ; ' and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pride in him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
was very pretty, like a child playing at matronly airs.'' '

<p/>Guy gave a long, heavy sigh, brushed away a tear, and after
a long silence, said, ' Is that all ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All that I like to read to you. Indeed, there is no more
about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) ; and it would be of no use to read all the reports that

into another letter, `she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) speaks of your father as a very fine
young man, with most generous impulses,<div class="bookquote">'' -- but here again she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)

worse -- so much worse, tliat my brother did not feel himself
justified in having any more to do with them.''

<p/>' Ah ! he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to America,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' I don't know any more
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came to the funeral, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
arms folded, not choosing to shake hands with my poor grand-
father.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After anotlier silence he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you read that
again ? ' and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had heard it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat shading his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brow with
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, as if to bring the fair, girlish picture fully before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
mind, while Mrs. Edmonstone sought in vain among her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) letters
for one which did not speak of the fiery passions excited on
either side, in terms too strong to be fit for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ears.

<p/>When next he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke, it was to repeat that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not been
informed of the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parents till within the last few
months. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, of course, known the manner of their death, but
had only lately become aware of the circumstances attending it.

<p/>The truth was, that Guy had grown up peculiarly shielded from
evil, but ignorant of the cause of the almost morbid solicitude with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was regarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was a very
happy, joyous boy, leading an active, enterprising life, though
so lonely as to occasion greater dreaminess and thoughtfulness
than usual at such an early age. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was devotedly attached to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather, looking on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as the first and best of human
beings, and silencing the belief that Sir Hugh Morville had



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 61

<p/>entailed a doom of crime and sorrow on the family, by a refer-
ence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>), as one who had been always good and prosperous.

<p/>When, however, Guy had reached an age at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must
encounter the influences which had proved so baneful to others
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather thought it time to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the
warning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own history.

<p/>The sins, which the repentance of years had made more odious
in the eyes of the old man, were narrated ; the idleness and
insubordination at first, then the reckless pursuit of pleasure,
the craving for excitement, the defiance of rule and authority,
till folly had become vice, and vice had led to crime.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fought no fewer than three duels, and only one had been
bloodless. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misery after the first had well-nigh led to a reform ;
but time had dulled its acuteness -- it had been lost in fresh scenes
of excitement -- and at the next ofience rage had swept away such
recollections. Indeed, so far had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost the natural generosity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remorse had been comparatively slight
for the last, which was the worst of all, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forced
the quarrel on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victim. Captain Wellwood, whose death had
left a wife and children almost destitute. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first awakening
to a sense of what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) course had been, was when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beheld
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only child, in the prime of youth, carried lifeless across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
threshold, and attributed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own intemperance and
violence. That hour made Sir Guy Morville an old and a broken-
hearted man ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) repented as vigorously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had sinned.

<p/>From the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) dared to hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) son's orphan
would be spared, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), but still mourn-
fully, envying and yet pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) innocence as something that
could not last.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) saw bright blossoms put forth, as the boy grew older ; but
they were not yet fruits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not dare to believe they ever
would be. The strength of will which had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own case, been
the slave of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passions, had been turned inward to subdue the
passions themselves, but this was only the beginning -- the trial
was not yet come. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could hope his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandson might repent, but
this was the best that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dared to think possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not
believe that a Morville could pass unscathed through the world, or
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sins would not be visited on the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) only descend-
ant ; and the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) narration was throughout such as might
almost have made the foreboding cause its own accomplishment.

<p/>The efiect was beyond what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had expected ; for a soul deeply
dyed in guilt, even though loathing its own stains, had not the
power of conceiving how foul was the aspect of vice, to one
hitherto guarded from its contemplation, and living in a world
of pure, lofty day-dreams. The boy sat the whole time with-
out a word, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face bent down and hidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clasped
hands, only now and then unable to repress a start or shudder
at some fresh disclosure ; and when it was ended, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood up,
gazed round, and walked uncertainly, as if lie did not know
where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) next impulse was to throw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)



<p/>62 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>knee beside his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grandfather, and caress him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used when a
child. The ' good-night ' was spoken, and Guy was shut into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) room, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) overwhelming emotions.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather a blood-stained, remorseful man ! The doom
complete, himself heir to the curse of Sir Hugh, and fated to run
the same career ; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) knew full well, with the tendency to
the family character strong within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>), the germs of these hateful
passions ready to take root downwards and bear fruit uj-RRB- wards,
with the very countenance of Sir Hugh, and the same darkening,
kindling eyes, of which tradition had preserved the remembrance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) was crushed for awhile. The consciousness of strength
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) own, of the still small voice that could subdue the lire,
the earthquake, and the whirlwind, was slow in coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) ;
and when it came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>), like his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) grandfather, had hope rather of
final repentance than of keeping himself unstained.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) mind had not recovered the shock when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) grandfather
died, -- died in faith and fear, with good hope of accepted repent-
ance, but unable to convey the assurance of such hope to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>)
grandson. Grief for the only parent he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) had ever known, and the
sensation of being completely alone in the world, were joined to
a vague impression of horror at the suddenness of the stroke, and
it was long before the influence of HoUywell, or the elasticity of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) own youthfulness, could rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) depression.

<p/>Even then it was almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) will that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) returned to
enjoyment, unable to avoid being amused, but feeling as if joy
was not meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>), and as if those around were walking ' in
a world of light,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could scarcely hope to tread a few
uncertain steps. In this despondency was Guy's chief danger, as
it was likely to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deem a struggle with temptation fruit-
less, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) high spirits and powers of keen enjoyment increased
the peril of recklessness in the reaction.

<p/>It was Mrs. Edmonstone who first spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cheerfully of
a successful conflict with evil, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
temptations Vf ere but such as are common to man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a clue to discover when and how to trust himself to enjoy ;
the story of Sintram had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deeply, and this very day,
Amy's words, seemingly unheeded and unheard, had brought home
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the hope and encouragement of that marvellous tale.

<p/>They had helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in standing, looking steadfastly upwards,
and treading down not merely evil, but the first token of coming
evil, regardless of the bruises he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might inflict on himself. Well
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was constant.

<p/>Such was Guy's inner life ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) outward life, frank and joyous,
has been shown, and the two flowed on like a stream, pure as
crystal, but into which the eye cannot penetrate from its depth.
The surface would be sometimes obscured by cloud or shade, and
reveal the sombre wells beneath ; but more often the sunshine
would penetrate the inmost recesses, and make them glance and
sparkle, showing themselvej* as clear and limpid as the surface
itself.

<p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Can piety the discord heal,

<p/>Or stanch the death-feud's enmity? -- Scott

<p/>It must not be supposed that such a history of Guy's mind was
expressed by himself, or understood by Mrs. Edmonstone ; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw enough to guess at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) character, perceive the sort of
guidance he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) needed, and be doubly interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Much
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could have such a friend as her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) brother would
have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew.

<p/>The present question about the horse was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought, unfor-
tunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was
no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr, Edmonstone's vexation was
soon over. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) that there had
been no offence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) strove to say with a good grace, that it was
very proper, and told Guy he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would be a thorough book-worm
and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke.

<p/>Philip had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind to be forbearing, and to say no
more about it, Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus
never come to an understanding ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hinted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wore
such a dignified air of not being offended, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was much
ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to
judge. On his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) side, Guy had no idea of the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had caused ;
so, after bestowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip
thought the worst feature of the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) best to bring
Hecuba back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind, drive the hunters out of it, and appease
the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.

<p/>When all William's manoeuvres resulted in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master's not
hunting at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was persuaded it was Mr. Edmonstone's fault,
compassionated Sir Guy with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heart, and could only solace
himself by taking Deloraine to exercise where he (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>) was most likely
to meet the hounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>) further chose to demonstrate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>)
was not Mr. Edmonstone's servant, by disregarding some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
stable regulations ; but as soon as this came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) master's know-
ledge, a few words were spoken so sharp and stern, that William
never attempted to disobey again.

<p/>It seemed as if it was the perception that so much was kept
back by a strong force, that made Guy's least token of displeasure
so formidable, A village boy, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) caught misusing a poor
dog, was found a few minutes after, by Mr. Ross, in a state of
terror that was positively ludicrous, though it did not appear
that Sir Guv had said or done much to alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) • it was only
the light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) eyes, and the strength of repressed, indignation
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) short broken words that had made the impression.

<p/>It appeared as if the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) anger might be fearful, if
once it broke forth without control ; yet at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had
a gentleness and attention, alike to small and great, which, with



<p/>64 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) high spirit and good nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) very sweet voice and pleasant
smile, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) a peculiarly winning and engaging person ; and
few who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) could help being interested in liim.

<p/>No wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had become in the eyes of the Edmonstones
almost a part of their family. Mrs. Edmonstone had assumed a
motherly control over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>), to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) submitted with a sort of
afiectionate gratitude.

<p/>One day Philip remarked, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) never saw any one so rest-
less as Guy, who could neither talk nor listen without playing
with something. Scissors, pencil, paper-knife, or anything that
came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way, was sure to be twisted or tormented ; or if no-
thing else was at hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opened and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own knife so as
to put all the spectators in fear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fingers.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' I saw how it tortured your eyebrows all
the time you were translating Schiller to us. I wondered you

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I consider that to be put out -- by which you mean to have
the intellect at the mercy of another's folly -- is beneath a

sarily ill-regulated. I should think it rather a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
no one to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of the tricks which mothers generally nip in
the bud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I was going to say that I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fidgets less,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ;
' but I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cliief contortions of the scissors liave been when
Philip has been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' They have, I believe,<div class="bookquote">'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother. ' I was thinking of
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a hint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, aunt, you are a tamer of savage beasts if you venture
on such a subject,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Do you dare me ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) asked, smiling.

<p/>' Why, I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would do more than give you one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lightning glances ; but that, I think, is more than you desire.''

<p/>' Considerably,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sake as much
as my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' mamma has nearly cured him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of pawing
like a horse in the hall when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is kept waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
knew it was impatience, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) how to cure
it. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as an old fairy might, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
in a grave, mysterious way, always to go and play the ''  (<font color='red'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>)</div>Harmo-
nious Blacksmith,<div class="bookquote">'' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) found himself getting into a taking^
just as if it was a charm. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) always does it most dutifully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>)</div><p/>' It has a very good effect,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' for it is
apt to act as a summons to the other party, as well as a sedative
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I must say I am curious to see what you will devise this time,<div class="bookquote">''
said Philip ; ' since you can't set him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to play on the piano ; and
very few can bear to be told of a trick of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In the course of that evening, Philip caused the great atlas to



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 66

<p/>be brought out, in order to make investigations on the local habi-
tation of a certain Khan of Kipchack, who existed somewhere in
the dark ages. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Khan</b></font>) came to Marco Polo, and Sir John
Mandeville ; and Guy, who knew both the books in the library
at RedclyfFe, grew very eager in talking them over, and tracing
their adventures^ -- then to the Genoese merchants, where Guy
confessed himself perfectly ignorant. Andrea Doria was the only
Genoese he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ever heard of ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hunted out with great interest
all the localities of their numerous settlements. Then came mo-
dern Italy, and its fallen palaces ; then the contrast between the
republican merchant and aristocratic lord of the soil ; then the
corn laws ; and then, and not till then, did Philip glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
aunt, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) Guy balancing a Venetian weight on as few of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fingers as could support it.

<p/>' Guy,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), smiling, ' does that unfortunate glass inspire
you with any arguments in favour of the Venetians ? '

<p/>Guy put it down at once, and Philip proceeded to improved
methods of farming, to enable landlords to meet the exigencies of
the times. Guy had got hold of Mr. Edmonstone's spectacle-
case, and was putting its spring to a hard trial. Mrs. Edmon-
stone doubted whether to interfere again ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) knew this was not
the sort of thing that tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) temper, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) particularly dis-
liked playing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) off, as it were for Philip's amusement, and quite
as much letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) go on, and lower himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) nephew's
estimation. The spectacle-case settled the matter -- a crack was
heard, it refused to snap at all ; and Guy, much discomfited,
made many apologies.

<p/>Amy laughed ; Philip was much too well-bred to do anything
but curl his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lip unconsciously. Mrs. Edm on stone waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was gone, then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was wishing Guy `good-night' at
Charles's door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, --

<p/>' The spectacle-case forestalled me in giving you a lecture on
sparing our nerves. Don't look so very full of compunction -- it
is only a trick which your mother would have stopped at five
years old, and which you can soon stop for yourself.''

<p/>' Thank you, I will,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' I hardly knew I did it, but I
am very sorry it has teased you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Thenceforward it was curious to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) put down and
pushed away all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had once begun to touch and torture. Mrs.
Edmonstone said it was self-command in no common degree ;
and Philip allowed that to cure so inveterate a habit required
considerable strength of will.

<p/>' However,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, ' I always gave the Mor\`illes credit for an
iron resolution. Yes, Amy, you may laugh ; but if a man is not
resolute in a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will never be resolute in great matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' And Guy has been resolute the right way this time,'' said
Laura.

<p/>' May he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) always be the same,'' said Philip.

<p/>Philip had undertaken, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) way back to Broadstone, to
conduct Charlotte to East-hill, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to spend the day

<p/>F



<p/>66 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>with a little niece of Mary Ross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) presently came down, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
bonnet-strings tied in a most resolute-looking bow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
little figure drawn up so as to look as womanly as possible for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) first walk alone with Philip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) wished the party at home
' good-by ; ' and as Amy and Laura stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), they
could not help laughing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tripping feet striving to keep
step, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) blue veil discreetly composed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little head
turned up, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was trying hard to be on equal terms with
the tall cousin, who meanwhile looked graciously down from
his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) height, patronizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) like a very small child. After some
space, Amy began to wonder what they could talk about, or
whether they would talk at all ; but Laura said there was no
fear of Charlotte's tongue ever being still, and Charles rejoined, --

<p/>' Don't you know that Philip considers it due to himself that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) audience should never be \vithout conversation suited to
their capacity 1 '

<p/>' Nonsense, Charlie ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) credit for doing it as well as it is in the
nature of things for it to be done. The strongest proof I know
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) being a superior man, is the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) adapts himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>)
company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) lays down the law to us, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) knows we
are all born to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) admirers ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) calls Thorndale his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) dear
fellow, and conducts him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) like a Mentor ; but you may observe
how different he (<font color='blue'><b>Mentor</b></font>) is with other people -- Mr. Ross, for instance.
It is not showing oif ; it is just what the pattern hero sliould be
with the pattern clergyman. At a dinner-party he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is quite in
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) place ; contents himself with leaving an impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
neighbour that Mr. Morville is at home on every subject ; and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is the right thing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother officers is sufficiently
proved, since not even Maurice either hates or quizzes him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, Charlie,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, well pleased, ' I am glad you are
convinced at last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you think I ever wanted to be convinced that we were
created for no other end than to applaud Philip? I was ful-
filling the object of our existence by enlarging on a remark of
Guy's, that nothing struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) more than the way in which
Philip could adapt his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) conversation to the hearers. So the hint
was not lost on me ; and I came to the conclusion that it was a far
greater proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sense than all the maxims he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) la\dshes on us.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder Guy was the person to make the remark,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Laura; `for it is strange that those two never appear to the
best advantage together.''

<p/>' Oh, Laura, that would be the very reason,'' said Amy.

<p/>' The very reason ? ' said Charles. ' Draw out your meaning,
Miss.''

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, colouring. ' If Guy -- if a generous person,
I mean -- were vexed with anotlier sometimes, it would be the
very reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would make the most of all liis goodness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Heigh-ho ! ' yawned Charles. ' What o'clock is it ? I wonder
when Guy is ever coming back from that Lascelles.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 67

<p/>' Your wonder need not last long,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' for I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
riding into the stable-yard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had entered ; and, on being asked if ho
had met Philip and Charlotte, and how they were getting on,
lie replied, -- ' A good deal like the print of Dignity and Impu-
dence,'' at the same time throwing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shoulders, and
composing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) countenance to imitate Philip's lofty deportment
and sedate expression, and the next moment putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head
on one side witli a sharp little nod, and giving a certain
espiegle glance of the eye, and knowing twist of one corner of
the mouth, just like Charlotte.

<p/>' By the by,'' added he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), ' would Philip have been a clergyman
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had gone to Oxford ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know; I don't think it was settled,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura.
<div class="bookquote">``Whyr

<p/>' I could never fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not have been what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gone to
Oxford,'' said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would have lived with men of the
same powers and pursuits with himself, and have found his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) level.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' And that would have been a very high one,'' said Guy.

<p/>' It would ; but there would be all the difference there is
between a feudal prince and an Eastern despot. He (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) would know
what it is to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) match.''

<p/>' But you don't attempt to call him (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) conceited ! ' cried Guy,
with a sort of consternation.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is far above that ; far too grand,'' said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should as soon think of calling Jupiter conceited,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Charles ; and Laura did not know how far to be gratified,
or otherwise.

<p/>Charles had not over-estimated Philip's readiness of self-
adaptation. Charlotte had been very happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), talking
over the Lady of the Lake, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had just read, and being
enlightened, partly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) satisfaction, partly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) disappoint-
ment, as to how much was historical. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) listened good-naturedly
to a fit of rapture, and threw in a few, not too many, discreet
words of guidance to the true principles of taste ; and next told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) about an island, in a pond at Stylehurst, which had been by
turns Ellen's isle and Robinson Crusoe's. It was at this point
in the conversation that Guy came in sight, riding slowly, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
reins on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) horse's neck, whistling a slow, melancholy tune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
eyes fixed on the sky, and so lost in musings, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not
perceive them till Philip arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) by calling out, ' That is a
very bad plan. No horse is to be trusted in that way, especially
such a spirited one.''

<p/>Guy started, and gathered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) reins, owning it was foolish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look only half disenchanted yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip. ``Has
Lascelles put you into what my father's old gardener used to
call a stud ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing so worthy of a stud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, smiling and colouring
a little. ' I was only dreaming over, a picture of ruin --

<p/>' The steed is vanish' d from the stall,
No serf is seen in Hassan's hall,
The lonely spider's thin grey pall
Waves, slowly widening o'er tlie wall.''

<p/>' Byron ! ' exclaimed Philip. ' I hope you are not dwelling on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) r

<p/>' Only a volume I found in my room.''

<p/>' Oh, the Giaour ! ' said Philip. ' Well, there is no great
damage done ; but it is bad food for excitable minds. Don't
let it get hold of you.''

<p/>' Very well ; ' and there was a cloud, but it cleared in a moment,
and, with a few gay words to both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rode oif at a quick jDace.

<p/>' Foolish fellow ! ' muttered Philip, looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>After some space of silence, Charlotte began in a very grave
tone --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Welir

<p/>' Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another ' Well 1 ' and another long pause.

<p/>' Philip, I don't know whether you'll be angry with me.''

<p/>' Certainly not,'' said Philip, marvelling what was coming.

<p/>' Guy says he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does not want to keep up the feud, and I wish
you would not.''

<p/>' What do you mean ? '

<p/>' The deadly feud ! ' said Charlotte.

<p/>' What nonsense is this 1 ' said Philip.

<p/>' Surely -- Oh Philip, there always was a deadly feud between
our ancestors and the RedclyfFe Morvilles, and it was very
wrong, and ought not to be kept up now.''

<p/>' It is not I that keep it up,''

<p/>' Is it not ? ' said Charlotte, ' But I am sure you don't like Guy,
And I can't think why not, unless it is the deadly feud, for we are
all so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Laura says it is a different house since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came.''

<p/>' Hum ! ' said Philip. ' Charlotte, you did well to make me
jDromise not to be angry with you, by which, I presume, you
mean displeased. I should like to know what put this notion
into your head.''

<p/>' Charlie told me,'' almost whispered Charlotte, hanging down
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head. ' And -- and -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what? I can't hear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte was a good deal frightened ; but either from firm-
ness, or from the female propensity to have the last word, or it
might be the spirit of mischief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) got out -- ' You have made
me quite sure of it yourself.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was so alarmed at having said this, that had it not been
undignified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have run quite away, and never stopped
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) came to East-hill, Matters were not mended when Philip
said authoritatively, and as if lie was not in the least annoyed
-LRB-which was the more vexatious-RRB-, ' What do you mean, Charlotte ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had a great mind to cry, by way of getting out of the
scrape ; but having begun as counsellor and peace-maker, it



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 69

<p/>would never do to be babyish ; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) repeating the ques-
tion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, in a tone which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not prevent froni being
lachrymose, ' You make Guy almost angry ; you tease him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and
when people praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), you answer as if it would not last ! And
it is very unfair of you,'' concluded she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with almost a sob.

<p/>' Charlotte,<div class="bookquote">'' replied Philip, much more kindly than she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) deserved, after the reproach that seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so dreadfully
naughty, ' you may dismiss all fear of deadly feud, whatever you
may mean by it. Charles has been playing tricks on you. You
know, my little cousin, that I am a Christian, and we live in
the nineteenth century.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte felt as if annihilated at the aspect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own folly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) resumed -- <div class="bookquote">``You misunderstood me. I do think Guy very
agreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is very attentive to Charles, very kind to you,
and so attractive, that I don't wonder you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). But those
who are older than you see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has faults, and we wish to
set him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) guard against them. It may be painful to our-
selves, and irritating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but depend upon it, it is the proof
of friendship. Are you satisfied, my little cousin ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could only say humbly, ' I beg your pardon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' You need not ask pardon. Since you had the notion, it v/as
right to speak, as it was to me, one of your own family. When
you are older, you need never fear to speak out in the right place.
I am glad you have so much of the right sort of feminine courage,
though in this case you might have ventured to trust to me.''

<p/>So ended Charlotte's anxieties respecting the deadly feud, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had now to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind to the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) playfellow, who
was to go to Oxford at Easter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) would be just eighteen,
his (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) birthday being tlie 28th of March. Both her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) playmates were
going. Bustle as well as Guy, and it was at first proposed that
Deloraine should go too, but Guy bethought himself that Oxford
would be a place of temptation for William ; and not choosing to
trust the horse to any one else, resolved to leave both at Hollywell.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) grandfather had left an allowance for Guy, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
coming of age, such as might leave no room for extravagance,
and which even Philip pronounced to be hardly sufficient for a
young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) position. ' You know,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hesitating, good-natured way, ' if ever you have occasion
sometimes for a little-- a little more- -you need only apply to
me. Don't be afraid, anything rather than run into debt.
You know me, and `tis your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This shall do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, in the same tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had fixed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hours of study.

<p/>Each of the family made Guy a birthday present, as an outfit
for Oxford ; Mr. Edmonstone gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) a set of studs, Mrs.
Edmonstone a Christian Year, Amabel copied some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
favourite songs, Laura made a drawing of Sintram, Charlotte
worked a kettle-holder, with what was called by courtesy a
likeness of Bustle. Charles gave nothing, professing tliat ho
would do nothing to encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yoa don't know what a bore it is to lose the one bit of

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>* You, Charles, the maker of fun ! ' said Guy, amazed.

<p/>' It is a case of flint and steel,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' but be it owing
to who it will, we have been alive since you came here. You have
taken care to be remembered. We have been studying you, or
laughing at you, or wondering what absurdity was to come next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry -- that is, if you are serious. I hoped at

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I'll tell you what you appear like. Just what I would be

<p/>' Never say that, Charlie.''

<p/>' Nay, wait a bit. I would never be so foolish. I would never
give my sunny mornings to Euripides ; I would not let the best
hunter in the county go when I had wherewithal to pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>).''

<p/>' You would not have such an ill-conditioned self to keep in rule.''

<p/>' After all,'' continued Charles, yawning, ' it is no great compli-
ment to say I am sorry you are going. If you Avere an Ethiopian
serenader, you would be a loss to me. It is something to see
anything beyond this old drawing-room, and the same faces doing
the same things every day. Laura poking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) drawing, and
meditating upon the last entry in Philip's memorandum-book,
and Amy at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) flowers or some nonsense or other, and Charlotte
and the elders all the same, and a lot of stupid people dropping
in, and a lot of stupid books to read, all just alike. I can tell
what they are like without looking in ! ' Charles yawned again,
sighed, and moved wearily. <div class="bookquote">``Now, there came some life and
freshness with you. You talk of Redclyffe, and your brute crea-
tion there, not like a book, and still less like a commonplace
man ; you are innocent and unsophisticated, and take new points
of view ; you are something to interest oneself about ; your com-
ing in is something to look forward to ; you make the singing
not such mere milk-and-water ; your reading the Prselectiones is
an additional landmark to time ; besides the mutton of to-day
succeeding the beef of yesterday. Heigh-ho ! I'll tell you what,
Guy. Though I' may carry it off with a high hand, `tis no joke
to be a helpless log all the best years of a man's life,-- nay, for
my whole life, -- for at the very best of the contingencies the doc-
tors are always flattering me with, I should make but a wretched
crippling aftair of it. And if that is the best hope they give me,
you may guess it is likely to be a pretty deal worse. Hope ?
I've been lioping these ten years, and much good has it done me.
I say, Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) proceeded, in a tone of extreme bitterness, though
with a sort of smile, ' the only wonder is that I don't hate the

I like nothing better than to hear of your ridings, and shootings,
and boatings. It is a sort of life.''

<p/>Charles had never till now alluded seriously to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) infirmity
before Guy, and the changing countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) auditor showed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to be much affected, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) stood leaning over the end of the
sofa, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) speaking eyes earnestly fixed on Charles, who
went on :

<p/>' And now you are going to Oxford. You will take your place
among the men of your day. You will hear and be heard of.
You will be somebody. And I ! -- -I know I have what they call
talent -- I could be something. They think me an idle dog ; but
where's the good of doing anything ? I only know if I was not --
not condemned to -- to this -- this life,<div class="bookquote">'' -LRB-had it not been for a sort
of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the softened
hazel eyes regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) so kindly, he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) would have used the
violent expletive that trembled on his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) lip;-RRB- `if I was not chained
down here. Master Philip should not stand alone as the paragon
of the family. I've as much mother wit as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' That you have,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' How fast you see the sense of
a passage. You could excel very much if you only tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Tried ? And what am I to gain by it ? '

<p/>' I don't know that one ought to let talents rust,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy,
thoughtfully ; ' I suppose it is one's duty not ; and surely it is
a pity to give up those readings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not get such another fellow dunce as you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Charles, ' as I told you when we began, and it would be a mere
farce to do it alone. I could not make myself, if I would.''

<p/>' Can't you make yourself do what you please ? ' said Guy, as
if it was the simplest thing in the world.

<p/>' Not a bit, if the other half of me does not like it. I forget
it, or put it ofi*, and it comes to nothing. I do declare, though,
I would get something to break my mind on-, merely as a medical
precaution, just to freshen myself up, if I could find any one to do
it with. No, nothing in the shape of a tutor, against that I protest.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sisters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>suggested Guy.

<p/>' Hum ! Laura is too intellectual already, and I don't mean to
poach on Philip's manor ; and if I made little Amy cease to be
silly, I should do away with all the comfort I have left me in
life. I don't know, though, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) swallowed learning after Mary
Ross's pattern, that it need do her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) much harm.''

<p/>Amy came into the room at the moment.

<p/>' Amy, here is Guy advising me to take you to read something
awfully wise every day ; something that will make you as dry
as a stick, and as blue '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As a gentianella,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' I should not mind being like a gentianella,'' said Amy. ' But
what dreadful thing were.you setting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to do ? '

<p/>' To make you read all the folios in my uncle's old library,<div class="bookquote">''
said Charles. ' All that. Margaret has in keeping against Philip
has a house of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own.''



 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>72 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sancho somebody, and all you talked of when first you
came?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were talking of the hour's reading that Charlie and I
have had together lately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' I was thinking how Charlie would miss that hour,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ;
`and we shall be very sorry not to have you to listen to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, then. Amy, suppose you read with me ? '

<p/>' Oh, Charlie, thank you ! Should you really like it ? ' cried
Amy, colouring with delight. ' I have always thought it would
be so very delightful if you would read with me, as James Ross
used with Mary, only I was afraid of tiring you with my
stupidity. Oh, thank you ! '

<p/>So it was settled, and Charles declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) put himself
on honour to give a good account of their doings to Guy, that
being the only way of making himself steady to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) resolution ;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was perfectly determined not to let Philip know anything
about the practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had adopted, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would by no means
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to guess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was following his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) advice.

<p/>Charles had certainly grown very fond of Guy, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
propensity to admire Philip, satisfying himself by maintaining
that, after all, Guy only tried to esteem his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin because he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thought it a point of duty, just as children think it right to
admire the good boy in a story book ; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was secretly
fretted and chafed by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) perfection. No one could deny that
there were often occasions when little misunderstandings would
arise, and that, but for Philip's coolness and Guy's readiness to
apologize, they might often have gone further ; but at the same
time no one could regret these things more than Guy liimself,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was willing and desirous to seek Philip's advice and
assistance when needed. In especial, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) listened earnestly to the
counsel which was bestowed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) about Oxford : and Mrs.
Edmonstone was convinced that no one could have more anxiety
to do right and avoid temptation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had many talks with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) dressing-room, promising to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), as did also
Charles ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) left Holly well with universal regrets, most
loudly expressed by Charlotte, who would not be comforted
without a lock of Bustle's hair, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have worn round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) neck if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not been afraid that Laura would tell Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) goes with excellent intentions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, as they
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) from the door.

<p/>' I do hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will do well,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may,'' said Philip ; ' the agreeableness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) whole
character makes one more anxious. It is very dangerous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
name, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wealth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sociable, gay disposition, that very attrac-
tive manner, all are so many perils, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has not that natural
pleasure in study that would be of itself a preservative from
temptation. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is honestly anxious to do right, and
has excellent principles. I only fear his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) temper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) want
of steadiness. Poor boy, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may do well ! '

<p/>CHAPTER VII



<p/>•Pray, good shepherd, what

<p/>Fair swain is this tliat dances with your daugliter ?
******
He (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money ; he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>)
utters them as he (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) had eaten ballads, and all men's ears
grow to his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) tunes. -- Winter's Tale

<p/>It was a glorious day in June, the sky of pure deep dazzling
blue, the sunshine glowing with brightness, but with cheerful
freshness in the air that took away all sultriness, the sun tending
westward in his (<font color='blue'><b>swain</b></font>) long day's career, and casting welcome shadows
from the tall lirs and horse-chestnuts that shaded the lawn. A
long rank of haymakers -- men and women -- proceeded with their
rakes, the white shirt-sleeves, straw bonnets, and ruddy faces,
radiant in the bath of sunshine, while in the shady end of the
field were idler haymakers among the fragrant piles, Charles half
lying on the grass, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back against a tall haycock ; Mrs.
Edmonstone sitting on another, book in hand ; Laura sketching
the busy scene, the sun glancing through the chequered shade
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) glossy curls ; Philip stretched out at full length, hat and
neck-tie off, luxuriating in the cool repose after a dusty walk
from Broadstone ; and a little way off, Amabel and Charlotte
pretending to make hay, but really building nests with it,
throwing it at each other, and j-RRB-laying as heartily as the heat
would allow.

<p/>They talked and laughed, the rest were too hot, too busy, or
too sleepy for conversation, even Philip being tired into enjoying
the dolce far niente ; and they basked in the fresh breezy heat
and perfumy hay with only now and then a word, till a cold,
black, damp nose was suddenly thrust into Charles's face, a red
tongue began licking him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; and at the same moment Charlotte,
screaming ' There he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is ! ' raced headlong across the swarths of
hay to meet Guy, who had just ridden into the held. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) threw
Deloraine's rein to one of the haymakers, and came bounding to
meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), just in time to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) foot into a
hidden hole, and fell prostrate.

<p/>In another moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was in the midst of the wdiole party,
who crowded round and welcomed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been a boy
returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first half-year's schooling ; and never did little
school-boy look more holiday-like than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), with all the sunshine
of that June day reflected, as it were, in liis glittering eyes and
glowing face, while Bustle escaping from Charles's caressing
arm, danced round, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) tail in ecstasy, and claiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
share of the welcome. Then Guy was on the ground by Charles,
rejoicing to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out there, and then, some dropping into
their former nests on the hay, some standing round, they talked
fast and eagerly in a confusion of sound that did not subside
for the first ten minutes so as to allow anything to be clearly

<p/>heard. The first distinct sentence was Charlotte's ``Bustle,
darling old fellow, you are handsomer than ever ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a delicious day ! ' next exclaimed Guy, following
Pliilip's example, by throwing off hat and neck- tie.

<p/>' A spontaneous tribute to the beauty of the day,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Charles.

<p/>' Really it is so ultra-splendid as to deserve notice ! ' said
Philip, throwing himself completely back, and looking up.

<p/>' One cannot help revelling in that deep blue ! ' said Laura.

<p/>' To-morrow'll be the happiest time of all the glad new year,''
hummed Guy.

<p/>' Ah ! you will teach us all now,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' after your grand
singing lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you know what is in store for you, Guy ? ' said Amy.
' Oh ! haven't you heard about Lady Kilcoran's ball ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are to go, Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I am not.
I hate dancing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' And I know as much about it as Bustle,'' said Guy, catching
the dog by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forepaws, and causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to perform an uncouth
dance.

<p/>' Never mind, they will soon teach you,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Must I really go ?''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) begins to think it serious,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Is Philip going 1 ' exclaimed Guy, looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was taken
by surprise.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is going to say something about dancing being a healthful
recreation for young people,'' said Charles.

<p/>' You'll be disappointed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' It is much too hot to
moralize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Apollo</b></font>)</div><p/>' Apollo unbends his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) bow,<div class="bookquote">'' exclaimed Charles. ' The captain
yields the field.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Apollo</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! Captain Morville, I ought to have congratulated you,<div class="bookquote">''
said Guy. ' I must come to Broadstone early enough to see you
on parade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Come to Broadstone ! You aren't still bound to Mr. Las-
celles,'' said Charles.

<p/>' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has time for me,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' I am too far behind the
rest of the world to afford to be idle this vacation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' That's .right, Guy,'' exclaimed Philip, sitting up, and looking
full of approval. ' With so much perseverance, you must get on
at last. How did you do in collections 1 '

<p/>' Tolerably, thank you.''

<p/>' You must be able to enter into the thing now,'' proceeded
Philip. ' What are you reading 1 '

<p/>^Thucydides.''

<p/>' Have you come to Pericles' oration ? I must show you some
notes that I have on that. Don't you get into the spirit of it
now ? '

<p/>' Up-hill work still,'' answered Guy, disentangling some cliders
from the silky curls of Bustle's ear.

<p/>' Which do you like best -- that or the ball ? ' asked Charles,



<p/>THfi HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 75

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The hay-field best of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Guy, releasing Bustle, and
blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with a heap of hay.

<p/>' Of course ! ' said Charlotte, ' who would not like hay-making
better than that stupid ball ? '

<p/>' Poor Charlotte ! ' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; commiseration
which irritated Charlotte into standing up and protesting,
' Mamma, you know I don't want to go.''

<p/>' No more do I, Charlotte,<div class="bookquote">'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother, in a mock con-
soling tone. ' You and I know what is good for us, and despise
sublunary vanities.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>' But you will go, Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ; ' Philip is really going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' In spite of Lord Kilcoran's folly in going to such an expense
as either taking Allonby or giving the ball,'' said Charles.

<p/>' I don't think it is my business to bring Lord Kilcoran to a
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) folly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' I made all my protests to Maurice
when first he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) started the notion, but if his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father chose to take
the matter up, it is no concern of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Kilcoran/Kilcoran</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will understand, Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `tliat this ball is
specially got up by Maurice for Laura's benefit.''

<p/>' Believe as little as you please of that speech, Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ;
`the truth is, that Lord Kilcoran is very good-natured, and
Eveleen was very much shocked to hear that Amy had never been
to any ball, and I to only one, and so it ended in their giving one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>that speech Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' When is it to be ?''

<p/>' On Thursday week,'' said Amy. ' I Avonder if you Avill think
Eveleen as pretty as we do ! '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) is Laura's great friend, is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) very much ; I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) all my life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
has much more depth than those would think who only know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
manner.'' And Laura looked pleadingly at Philip as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>' Are there any others of the family at home ? ' said Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The two younger girls, Mabel and Helen, and the little
boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, ' Lord de Courcy is in Ireland, and all the
otliers are away.''

<p/>' Lord de Courcy is the wisest man of the family, and sets his (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>)
face against absenteeism,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is never visible here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><p/>' But you aren't going to despise it, I hope, Guy,'' said Amy,
earnestly ; ' it will be so delightful ! And what fun we shall
have in teaching you to dance ! '

<p/>Guy stretched himself, and gave a quaint grunt.

<p/>' Never mind, Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' very little is required. You
may easily pass in the crowd. I never learnt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Your ear will guide you,'' said Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And no one can stay at home, since Mary Ross is going,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. ' Eveleen was always so fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) came
and forced a promise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) should come
with mamma, and have no trouble.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not seen Allonby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura. <div class="bookquote">``There are such
Vandykes, and among them, such a King Charles ! '

<p/>' Is not that the picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Charles, ' before which Amy -- '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O don't, Charlie!^

<p/>' Was found dissolved in tears V

<p/>' I could not help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured Amy, blushing crimson.

<p/>' There is all Charles's fate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, -- ' earnest,
melancholy, beautiful ! It would stir the feelings -- were it an
unknown portrait. No, Amy, you need not be ashamed of your
tears.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>But Amy turned away, doubly ashamed,

<p/>' I hope it is not in the ball-room,'' said Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, ' it is in the library.''

<p/>Charlotte, whose absence had become perceptible from the
general quietness, here ran up with two envelopes, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) put
into Guy's hands. One contained Lady Kilcoran's genuine card
of invitation for Sir Guy Morville, the other Charlotte had
scribbled in haste for Mr. Bustle.

<p/>This put an end to all rationality. Guy rose with a growl
and a roar, and hunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) over half the field, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
caught, and came back out of breath and screaming, ' We never
had such a haymaking ! '

<p/>' So I think the haymakers will say ! ' answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother,
rising to go indoors. ' What ruin of haycocks ! '

<p/>' Oh, I'll set all that to rights,'' said Guy, seizing a hay-fork.

<p/>' Stop, stop, take care ! ' cried Charles. ' I don't want to be
built up in the rick, and by and by, Avhen my disconsolate family
have had all the ponds dragged for me, Deloraine will be heard
to complain tliat they give him (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>) very odd animal food ! '

<p/>' Who could resist such a piteous appeal ! ' said Guy, helping
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to rise, and conducting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wheeled chair. The
others followed, and when, shortly after, Laura looked out at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saw Guy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) coat off, toiling like a real hay-
maker, to build up the cocks in all their neat fairness and height,
whistling meantime the ' Queen of the May,'' and now and then
singing a line. She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) watched the old cowman come up, touching
his (<font color='blue'><b>cowman</b></font>) hat, and looking less cross than usual ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) saw Guy's ready
greeting, and perceived they were comparing tlie forks and rakes,
the pooks and cocks of their counties ; and, finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) beheld
her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) father ride into the field, and Guy spring to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>No one could liave so returned to what was in effect a home,
unless his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) time had been properly spent ; and, in fact, all that
Mr. Edmonstone or Philip could hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was so satisfactory,
that Philip pronounced that the first stage of the trial had
been passed irreproachably, and Laura felt and looked delighted
at this sanction to the high estimation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) held him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own account of himself to Mrs. Edmonstone would not
have been equally satisfactory if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had not had something else
to check it with. It was given by degrees, and at many different
times, chiefly as they walked round the garden in the twilight
of the summer evenings, talking over the many subjects men-
tioned in the letters which had passed constantly. It seemed as
if tliere were very few to whom Guy would ever give his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conli-

<p/>dence ; but that once bestowed, it was with liardly any reserve,
and that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) great relief and satisfaction to pour out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
whole mind, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was sure of sympathy.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confided how much provoked he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was with
himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ' first term,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, ' having only shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) what

a hasty vehement manner, which had caused offence, and for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) blamed himself. It had been the same with other
things, till he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had left himself no regular recreation but walking

He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had resumed light reading, too, which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had nearly discon-

was bent on friendship with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; if, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
out to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the son of that Captain Wellwood whose
death had weighed so heavily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grandfather's conscience,
feeling almost as if it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) duty to ask forgiveness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
grandfather's name, yet scarcely knowing how to venture on
advances to one to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name had such associations. How-
ever, they had gradually drawn together, and at length entered
on the subject, and Guy then found he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the nephew, not the
son of Captain Wellwood ; indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) former belief was founded
on a miscalculation, as the duel had taken place tAventy-eight
years ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) now heard all his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grandfather had wished to
know of the family. There were two unmarried daughters, and
their cousin spoke in the highest terms of their self -de voted life,
promising what Guy much wished, that they should hear what
deep repentance had followed the crime which had made them
fatherless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was to be a clergyman, and Guy admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
extremely, saying, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so shy and retiring, it
was hard to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) well.

<p/>From not having been at school, and from other causes, Guy
had made few acquaintance ; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) amused Mrs. Edmonstone
by fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been morose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was ready to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was an ingenious self -tormentor ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw that the struggle
to do right was the main spring of the happiness that beamed



<p/>78 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>round him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) self-reproach, heart-felt as it was.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) doubted whether persons more contented with themselves
were as truly joyous, and was convinced that, while thus com-
bating lesser temptations, the very shadow of what are generally
alone considered as real temptations would hardly come near him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>If it had not been for these talks, and now and then a
thoughtful look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one of the most
light-hearted and merriest of beings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was more full of glee
and high spirits than she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed to fill
the whole house with mirth, and keep every one alive by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fun
and frolic, as blithe and untiring as Maurice de Courcy himself,
though not so wild.

<p/>Very pleasant were those summer days -- reading, walking,
music, gardening. Did not they all work like very labourers at
the new arbour in the midst of the laurels, where Charles might
sit and see the spires of Broadstone 1 Work they did, indeed !
Charles looking on from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wheeled chair, laughing to see Guy
sawing as if for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) living, and Amy hammering gallantly, and
Laura weaving osiers, and Charlotte flying about with messages.

<p/>One day, they were startled by an exclamation from Charles.
' Ah, ha ! Paddy, is that you ? ' and beheld the tall figure of a
girl, advancing with a rapid, springing step, holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
riding habit with one hand, with the other whisking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coral-
handled whip. There was something distinguished in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) air,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features, though less fine than Laura's, were very pretty,
by the help of laughing dark blue eyes, and very black hair,
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) broad hat and little waving feather. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) threatened
Charles with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) whip, calling out -- ' Aunt Edmonstone said I
should find you here. What is the fun now ? '

<p/>' Arbour building,'' said Charles ; ' don't you see the head
carpenter ! '

<p/>' Sir Guy 1 ' whispered she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to Laura, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was mounted on the roof, thatching it with reed, the
sunshine full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) glowing face and white shirt sleeves.

<p/>' Here ! ' said Charles, as Guy swung himself down with a
bound, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face much redder than sun and work had already
made it, ' here's another wild Irisher for you.''

<p/>' Sir Guy Morville -- Lady Eveleen de Courcy,'' began Laura ;
but Lady Eveleen cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) short, frankly holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) hand,
and saying, ``You are almost a cousin, you know. Oh, don't
leave off*. Do give me something to do. That hammer, Amy,
pray -- Laura, don't you remember how dearly I always loved
hammering ? '

<p/>' How did you come ? ' said Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``With papa-- `tis his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) visit to Sir_ Guy. No, don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>as
Guy began to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) coat ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is only impending. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is
gone on to Broadstone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dropped me here, and will pick
me up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way back. Can't you give me something to do on
the top of tliat ladder ? I should like it mightily ; it looks so
cool and airy,''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 79

<p/>' How can you, Eva ? ' whispered Laura, reprovingly ; but
Lady Eveleen only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), and declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
saw a dangerous nail sticking out, began to hammer it in with
such good will, that Charles stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ears, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) it was
worse than her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) tongue. ' Go on about the ball, do.''

<p/>' Oh,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) earnestly, ' do you think there is any hope of
Captain Morville's coming 1 '

<p/>' Oh yes,'' said Laura.

<p/>' I am so glad ! That is what papa is gone to Broadstone
about. Maurice said he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) such a lecture, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>)
would not be the one to think of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>), and papa must do
it himself ; for if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) sets his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) face against it, it will spoil it all.''^

<p/>' You may make your mind easy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' the captain is
lenient, and looks on the ball as a mere development of Irish
nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has been consoling Guy on the difficulties of dancing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Can't you dance ? ' said Lady Eveleen, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with
compassion.

<p/>' Such is my melancholy ignorance,'' said Guy.

<p/>' We have been talking of teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),'' said Laura.

<p/>' Talk ! will that do it 1 ' cried Lady Eveleen, springing up.
' We will begin this moment. Come out on the lawn. Here,
Charles,'' wheeling him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) along. ``No, thank you, I like it,<div class="bookquote">'' as
Guy was going to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). ' There, Charles, be fiddler ; go on,
tum -- turn, tee ! that'll do. Amy, Laura, be ladies. I'm the
other gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) stuck on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hat in military style,
giving it a cock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) actually set them quadrilling in spite of
adverse circumstances, dancing better, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) habit, than most
people without one, till Lord Kilcoran arrived.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) walked a little apart, arm-
in-arm with Laura. <div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said ; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) looks
up to anything. I had heard so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) steadiness, that it
is a great relief to my mind to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) so unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) cousin.''

<p/>' Eveleen ! '

<p/>' No disparagement to the captain, only I am so dreadfully
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) thinks me such an unmitigated
goose. Now, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you would but take the right way to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think
otherwise, dear Eva, and show the sense you really have.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just what my fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) won't let me do. I would
not for the world let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guess it, so there is nothing for it but
sauciness to cover one's weakness. I can't be sensible with
those that won't give me credit for it. But you'll mind and
teach Sir Guy to dance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has so much spring in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
deserves to be an Irishman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In compliance with this injunction, there used to be a clear-
ance every evening ; Charles turned into the bay window out
of the way, Mrs. Edmonstone at the jDiano, and the rest figuring
away, the partnerless one, called `puss in the corner,'' being
generally Amabel, while Charlotte, disdaining them all the
time, used to try to make tliem imitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dancing-master's



<p/>80 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>graces, causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father to perform such caricatures of them
as to overpower all with laughing.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone was half Irish. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother, Lady Mabel
Edmonstone, had never thoroughly taken root in England, and
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) marriage, had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter to live near her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) old
home in Ireland. The present Earl of Kilcoran was her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew,
and a very close intercourse had always been kept up between
the families, Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone being adopted by their
younger cousins as uncle and aunt, and always so called.

<p/>The house at Allonby was in such confusion, that the family
there expected to dine nowhere on the day of the ball ; and the
Hollywell party thought it prudent to secure their dinner at
home, with Philip and Mary Ross, who were to go with them.

<p/>By special desire, Philip wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uniform ; and while the
sisters were dressing Charlotte gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a thorough examination,
which led to a talk between him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and Mary on accoutrements and
weapons in general ; but while deep in some points of chivalrous
armour^ Mary's waist was pinched by two mischievous hands,
and a little fluttering white figure danced around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>' O Amy ! what do you want with me ? '

<p/>' Come and be trimmed up,'' said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you told me I was to have no trouble. I am
dressed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div>said Mary, looking complacently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) full folds of
white muslin.

<p/>' No more you shall ; but you promised to do as you were
told.'' And Amy fluttered away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, `the comparison of Rose
Flammock dragging off her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father, to a little carved cherub
trying to uplift a solid monumental hero 1 '

<p/>' O, I must tell Mary ! ' cried Charlotte ; but Philip stopped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with orders not to be a silly child.

<p/>' It is a pity Amy should not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) share,'' said Charles.

<p/>' The comparison to a Dutch cherub ? ' asked Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is more after the pattern of the little things on little
wings, in your blotting-book,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; ' certain lines in the
predicament of the cherubs of painters -- heads et j^rceterea nihil.''

<p/>' O Guy, do you write verses ? ' cried Charlotte.

<p/>' Some nonsense,'' muttered Guy, out of countenance ; ' I
thought I had made away with that rubbish ; where is it ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the blotting-book in my room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``I must
explain that the book is my property, and was put into your
room when mamma was beautifying it for you, as new and
strange company. On its return to me, at your departure, I
discovered a great accession of blots and sailing vessels, beside
the aforesaid little things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I shall resume my own property,'' said Guy, departing in haste.

<p/>Charlotte ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), to beg for a sight of it ; and Philip
asked Charles what it was like.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A romantic incident,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `just fit for a novel. A
Petrarch leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) poems about in blotting-books,''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 81

<p/>Charles used the word Petrarch to stand for a poet, not
thinking what lady's name lie suggested ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was surprised
at the severity of Philip's tone as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) inquired,

<p/>' Do you mean anything, or do you not ? '

<p/>Perceiving with delight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had perplexed and teased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
rejoiced in keeping up the mystery :

<p/>' Eh ? is it a tender subject with you, too ? '

<p/>Philip rose, and standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), said, in a low but im-
pressive tone :

<p/>' I cannot tell whether you are trifling or not ; but you are
no boy now, and can surely see that this is no subject to be
played with. If you are concealing anything you have dis-
covered, you have a great deal to answer for. I can liardly
imagine anything more unfortunate than that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should become
attached to either of your sisters.''

<p/>' Et pourquoi 1 ' asked Charles, coolly.

<p/>' I see,'' said Philip, retreating to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) chair, and speaking with
great composure, <div class="bookquote">``I did you injustice by speaking seriously.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle came into the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked some indifferent
question, without betraying a shade of annoyance.

<p/>Charles meanwhile congratulated himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) valour in
keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) counsel, in spite of so tall a man in scarlet ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was much nettled at the last speech ; for if a real attachment
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister had been in question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would never have trifled
about it. Keenly alive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin's injustice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rejoiced in
having provoked and mystified the impassible, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) little
knew the storm he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had raised beneath that serene exterior of
perfect self-command.

<p/>The carriages were announced, and Mr. Edmonstone began to
call the ladies, adding tenfold to the confusion in the dressing-
room. There was Laura being completed by the lady's maid,
Amabel embellishing Mary, Mrs. Edmonstone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arm
loaded with shawls, Charlotte flourishing about. Poor Mary --
it was much against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will -- but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no heart to refuse
the wreath of geraniums that Amy's own hands had woven for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat, passive as a doll, though in despair at
their all waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). For Laura's toilette was finished, and
every one began dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) at once ; while Charlotte, to make
it better, screamed over the balusters that all were ready but
Mary. Sir Guy was heard playing the <div class="bookquote">``Harmonious Black-
smith,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>and Captain Morville's step was heard, fast and firm.
At last, when a long chain was put round her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cried
out, ' I have submitted to everything so far ; I can bear no
more ! ' jumped up, caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) shawl, and was putting
it on, when there was a general outcry that they must exhibit
themselves to Charles.

<p/>They all ran down, and Amy, flying up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother, made
a splendid sweeping curtsey, and twirled round in a pirouette.

<p/>' Got up regardless of expense ! ' cried Charles ; ' display
yourselves.''

<p/>G



<p/>82 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>The young ladies ranged themselves in imitation of the book
of fashions. The sisters were in white, with wreaths of starry
jessamine. It was particularly becoming to Laura's bella-donna
lily complexion, rich brown curls, and classical features ; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother exclaimed :

<p/>' Laura is exactly like Apollo playing the lyre, outside mamma's
old manuscript book of music'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has not Amy made beautiful wreaths?''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>said Laura. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
stripped tlie tree, and Guy had to fetch the ladder, to gather
the sprays on the top of the wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you see your bit of myrtle, Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, pointing to
it, on Laura's head, ' that you tried to persuade me would pass
for jessamine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! it should have been all myrtle,'' said Guy.

<p/>Philip leant meantime against the door. Laura only once
glanced towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), thinking all this too trifling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and
never imagining the intense interest with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gave a
meaning to each word and look.

<p/>' Well done, Mary ! ' cried Charles, ' they have furbished you
up handsomely.''

<p/>Mary made a face, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should wonder who was the
fashionable young lady she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should meet in the pier-glasses at
Allonby. Then Mr. Edmonstone hurried them away, and they
arrived in due time.

<p/>The saloon at Allonby was a beautiful room, one end opening
into a conservatory, full of coloured lamps, fresh green leaves,
and hot-house plants. There they found as yet only the home
party, the good-natured, merry Lord Kilcoran, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) quiet English
wife, who had bad health, and looked hardly equal to the con-
fusion of the evening ; Maurice, and two younger boys ; Eveleen,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two little sisters, Mabel and Helen.

<p/>' This makes it hard on Charlotte,'' thought Amy, while the
two girls dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) off to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) the lamps in the conser-
vatory ; and the rest attacked Mrs. Edmonstone for not having
brought Charlotte, reproaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) with hardness of heart of
which they had never believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) capable -- Lady Eveleen, in
especial, talking with that exaggeration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ordinary manner
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) dread of Captain Mor\dlle made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) assume. Little
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) recked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was absorbed in observing how far Laura's
conduct coincided with Charles's hints. On the first oppor-
tunity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to dance, and was satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
pleased acquiescence ; but the next moment Guy came up, and
in an eager manner made the same request.

<p/>' I am engaged,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), with a bright, proud glance at Philip ;
and Guy pursued Amabel into the conservatory, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) met
with better success. Mr. Edmonstone gallantly asked Mary if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was too old a partner, and was soon dancing with the step and
spring that had once made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) the best dancer in the county.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) flock, proud and pleased,
thinking how well they looked, and that, in especial, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 83

<p/>never been sensible how much Laura's and Philip's good looks
excelled the rest of the world. They were much alike in the
remarkable symmetry both of figure and feature, the colour of
the deep blue eye, and fairness of complexion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is curious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Edmonstone, `that, so very hand-
some as Philip is, it is never the first thing remarked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
just as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) height never is observed till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is compared with other
people. The fact is, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) superior sense carries oft' a degree
of beauty which would be a misfortune to most men. It is that
sedate expression and distinguished air that make the impres-
sion. How happy Laura looks, how gracefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) moves. No, it
is not being foolish to think no one equal to Laura. My other
pair ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) smiled much more ; ' you happy young things, I
would not wish to see anything pleasanter than your merry faces.
Little Amy looks almost as pretty as Laura, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is lighted
up by blush and smile, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) dancing is very nice ; it is just
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) laughing, so quiet, and yet so full of glee. I don't think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is less graceful than her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sister, but the complete enjoyment
strikes one more. And as to enjoyment -- there are those bright
eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) partner's perfectly sparkling with delight ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looks
as if it was a world of enchantment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Never had any
one a greater capacity for happiness than Guy.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone might well retain her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) opinion when, after
the quadrille, Guy came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never seen any-
thing so delightful ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entertained Mary Ross with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
fresh, joyous pleasure, through the next dance.

<p/>' Laura,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered Eveleen, ' I've one ambition. Do you
guess it ? Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would, I should have a
better opinion of myself ever after. I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)'ll depreciate
me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) friend ; and really with Mr. Thorndale, I was no
more foolish than a ball requires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Lady Eveleen hoped in vain. Captain Morville danced with
little Lady Helen, a child of eleven, who was enchanted at
having so tall a partner ; then, after standing still for some
time, chose his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) cousin Amabel.

<p/>' You are a good partner and neighbour,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) arm, ' you don't want young lady talk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbour</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you not have asked Mary? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has been sitting
down this long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cares for such a sport as dancing 1 '

<p/>Amy made no answer.

<p/>' You have been well off. You were dancing with Thorndale
just now.''

<p/>' Yes. It was refreshing to have an old acquaintance among
so many strangers. And he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is so delighted with Eveleen ; but
what is more, Philip, that Mr. Vernon, who is dancing with

<p/>' Look round, Amy, and you will see many a face which speaks
of intellect wasted, or, if cultivated, turned aside from its true
purpose, like the double blossom, which bears leaves alone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! you forget you are talking to silly little Amy, I can't see all
that. I had rather think people as happy and good as they look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Keep your child-like temper as long as you can -- all your life,<div class="bookquote">''
perhaps, for this is one of the points where it is folly to be wise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you only meant things in general ? Nothing about Laura 1 '

<p/>' Things in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>repeated Philip ; ' bright promises blighted
or thrown away '

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke absently, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eye was following Laura.

<p/>Amy thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister, and was sorry for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke no more, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not regret it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could
not moralize in such a scene, and the sight and the dancing were
pleasure enough.

<p/>Guy, in the meantime, had met an Oxford acquaintance, who
introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sisters -- pretty girls -- whose father Mr.
Edmonstone knew, but who was rather out of the Hollywell
visiting distance. They fell into conversation quickly, and the
Miss Alstons asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) with some interest, <div class="bookquote">``Which was the
pretty Miss Edmonstone 1 ' Guy looked for the sisters, as if to
make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, for the fact was, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first knew
Laura and Amy, the idea of criticising beauty had not entered
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, and to compare them was quite a new notion. ' Nay,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) at last, `if you cannot discover for yourselves when
they are both before your eyes, I will do nothing so invidious
as to say which is the pretty one. I'll tell which is the eldest and
which the youngest, but the rest you must decide for yourself.''

<p/>' I should like to know them,<div class="bookquote">'' said Miss Alston. ' Oh ! they
are both very nice-looking girls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' There, that is Laura -- Miss Edmonstone,^ said Guy, ' that
tall young lady, with the beautiful hair and jessamine wreath.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and had a property in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). The tone did not escape Philip, who at that moment was
close to them, with Amy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arm ; and, knowing the Alstons
slightly, stopped and spoke, and introduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin. Miss
Amabel Edmonstone. At the same time Guy took one of the
Miss Alstons away to get some tea.

<p/>' So you knew my cousin at Oxford V said Philip, to the brother,

<p/>' Yes, slightly. What an amusing fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something very bright, very unlike other people
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Alston</b></font>)</div>said Miss Alston.

<p/>' How does he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) get on 1 Is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) liked ? '

<p/>' Why, yes, I should say so, on the whole ; but it is rather as
my sister says, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not like other people.''

<p/>' In what respect ? '

<p/>' Oh ! I can hardly tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a very pleasant person, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
ought to have been at school. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a man of crotchets.''

self. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is a man of one friend, and I don't see much of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

<p/>Another dance began, Mr. Alston went to look for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alston</b></font>) partner,
Philip and Amy moved on in search of ice. ' Hum ! ' said Philip
to himself, causing Amy to gaze up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was musing
too intently for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to venture on a remark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was thinking
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not wonder that strangers deemed Guy crotchety,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so difficult to understand ; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) considered
whether to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to see King Charles, in the library, and
concluded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would wait, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt as if the martyr
king's face would look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) too gravely to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) present tone.

<p/>Philip helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to ice, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's
neighbourhood without many more words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) then stood
thoughtful for some time, entered into conversation with one of
the elder gentlemen, and, when that was interrupted, turned to
talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>Lady Eveleen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) two cousins were for a moment to-
gether. ' What is the matter, Eva ? ' said Amy, seeing a sort of
dissatisfaction on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bright face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The roc's egg?''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``The queen of the
evening can't be content '

<p/>' No ; you are the queen, if the one thing can make you so --
the one thing wanting to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eva</b></font>)</div><p/>' How absurd you are, Eva -- when you say you are so afraid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), too.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the very reason. I should get a better opinion of
myself ! Besides, there is nobody else so handsome. I declare
I'll make a bold attempt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! you don't think of such a thing,'' cried Laura, very
much shocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Eveleen, `faint heart, you know.<div class="bookquote">'' And
with a nod, a ilourish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) bouquet, and an arch smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
cousin's horror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) moved on, and presently they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
exclaiming, gaily, ' Captain Morville, I really must scold you.
You are setting a shocking example of laziness ! Aunt Edmon-
stone, how can you encourage such proceedings ! Indolence is
the parent of vice, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip smiled just as much as the occasion required, and
answered, ' I beg your pardon, I had forgotten my duty. I'll
attend to my business better in future.'' And turning to a
small, shy damsel, who seldom met with a partner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>)
to dance. Eveleen came back to Laura with a droll disappointed
gesture. <div class="bookquote">``Insult to injury,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), disconsolately.

<p/>' Of course,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not have thought you wanted
to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), or you would not have gone to stir him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was very obtuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Besides, you are engaged.''

<p/>' O yes, to Mr. Thorndale ! But who would be content with
the squire when the knight disdains her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)?''



<p/>86 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Mr. Thorndale came to claim Eveleen at that moment. It
was the second time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>), and it did not
pass unobserved by Philip, nor the long walk up and down after
the dance was over. At length his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and said something warm in admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) is very
Irish,'' was Philip's answer, with a cold smile, and Mr. Thorndale
stood uncomfortable under the disapprobation, attracted by
Eveleen's beauty and grace, yet so unused to trust his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) own judg-
ment apart from ' Morville<div class="bookquote">``s,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as to be in an instant doubtful
vvhether he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) really admired or not.

<p/>' You have not been dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) 1 ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) said, presently.

<p/>' No : she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) attracts too many to need the attention of a nobody
like myself.''

<p/>That ' too many,'' seeming to confound him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) with the vulgar
herd, made Mr. Thorndale heartily ashamed of having been
pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>).

<p/>Philip was easy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for the present, satisfied that
admiration had been checked, which, if it had been allowed to
grow into an attachment, would have been very undesirable.

<p/>The suspicions Charles had excited were so full in Philip's
mind, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not as easily set it at rest respecting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin. Guy had three times asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) to dance, but each
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had been engaged. At last, just as the clock struck
the hour at which the carriage had been ordered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came up,
and impetuously claimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``One quadrille we must have,
Laura, if you are not tired ? '

<p/>' No ! Oh, no ! I could dance till this time to-morrow\'

<p/>' We ought to be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' O pray, Mrs. Edmonstone, this one more,<div class="bookquote">'' cried Guy, eagerly.
' Laura owes me this one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, this one more, mamma,'' said Laura, and they went off
together, while Philip remained, in a reverie, till requested by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt to see if the carriage was ready.

<p/>The dance was over, the carriage was waiting, but Guy and
Laura did not appear till, after two or three minutes spent in
wonder and inquiries, they came quietly walking back from the
library, where they had been looking at King Charles.

<p/>All the way home the four ladies in the carriage never ceased
laughing and talking. The three gentlemen in theirs acted
diversely. Mr. Edmonstone went to sleep, Philip sat in silent
thought, Guy whistled and hummed the tunes, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
foot very much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was still dancing.

<p/>They met for a moment, and parted again in the hall at
Hollywell, where the daylight was striving to get in through the
closed shutters. Philip went on to Broadstone, Guy said lie
could not go to Tjed by daylight, called Bustle, and went to the
river to bathe, and the rest crept upstairs to their rooms. And
so ended Lord Kilcoran's ball



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 87



<p/>CHAPTER YIII

<p/>Like Alexander, I will reign,

<p/>And I will reign alone,
My thoughts shall ever more disdain

<p/>A rival near my throne.
But I must rule and govern still,

<p/>And always give the law,
And have each subject at my will,

<p/>And all to stand in awe.-- Montrose.

<p/>One very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Mor-
ville walked to Hollywell, accelerating his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pace under the
influence of anxious reflections.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest •
but in spite of Guy's extreme youth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feared there was ground
for the suspicion excited by the hint, and was persuaded that
such an attachment could produce nothing but unhappiness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
cousin, considering how little confidence could be placed in Guy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perceived that there was much to inspire affection -- attrac-
tive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent for music, and now
this recently discovered power of versifying, all were in Guy's
favour, besides the ancient name and long ancestry, which con-
ferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with a feudal feeling as head of the family. There was also
the familiar intercourse to increase the danger ; and Philip, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) reflected on these things, trembled for Laura, and felt himself
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) only protector ; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone
was infatuated, and Charles would not listen to reason. To
make everything worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had that morning heard that there
was to be a grand inspection of the regiment, and a presenta-
tion of colours ; Colonel Deane was very anxious ; and it was
plain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little
leisure. The whole affair was to end with a ball, which would
lead to a repetition of what had already disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/>Thus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the
smooth green enclosure of Hollywell. Everything, save the
dancing clouds of insect youth which whirled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face, was
drooping in the heat. The house -- every door and window
opened -- seemed gasping for breath ; the cows sought refuge in
the shade ; the pony drooped its head drowsily ; the leaves hung
wearily ; the flowers were faint and thirsty ; and Bustle was
stretched on the stone steps, mouth open, tongue out, only his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
tail now and then moving, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) put back his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) ears and crested
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) head to greet the arrival. Philip heard the sounds tliat had
caused the motion of the sympathizing tail -- the rich tones of
Guy's voice. Stepping over the dog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entered, and heard
more clearly --

<p/>' Two loving hearts may sever,
For sorrow fails them never.*

<p/>And then another ypiceT--



<p/>88 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Who knows not love in sorrow's night,
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knows not love in light.''

<p/>In the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade
of the Venetian blinds of the bay window, stood Laura, leaning
on the piano, close to Guy, who sat on the music-stool, looking
thoroughly at home in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied
handkerchief.

<p/>Any one but Philip would have been out of temper, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
shook hands as cordially as usual, and would not even be the
first to remark on the heat.

<p/>Laura told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked hot and tired, and invited liim to
come out to the others, and cool himself on the lawn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
went for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) parasol, Guy ran for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) camp stool, and Philip,
going to the piano, read what they had been singing. Tlie
lines were in Laura's writing, corrected, here and there, in Guy's
hand.

<p/>BE STEADFAST.

<p/>Two loving hearts may sever,

<p/>Yet love shall fail them never.

<p/>Love brightest beams in sorrow's night,

<p/>Love is of life the light.

<p/>Two loving hearts may sever,
Yet hope shall fail them never.
Hope is a star in sorrow's night,
Forget-me-not of light.

<p/>Two loving hearts may sever,
Yet faith may fail them never.
Tnist on through sorrow's night,
Faith is of love and hope the light.

<p/>Two loving hearts may sever,

<p/>For sorrow fails them never.

<p/>Wlio knows not love in sorrow's night.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knows not love in light.

<p/>Philip was by no means pleased. However, it was in anything
but a sentimental manner that Guy, looking over him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), said,
``For sever, read, be separated, but ``a<div class="bookquote">'' wouldn't rhyme.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ;
' I hope you approve of our performance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is that thing of Helmine von Chezy, Beharre, is it not ? '
said Philip, particularly civil, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was so much annoyed.
' You have rendered the spirit very well ; but you have sacrificed
a good deal to your double rhymes.''

<p/>' Yes ; those last lines are not troubled with any equality of
feet,'' said Guy ; `but the repetition is half the beauty. It put
me in mind of those lines of Burns--

<p/><div class="bookquote">'' Had we never loved so kindly.
Had we never loved so blindly,
Never met and never parted,
We had ne'er been broken hearted ; ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>but there is a trust in these that is more touching than that
despair.''

<p/>' Yes ; the despair is ready to wish tlie love liad never been,''

<p/>said Laura. ' It does not see the star of trust. Wliy did you
use that word <div class="bookquote">'' trust ''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>only once, Guy 1 '

<p/>' I did not want to lose the three -- faith, hope, love, -- faith
keeping the other two alive.''

<p/>' My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.''

<p/>' Surely,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, eagerly, ' that analogy must be the best
part of earthly love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all
the afternoon ; and they went out. They found the others in tlie
arbour, and Charlotte's histories of its construction gave Philip
little satisfaction. They next proceeded to talk over the ball,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! ' said Philip, `balls are the fashion just now. What do
you say, Amy, -LSB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was more inclined to patronize her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) than any
one else-RSB- to the gaieties we are going to provide for you 1 '

<p/>' You ! Are you going to have your new colours 1 Oh ! you
are not going to give us a ball 1 '

<p/>' Well ! that is fun ! ' cried Guy. ' What glory Maurice de
Courcy must be in ! '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is gone to Allonby,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Philip, ' to announce it ; saying,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father to put off their going to Brighton.
Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will succeed 1 '

<p/>' Hardly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ; ' poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked
up by their ball, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) is the more in want of sea air. Oh,
mamma, Eva must come and stay here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' That she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) must,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' that will make it
easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is the only one who will care about the ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip was obliged to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) vexation, and to answer the
many eager questions about the arrangements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stayed to
dinner, and as the others went in-doors to dress, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lingered near
Charlotte, assuming, with some difficulty, an air of indifference,
and said -- ' Well, Charlotte, did you tease Guy into sliowing you
those verses 1 '

<p/>' Oh yes,'' said Charlotte, with what the French call 2m air
capable.

<p/>' Well, what were they 1 '

<p/>' That I mustn't tell. They were very pretty ; but I've
promised.''

<p/>' Promised what ? '

<p/>' Never to say anything about them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made it a condition
with me, and I assure you, I am to be trusted.''

<p/>' Right,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' I'll ask no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It would be of no use,'' said Charlotte, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) head, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) further.

<p/>Philip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to come and look over the plans
of an estate adjoining Redclyfie, which there was some idea of
purchasing. Such an employment would in general have been
congenial ; but on this occasion, it was only by a strong force
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could chain his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) attention, for Guy was pacing the ter-
race with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and repassed



<p/>90 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now and then caught sounds of repeating
poetry.

<p/>In this Guy excelled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not read aloud well ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was too
rapid, and eyes and thoughts were apt to travel still faster than
the lips, thus producing a confusion ; but no one could recite
better when a passage had taken strong hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) imagination,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gave it the full effect of the modulations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fine voice,
conveying in its inflections the impressions which stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
profoundly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was just now enchanted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first reading
of ' Thalaba,'' where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found all manner of deep meanings, to
which the sisters listened with wonder and delight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repeated,
in a low, awful, thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the lines
in the seventh book, ending with --

<p/>Who comes from the bridal chamber !
It is Azrael, angel of death,

<p/>' You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram.''
said Laura.

<p/>' It is like Sintram,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) replied.

<p/>' Like it ? '

<p/>' So it seems to me. A strife with the powers of darkness ; the
victory, forgiveness, resignation, death.

<p/>' Thou know`st the secret wishes of my heart,
Do witli me as thou wilt, thy will is best.''

<p/>' I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,<div class="bookquote">''
said Amy ; ' you bring the whole Domdaniel round us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as
Sintram,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura. ' But you know Southey did not see all
this himself, and did not understand it when it was jDointed out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sintram</b></font>)</div><p/>' Don't tell us that,'' said Amy.

<p/>' Nay ; I think there is something striking in it,'' said Guy
then, with a sudden transition, ' but is not this ball famous 1 '

<p/>And their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o'clock, when
they were summoned to tea.

<p/>On the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means
comforted.

<p/>Never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) known so much difhculty in attending with
patience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) duties as in the course of the next fortnight. They
became a greater durance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at length looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings full
in the face, and became aware of their true nature.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) perceived that the loss of Laura would darken his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) whole
existence ; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought that, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only secure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hap-
piness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could have resigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) in silence. Guy was, however,
one of tlie last men in the world whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could bear to see in
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; and probably slie was allowing herself to be
entangled, if not in heart, at least in manner. If so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) should
not be unwarned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) guide from childhood, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) now.

<p/>Three days before the review, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) succeeded in finding time for
a walk' to Holly well, not fully decided on the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should ac*-,



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 91

<p/>though resolved on making some remonstrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was crossing
a stile, about a mile and a half from Hollywell, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw a
lady sitting on the stump of a tree, sketching, and found that
fate had been so propitious as to send Laura thither alone. The
rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
sketching the view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft be-
tween the high green hills. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and
held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) purple and olive washes to be criticised ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did
not pay much attention to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was almost confused at
the sudden manner in which the opportunity for speaking had
presented itself.

<p/>' It is a long time since I have seen you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An unheard-of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Still longer since we have had any conversation.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just thinking so. Not since that hot hay-making,
when Guy came home. Indeed, we have had so much amuse-
ment lately that I have hardly had time for thought. Guy says
we are all growing dissipated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with
thought.''

<p/>' Poor music 1 ' said Laura, smiling. ' But I am ready for a
lecture ; I have been feeling more like a butterfly than I like.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely con-
fess that I cannot estimate the pleasure it affords, but I doubt
whether it is a safe pleasure. It forms common ground for per-
sons who would otherwise have little in common, and leads to
intimacies which occasion results never looked for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,'' said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim.
_ ' Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly. Is not that a
sign that you were made for better things ? '

<p/>' But what can I do ? I try to read early and at night, but I
can't prevent the fun and gaiety ; and, indeed, I don't think I
would. It is innocent, and we never had such a pleasant summer.
Charlie is so -- so much more equable, and mamma is more easy
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and I can't-help thinking it does them all good, though
I do feel idle.''

<p/>' It is innocent, it is right for a little while,'' said Philip ; ' but
your dissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things.
Laura, what I fear is, that this summer holiday may entangle
you, and so fix your fate as to render your life no holiday. O
Laura ! take care ; know what you are doing ! '

<p/>' What am I doing ? ' asked Laura, with an alarmed look of
ingenuous surprise.

<p/>Never had it been so hard to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) composure as now,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) simplicity forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to come to plainer terms. ' I
must speak,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) continued, `because no one else will. Have you
reflected whither this may tend ? This music, this versifying,
this admitting a stranger so unreservedly into your pursuits ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) understood now, and hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have
given worlds to judge of the face hidden by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) bonnet ; but as



<p/>92 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) spoke on, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) agitation becoming so strong,
that the struggle was perceptible in the forced calmness of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
tone. ' I would not say a word if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were worthy, but Laura --
Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted once ; do not let me see
it again in a way which -- which would give me infinitely more
pain.''

<p/>The faltering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) voice, so resolutely subdued, touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
extremely, and a thrill of exquisite pleasure glanced through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), on hearing confirmed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had long felt, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
taken Margaret's place -- nay, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) now learnt, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was
even more precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) only thought of reassuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>).
' No ; you need never fear that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) has no such thought, I
am sure.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) blushed deeply, but looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) face. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) treats
us both alike ; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hall</b></font>) is so young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' The mischief is not done,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, trying to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
usual tone ; ' I only meant to speak in time. You might let
your manner go too far ; you might even allow your affections
to be involved without knowing it, if you were not on your
guard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Never ! ' said Laura. ' Oh, no ; I could never dream of
that with Guy. I like Guy very much ; I think better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
than you do ; but oh no ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could never be my first and best ;
I could never care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in that way. How could you think
so, Philip?''

<p/>' Laura, I cannot but look on you with what may seem over-
solicitude. Since I lost Fanny, and worse than lost Margaret,
you have been my home ; my first, my most precious interest.
O Laura ! ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not even attempt to conceal the trembling
and tenderness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice, ' could I bear to lose you, to see you
thrown away or clianged -- you, dearest, best of all ? '

<p/>Laura did not turn away her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head this time, but raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
beautiful face, glowing with such a look as had never beamed
there before, while tears rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said, ' Don't speak
of my changing towards you. I never could ; for if there is
anything to care for in me, it is you that have taught it to me.''
If ever face plainly told another that he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) first and best,
Laura's did so now. Away went misgivings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) in happiness too great for speech ; at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not
speak till he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) emotion, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) countenance was
sufficient reply. Even then, in the midst of this flood of ecstasy,
came the thought, ' What have I done 1 '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had gone further than he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had ever intended. It was a
positive avowal of love ; and what would ensue ? Cessation of
intercourse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), endless vexations, the displeasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
family, loss of influence, contempt, and from Mr. Edmonstone,
for the pretensions of a penniless soldier. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) joy was too great
to be damped, but it was rendered cautious. ' Laura, my own ! '
-LRB-wliat deliglit the words gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>),-RRB- ' you have made me very
happy. We know each otlier now, and trust each other for ever.<div class="bookquote">''
' O yes, yes ; notliing can alter what lias grown up with us.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 93

<p/>' It is for ever 1 ' repeated Philip. ' But, Laura, let us be con-
tent with our own knowledge of what we are to each other. Do
not let us call in others to see our happiness.''

<p/>Laura looked surprised, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) always considered any commu-
nication about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) private feelings too sacred to be repeated, and
wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should think the injunction necessary. <div class="bookquote">``I never
can bear to talk about the best kinds of happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ;
' but oh ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sprang up, ' here they come.''

<p/>Poor Mrs. Edmonstone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) walked back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mushroom-
field, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little guessed that words had been spoken which would
give the colouring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter's whole life -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little guessed
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) much-loved and esteemed nephew had betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
confidence !

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) and the girls came up, Philip advanced to meet them,
that Laura might have a few moments to recover, while with an
effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) kept himself from appearing absent in the conversation
that ensued. It was brief ; for having answered some questions
with regard to the doings on the important day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, that
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had met them he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not come on to Hollywell, and
bade them farewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which
renewed the glow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) walked back, trying to look through the dazzling haze of
joy so as to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) situation clearly. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
not to perceive that there had been an absolute declaration of
affection, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had established a private understanding
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin. It was not, however, an engagement, nor did
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at present desire to make it so. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
as yet to marry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was content to wait without a promise,
since that could not add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) entire reliance on Laura. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
could not bear to be rejected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) parents : he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) poverty
would be the sole ground of objection, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was not asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to share it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) believed sincerely that a long, lingering
attachment to himself would be more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) good than a mar-
riage with one who would have been a high prize for worldly
aims, and was satisfied that by winning her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had taken
the only sure means of securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) from becoming attached
to Guy, while secrecy was the only way of preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) inter-
course with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) on the same footing, and exerting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) influence
over the family.

<p/>It was calmly reflected, for Philip's love was tranquil, though
deep and steady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rather sought to preserve Laura as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
was than to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) anything more ; and this very calmness
contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) self-deception on this first occasion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had ever actually swerved from the path of right.

<p/>With an uncomfortable sensation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) met Guy riding home
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, entirely unsuspicious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stopped and talked
of the preparations at Broadstone, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been over the
ground with Maurice de Courcy, and had heard the band.

<p/>' What did you think of it ? ' said Philip, absently.

<p/>' They should keep better time ! - Really, Philip, there is one



<p/>94 THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>fellow with a bugle that ought to be flogged every day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
life ! ' said Guy, making a droll, excruciated face -

<p/>How a few words can change the whole current ot ideas, ilie
band was connected with Philip, therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear to
hear it found fault with, and adduced some one s opinion that
the man in question was one of the best of their musicians.

<p/>Guy could not help shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) shoulders, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) laughed
and said,-- <div class="bookquote">``Then I shall be obliged to take to my heels it 1
meet the rest. Good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, , , i x i • ^ '

<p/>' How conceited they have made that boy about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hne ear,
thought Philip. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is not ashamed to parade his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
music, considering whence it is derived.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>Ah ! county Guy, the hour is nigh.

<p/>The sun has lelt the lea.
The orange flower perfumes the bower,

<p/>The breeze is on the sea.
The hark, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hay, who thrilled all day.

<p/>Sits hushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) partner nigh,
Breeze, bird, and flower, confess the hour.

<p/>But where is county Guy?-- Scott



<p/>How was it meantime with Laura 1 The others were laugh-
ing and talking round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), but all seemed lost m the transcend-
ent beam that had shone out on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). To be told by Philip that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had always been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ! This one
idea pervaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)-- too glorious, too happy for utterance almost
for distinct thought. The softening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice, and the look
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), recurred again and again,
startling her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the
first moment. Of the future Laura thought not. Never had a
promise of love been made Avith less knowledge of what it
amounted to : it seemed merely an expression of sentiments that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had never been without ; for had she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) not always looked up
to Philip more than any other living creature, and gloried m
being his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) favourite cousin ? Ever since the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ex-
plained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) the plates in the Encyclopaedia, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
read <div class="bookquote">``Joyce's Scientific Dialogues,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when Amy took fright at
the first page. That this might lead further did not occur to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) • she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was eighteen ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had no experience, not even- in
novels • she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had done ; and above all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had so learnt to surrender her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) opinions to Philip, and to
beheve him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) always right, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would never have ch-eamt of
questioning wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might choose to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Even the
caution of secrecy did not alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wondered that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought it required, safe as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confidence always was with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) Mrs. Edmonstone had been so much occupied by Charles s
illness as to have been unable to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) daughters m
their girlish days ; and in the governess's time the habit had



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 95

<p/>been disused of flying at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with every joy or grief.
Laura's thoughts were not easy of access, and Philip had long
been all in all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was too ignorant of life to perceive
that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) duty to make this conversation known ; or,
more truly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mind to consider that any-
thing could be wrong that Philip desired.

<p/>On coming home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own room, and sitting
by the open window, gave herself up to that delicious dream of
new-found joy.

<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) still sat when Amy came in, opening the door
softly, and treading lightly and airily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) entered, bringing
two or three roses of different tints.

<p/>' Laura ! not begun to dress 1 '

<p/>' Is it time 1 '

<p/>' Shall I answer you according to what Philip calls my note
of time, and tell you the pimpernels are closed, and the tigridias
dropping their leaves ? It would be a proper answer for you ;
you look as if you were in Fairy Land.''

<p/>' Is papa come home ? '

<p/>' Long ago ! and Guy too. Why, where could you have been,
not to have heard Guy and Eveleen singing the Irish melodies 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a trance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Laura, starting up, and laughing, with a
slight degree of constraint, which caused Amy, who was helping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to dress, to exclaim, ' Has anything happened, Laura 1 '

<p/>' What should have happened 1 '

<p/>' I can't guess, unless the fairies in the great ring on Ashen-
down came to visit you when we were gone. But seriously, dear
Laura, are you sure you are not tired 'i Is nothing the matter 1 '

<p/>' Nothing at all, thank you. I was only thinking over the
talk I had with Philip.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy never thought of entering into Philip's talks with Laura,
and was perfectly satisfied.

<p/>By this time Laura was herself again, come back to common
life, and resolved to watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) intercourse with Guy ;
since, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was convinced that all was safe at present,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had Philip's word for it that there might be danger in
continuing the pleasant freedom of their behaviour.

<p/>Nothing could be more reassuring than Guy's demeanour.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head seemed entirely full of the Thursday, and of a plan of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own for enabling Charles to go to the review. It had darted
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was going over the ground with Maurice.
It was so long since Charles had thought it possible to attempt
any amusement away from home, and former experiments had
been so unsuccessful, that it had never even occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to
think of it ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) caught at the idea with great delight and
eagerness. Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say ;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had much rather that it had not been proposed ; yet it was
very kind of Guy, and Charles was so anxious about it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
knew not how to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).



<p/>96 THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not bear to have Charles in a crowd, helpless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was ; and slie had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occa-
sion when they had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to a flower-show, where they had
lost, first Mr. Edmonstone, next the carriage, and lastly. Amy
and Charlotte -- all had been frightened, and Charles laid up
for three days from the fatigue.

<p/>Answers, however, met each objection. Charles was much
stronger ; Guy's arm would be ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; Guy would find
the carriage. Philip would be there to help, besides Maurice ;
and whenever Charles was tired, Guy would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) home at
once, without spoiling any one's pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Except your own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you ; but this would be so delightful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! ' said Charles, ' it would be as great a triumph as the
dog's that caught the hare with the clog round his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) neck -- the
dog's, I mean.''

<p/>' If you will but trust me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, turning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
all the pleading eloquence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes ; ' you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) can get
in and out of the pony-carriage quite easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' As well as walk across the room,'' said Charles.

<p/>' I would drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in it, and tell William to ride in and be at
hand to hold the pony or take it out ; and the tent is so near,
that you could get to the breakfast, unless the review had been
enough for you. I paced the distance to make sure, and it is
no further than from the garden-door to the cherry-tree.''

<p/>' That is nothing,'' said Charles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And William shall be in waiting to bring the pony the
instant you are ready, and we can go home independently of
every one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Edmonstone, `that you were to
go to the mess-dinner -- what is to become of that ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `that will be simply a bore, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) may
rejoice to be excused from going the whole hog.''

<p/>' To be sure, I had rather dine in peace at home.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was not happy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had great confi-
dence in Guy ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only real scruple was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did not
think it fair to occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entirely with attendance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) son.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) referred it to paiDa, which, as every one knew, was the same
as yielding the point, and consoled herself by the certainty that
to prevent it would be a great disappointment to both the youths.
Laura was convinced that to acliieve the adventure of Charles
at the review, was at present at least a matter of far more pro-
minence with Guy than anything relating to herself.

<p/>All but Laura and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother were wild about the weather,
especially on Wednesday, when there was an attempt at a tliun-
der storm. Nothing was studied but the sky ; and the convers-
ation consisted of prognostications, reports of rises and falls of tlie
glass, of the way weather-cocks were turning, or about to turn,
of swallows flying high or low, red sunsets, and halos round the
moon, until at last Guy, bursting into a meriy laugh, begged



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 97

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone's pardon for being such a nuisance, and made
a vow, and kept it, that be the weather what it might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would
say not another word about it that evening ; it deserved to be
neglected, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not been able to settle to anything all day.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have said for many days before ; for since the last
ball, and still more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell,
it had been one round of merriment and amusement. Scrambling
walks, tea-drinkings out of doors, dances among themselves, or
with the addition of the Harpers, were the order of the day.
Amy, Eveleen, and Guy, could hardly come into the room with-
out dancing, and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing but
waltzes, polkas, and now and then an Irish jig, for the special
benefit of Mr. Edmonstone's ears. The morning was almost as
much spent in mirth as the afternoon, for the dawdlings after
breakfast, and before luncheon, had a great tendency to spread
out and meet ; there was new music and singing to be practised,
or preparations made for evening's diversion, or councils to be
held, which Laura's absence could not break up, though it often
made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Laura was than
herself. Eveleen said the same, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) was visiting, and it was
a time to be idle ; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same
opinion with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) pupil ; for, when Guy was vexed at
not having done as much work as usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
for expecting to be able to go to balls, and spend a summer of
gaiety, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) studied as much as at Oxford.

<p/>Thursday morning was all that heart could wish, the air
cooled by the thunder, and the clouds looking as if raining
was foreign to their nature. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, their
daughters, and Lady Eveleen, were packed inside and outside the
great carriage, while Guy, carefully settling Charles in the low
phaeton, putting in all that any one recommended, from an air-
cushion to an umbrella, flourished his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whip, and drove off with
an air of exultation and delight.

<p/>Everything went off'' to admiration. No one was more amused
than Charles. The scene was so perfectly new and delightful to
one accustomed to such a monotonous life, that the very sight
of people was a novelty. Nowhere was there so much laughing
and talking as in that little carriage, and whenever Mrs. Edmon-
stone's anxious eye fell upon it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) always saw Charles sitting
upright, with a face so full of eager interest as to banish all
thought of fatigue. Happy, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enjoyed the
surprise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) acquaintance at meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enjoyed Dr.
Mayerne's laugh and congratulation ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enjoyed seeing how
foolish Philip thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), nodding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mother and sisters,
laughing at the dreadful faces Guy could not help making at
any particularly discordant note of the offensive bugle ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
capabilities rising with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spirits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did all that the others did,
walked further than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had done for years, was lifted up steps
without knowing how, sat out the whole breakfast, talked to all
the world, and well earned the being thoroughly tired, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)



<p/>98 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>certainly was when Guy put him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) into the carriage and drove
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) home, and still more so when Guy all but carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) up-
stairs, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) on the sofa in the dressing-room.

<p/>However, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother announced that it would have been so
unnatural if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not been fatigued, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should have
been more anxious, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to repose, they all, except
Mr. Edmonstone, who had stayed to dine at the mess, sat down
to dinner.

<p/>Amy came down dressed just as the carriage had been an-
nounced, and found Laura and Eveleen standing by the table,
arranging their bouquets, while Guy, in the dark, behind the
piano, was playing -- not, as usual, in such cases, the Harmonious
``Blacksmith, but a chant !

<p/>' Is mamma ready 1 ' asked Laura.

<p/>' Nearly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' but I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not obliged to go !
I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cannot bear to leave Charlie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is not going on my account,'' said Eveleen.

<p/>' No,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' we must go ; it would so frighten papa if
we did not come. Besides, there is nothing to be uneasy about
with Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' O no,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) says so, only she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is always anxious,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is too restless to go to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' We must get home as fast as we can ; if you don't mind,
Eva,'' said Laura, remembering how her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) last dance with Guy had
delayed them,

<p/>' Can I do any good to Charlie ? ' said Guy, ceasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) music,
' I don't mean to go.''

<p/>' Not go ! ' cried the girls in consternation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) is joking!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Eveleen. <div class="bookquote">``But, I declare!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>added she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>),
advancing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is not dressed ! Come, nonsense,
this is carrying it too far ; you'll make us all too late, and then
I'll set Maurice at you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is no joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, smiling,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must go. It will never do for you to stay away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said
Laura, decidedly, *

<p/>I Are you tired ? Aren't you well ? ' asked Amy.

<p/>' Quite well, thank you, but I am sure I had better not,''

<p/>Laura thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had better not seem anxious to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) left the task of persuasion to the others, and Amy went on.

<p/>' Neither Mamma nor Charlie could bear to think you stayed
because of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).''

<p/>' I don't, I assure you, Amy, I meant it before. I have been
gradually finding out that it must come to this.''

<p/>' Oh, you think it a matter of right and wrong ! But you
don't think balls wrong ? '

<p/>' Oh no ; only they won't do for such an absurd person as I
am. The last turned my head for a week, and I am much too
unsteady for this.''

<p/>' Well, if you think it a matter of duty, it can't be helped,<div class="bookquote">''
said Amy sorrowfully ; ' but I am very sorry.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 99

<p/>' Thank you/ said Guy, thinking it compassion, not regret ;
' but I shall do very well. I shall be all the happier to-morrow
for a quiet hour at my Greek, and you'll tell me all the fun.''

<p/>' You liked it so much ! ' said Amy ; ' but you have made up
your mind, and I ought not to tease you.''

<p/>' That's right, Amy ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does it on purpose to be teased,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Eveleen, ' and I never knew anybody so provoking. Mind, Sir
Guy, if you make us all too late, you shan't have the ghost of
a quadrille with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall console myself by quadrilling with Andromache,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' Come, no nonsense -- off to dress directly ! How can you have
the conscience to stand there when the carriage is at the door ? '

<p/>' I shall have great pleasure in handing you in when you are
ready.''

<p/>' Laura-- Amy ! Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) really mean it ? '

<p/>' I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does,'' said Amy.

<p/>Eveleen let herself fall on the sofa as if fainting. _ ' Oh,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said, ' take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) away ! Let me never see the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again !
I'm perfectly overcome ! All my teaching thrown away ! '

<p/>' I am sorry for you,'' said Guy, laughing.

<p/>' And how do you mean to face Maurice ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) first bugle has so distracted me that I can't

<p/>' Come, I have kept you waiting shamefully, but I have been
consoling myself by thinking you must be well entertained, as
I heard no Harmonious Blacksmith. Papa will be wondering
where we are.''

<p/>' Oh, mamma ! Guy won't go.''

<p/>' Guy ! is anything the matter ? '

<p/>' Nothing, thank you, only idleness.''

<p/>' This will never do. You really must go, Guy.''

<p/>' Indeed ! I think not. Pray don't order me, Mrs. Edmonstone.''

<p/>' What o'clock is it, Ajny ? Past ten ! Papa will be in despair !
What is to be done ? How long do you take to dress, Guy 'i '

<p/>' Not under an hour,'' said Guy, smiling.

<p/>' Nonsense ! But if there was time I should certainly send
you. Self-discipline may be carried too far, Guy. But now it
can't be helped -- I don't know how to keep papa waiting any
longer. Laura, what shall I do ? '

<p/>' Let me go to Charles,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Guy. ' Perhaps I can read
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to sleep.''

<p/>' No, for no such good reason,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' onlyHbecause I am

<p/>' Too true, I assure you,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) in.
' Good night ! You will keep the quadrille for me till I am
rational.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) handed the others in, and shut the door. Mrs. Edmon-
stone, ruffled out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) composure, exclaimed, --

<p/>' Well, this is provoking ! '

<p/>' Every one will be vexed,'' said Laura.

<p/>' It will be so stupid,'' said Amy.

<p/>' I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) up,<div class="bookquote">'' said Eveleen. ' I once had hopes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was not for papa, I really would turn back this moment
and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Edmonstone, starting forward. ' I'm
sure it will give offence. I wish I had not consented.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) can't be made to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) presence is of importance to
any living creature,'' said Laura.

<p/>' What is the reason of this whim ? ' said Eveleen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Eveleen, it is not whim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura ; `it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thinks dissipation makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) idle.''

<p/>' Then if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is idle, I wonder what the rest of the world is ! '
said Eveleen. ' I am sure we all ought to stay at home too.''

<p/>' I think so,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy. ' I know I shall feel all night as if I
was wrong to be there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am angry,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' and yet I believe it is
a great sacrifice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, mamma ; after all our looking forward to it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy.
* Oh ! yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice lost its piteous tone, `it is a real
sacrifice.''

<p/>' If he (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) was not a mere boy, I should say a lover's quarrel was
at the bottom of it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Eveleen. ' Depend upon it, Laura, it
is all your fault. You only danced once with him (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) at our ball,
and ail this week you have played for us, as if it was on purpose
to cut him (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lover</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura was glad of the darkness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother, who had a
particular dislike to jokes of this sort, went on, -- ' If it were only
ourselves I should not care, but there are so many who will fancy
it caprice, or worse.''

<p/>' The only comfort is,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' that it is Charlie's gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope they will not talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone. <div class="bookquote">``But
Charlie will never hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) tongue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) will grow excited, and
not sleep all night,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mrs. Edmonstone ! her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) trials did not end here, for when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband's inquiry for Guy, -RSB-\Ir. Edmonstone
said ofience had already been taken at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) absence from the
dinner ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not have had this happen for fifty pounds ;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ought not to have suftered it ; but it was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nonsense
about Charles, and as to not being late, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) should have waited
till midnight rather than not have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
said as much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meant, as a man in a pet is apt to
say, and nevertheless Mrs. Edmonstone had to look as amiable
and smiling as if nothing was the matter.

<p/>The least untruthful answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could frame to the inquiries



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 101

<p/>for Sir Guy Morville was, that young men were apt to be lazy
about balls, and this sufficed for good-natured Mrs. Deane, but
Maurice poured out many exclamations about his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) ill-behaviour,
and Philip contented himself with the mere fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not being
there, and made no remark.

<p/>Laura turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes anxiously on Philip. They had not
met since the important conversation on Ashen-down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
found herself looking with more pride than ever at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tall,
noble figure, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was more her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own ; but the calmness of
feeling was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eye, nor see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turn
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) without a start and tremor for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not
render herself a reason, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart beat so much that it was
at once a relief and a disappointment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was obliged to
accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) other cousin as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) first partner. Philip had already
asked Lady Eveleen, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) neither wished to appear too eager
in claiming Laura, nor to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had any dislike
to the Irish girl.

<p/>Eveleen was much pleased to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) partner, and
told herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) would be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) good behaviour. It was a
polka, and there was not much talk, which, perhaps, was all the
better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) admired the review, and the luncheon, and
spoke of Charles without any sauciness, and Philip was conde-
scending and agreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must indulge myself in abusing that stupid cousin of
yours ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>). Did you ever know a man of such wonderful
crotchets ? '

<p/>' This is a very unexpected one,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/>' It came like a thunder clap. I thought till the last moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was joking, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) likes dancing so much ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was the life of
our ba^ll, and how could any one suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would fly off at the
last moment ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems rather to enjoy doing things suddenly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I tell Laura she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has affronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),'' said Eveleen, laughing.
' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) has been always busy of late when we have wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) ;
and I assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pride has been piqued. Don't you think
that is an explanation. Captain Morville 1 '

<p/>It was Captain Morville's belief, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would not say so.

<p/>' Isn't Laura looking lovely ? ' Eveleen went on. ' I am sure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is the beauty of the night ! ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was pleased to see Captain
Morville's attention gained. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is even better dressed than
at our ball -- those Venetian pins suit the form of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head so
well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) beauty is better than almost any one's, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
has so much countenance.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/>' How proud Maurice looks of having Jier on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arm. Does
not he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ? Poor Maurice ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) is desperately in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' As is shown by his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) pining melancholy.''

<p/>Eveleen laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) clear hearty laugh. ' I see you
know what we mean by being desperately in love ! No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
added more gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad it is only that kind of



<p/>102 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>desperation. One could not think of Maurice and Laura
together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) does not know the best part of Laura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div><p/>Eveleen was highly flattered by Captain Morville conducting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) a second time round the room, instead of at once restoring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) aunt.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) secured Laura next, and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own
party, said, ' Laura, have you been overdoing it ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could keep from
blushing.

<p/>' It is the only motive that could excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) extraordinary
behaviour.''

<p/>' Surely you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is growing unsettled. It
is part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) rule of self -discipline.''

<p/>' Absurd ! -- exaggerated ! -- incredible ! This is the same story
as there was about the horse. It is either caprice or temper,
and I am convinced that some change in your manner -- nay, I
say unconscious, and am far from blaming you -- is the cause.
Why else did he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) devote himself to Charles, and leave you all on
my uncle's hands in the crowd ? '

<p/>' We could shift for ourselves much better than Charlie.'' _

<p/>' This confirms my belief that my warning was not mistimed.
I wish it could have been done without decidedly mortifying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) and rousing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) temper, because I am sorry others should
be slighted; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) takes your drawing back so much to
heart, it shows that it was time you should do so.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I thought I had!''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>' It was visible to others -- to another, I should say.''

<p/>' O, that is only Eveleen's nonsense ! The only difference I
am conscious of having made, was keeping more up-stairs, and
not trying to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to come here to-night.''

<p/>' I have no doubt it was this that turned the scale. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) only
waited for persuasion, and you acted very wisely in not flattering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) self-love.''

<p/>' Did 1 1--1 did not know it.''

<p/>' A woman's instinct is often better than reasoning, Laura ; to
do the right thing without knowing why. But come, I suppose
we must play our part in the pageant of the night.''

<p/>For that evening Laura, contrary to the evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
senses, was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own lover that Guy was falling in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; and after musing all through the dance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said,
' What do you think of the scheme that has been started for my
going to Ireland with papa ? '

<p/>' Your going to Ireland ? '

<p/>' Yes ; you know none of us, except papa, have seen grand-
mamma since Charles began to be ill, and there is some talk of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) taking me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) goes this summer.''

<p/>' I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was going, but I thought it was not to be till
later in the year -- not till after the long vacation.''

<p/>' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) intended, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) finds he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must be at home before the
end of October, and it would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) best to go in August.''



<p/>THE* HEIR -OF REDCLYFFE 103

<p/>* Then what becomes of Guy ? '

<p/>* He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stays at Holly well. It will be much better for Charles
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) there while papa is away. I thought when the
plan was first mentioned I should be sorry, except that it is
quite right to go to grandmamma ; but if it is so, about Guy,
this absence would be a good thing -- it would make a break,
and I could begin again on different terms.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wisely judged, Laura. Yes, on that account it would be
very desirable, though it will be a great loss to me, and I can
hardly hope to be so near you on your return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! yes, so I feared ! ' sighed Laura.

<p/>' But we must give up something ; and for Guy's own sake,
poor fellow, it will be better to make a break, as you say. It
will save him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pain by and by.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say papa will consult you about when his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) journey is
to be. His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) only doubt was whether it would do to leave Guy
so long alone ; and if you say it would be safe, it would decide
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see little chance of mischief. Guy has few temptations
here, and a strong sense of honour ; besides, I shall be at hand.
Taking all things into consideration, Laura, I think that, what-

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>All the remainder of the evening Philip was occupied with
attentions to the rest of the world, but Laura's eyes followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) everywhere, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) neither expected nor desired
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to bestow more time on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) underwent a strange rest-

teased her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) by hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) from watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) moving about
the room, catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tones, and guessing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was talking
of ; -- not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wanted to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eye, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not like
to blush, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) think it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) do so, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) either looked away immediately or conveyed a glance which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) understood as monitory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) kept better note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) coun-
tenance than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own partner's.

<p/>Mr. Thorndale, meanwhile, kept aloof from Lady Eveleen de
Courcy, but Captain Morville perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) eyes were
often turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), and well knew it was principle, and
not inclination, that held him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) at a distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) did indeed
once ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to dance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was engaged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) did not
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) to reserve a future dance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), but contented him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)-
self ^vith little Amy.

<p/>Amy was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best to enjoy herself, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought
it ungrateful not to receive pleasure from tliose who wished to
give it, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) it wanted the zest and animation of Lady
Kilcoran's ball. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been as idle as Guy,
or still more so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought it wrong she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should have
pleasure while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was doing penance. It was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind,
and damped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spirits, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) smiled, and talked, and
admired, and danced lightly and gaily, there was a sensation



<p/>104 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>of wearinees throughout, and no one but Eveleen was sorry
when Mrs. Edmonstone sent Maurice to see for the carriage.

<p/>Philip was one of the gentlemen who came to shawl them.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) put Laura's cloak round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) shoulders he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was able to
whisper, ' Take care ; you must be cautious -- self-command.''

<p/>Laura, though blushing and shrinking the moment before,
was braced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) words and tone to attempt all he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked up in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) meant to be an indifferent manner,
and made some observation in a careless tone -- anything rather
than let Philip think her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) silly. After what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had said, was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) not bound more than ever to exert herself to the utmost,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might not be disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
only the better for what others might have deemed a stern
coldness of manner, for it made the contrast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) real warmth
of affection more precious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mused over it, as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
companions' conversation would allow, on the road home. They
arrived, Mrs. Edmonstone peeped into Charles's room, announced
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was quietly asleep, and they all bade each other good
night, or good morning, and parted.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>Leonora. Yet often with respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) speaks of thee.

<p/>Tasso. Thou meanest with forbearance, prudent, subtle,
<div class="bookquote">``Tis that annoys me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knows to use
Language so smooth and so conditional.
That seeming praise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is actual blame.

<p/>Goethe's Tasso

<p/>When the Hollywell party met at breakfast, Charles showed
himself by no means the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) yesterday's experiment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had gone to sleep in reasonable time, lulled by some
poetry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew not what, of which Guy's voice had made very
pretty music, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was now full of talk about the amusement
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had enjoyed yesterday, Avhich seemed likely to afford food
for conversation for many a week to come.

<p/>After all the care Guy had taken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), Mrs. Edmonstone
could not find it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) heart to scold, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband having
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) vexation upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), had none left to bestow on the
real culprit. So when Guy, witli his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bright morning face, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hair hanging shining and wet round it, opened the dining-
room door, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) return from bathing in tlie river, Mr. Edmon-
stone's salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no
one cares for.

<p/>' Good morning to you, Sir Guy Morville ! I wonder wliat you
have to say for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Notliing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, smiling ; then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) place by
Mrs. Edmonstone, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you are not tired after your hard
day's work 1 '

<p/>' Not at all, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Amy, can you tell me the name of this flower ? '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 105

<p/>' Oh ! have you really found the arrow-head 1 How beautiful !
Where did you get it ? I didn't know it grew in our river.''

<p/>' There is plenty of it in that reedy place beyond the turn. I
thought it looked like something out of the common way.''

<p/>' Yes ! What a purple eye it has ! I must draw it. O, thank
you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And, Charlotte, Bustle has found you a moorhen's nest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' How delightful ! Is it where I can go and see the dear little
things 1 '

<p/>' It is rather a swamp ; but I have been putting down stepping-
stones for you, and I dare say I can jump you across. It was
that which made me so late, for which I ought to have asked
pardon,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to Mrs. Edmonstone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) look of courtesy.

<p/>Never did man look less like an offended lover, or like a morose
self-tormentor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are others later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at
Lady Eveleen's emptj^ chair.

<p/>' So you think that is all you have to ask pardon for,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr.
Edmonstone. ' I advise you to study your apologies, for you are
in pretty tolerable disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Indeed, I am very sorry,'' said Guy, with such a change of
countenance that Mr. Edmonstone's good nature could not bear
to see it.

<p/>' Oh, `tis no concern of mine ! It would be going rather the
wrong way, indeed, for you to be begging my pardon for all the
care you've been taking of Charlie ; but you had better consider
what you have to say for yourself before you show your face at
Broadstone.''

<p/>' No 1 ' said Guy, puzzled for a moment, but quickly looking
relieved, and laughing, ' What ! Broadstone in despair for want
of me?''

<p/>' And we perfectly exhausted with answering questions as to
what was become of Sir Guy.''

<p/>' Dreadful,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, now laughing heartily, in the persuasion
that it was all a joke. ' O, Lady Eveleen, good morning ; you
are come in good time to give me the story of the ball, for no
one else tells me one word about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Because you don't deserve it,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). ' I hope you have
repented by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' If you want to make me repent, you should give me a very
alluring description.''

<p/>' I sha'n't say one word about it ; I shall send you to Coventry,
as Maurice and all the regiment mean to do,'' said Eveleen,
turning away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) with a very droll arch manner of offended
dignity.

<p/>' Hear, hear ! Eveleen send any one to Coventry ! ' cried Charles.

<p/>' See what the regiment say to you.''

<p/>' Ay, when I am sent to Coventry 1 '

<p/>' O, Paddy, Paddy ! ' cried Charles, and there was a general
laugh.



<p/>106 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laura seems to be doing it in good earnest without an-
nouncing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>added Charles, when the laugh was over, ' which is
the worst sign of all.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Charles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, hastily ; then afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
owned to annoyance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) blushed, and was angry with herself for
blushing.

<p/>' Well, Laura, do tell me who your partners were ? '

<p/>Very provoking, thought Laura, that I cannot say what is
so perfectly natural and ordinary, without my foolish cheeks
tingling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) may think it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is speaking to me. So
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hurried on : ' Maurice first, then Philip,'' and then showed,
what Amy and Eveleen thought, strange oblivion of the rest of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) partners.

<p/>They proceeded into the history of the ball ; and Guy thought
no more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) offences till the following day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went to
Broadstone. Coming back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found the drawing-room full of
visitors, and was obliged to sit down and join in the conversation ;
but Mrs. Edmonstone saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was inwardly chafing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) be-
trayed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) inability to remain still, the twitchings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fore-
head and lip, and a tripping and stumbling of the words on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
tongue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wanted to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and longed to
get rid of Mrs. Brownlow ; but the door was no sooner shut on
the visitors, than Mr. Edmonstone came in, with a long letter
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) to read and comment upon. Guy took himself out of the
way of the consultation, and began to hurry up and down the
terrace, until, seeing Amabel crossing the field towards the little
gate into the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went to open it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and exclaimed -- ' Is anything the matter ?''

<p/>' Nothing to signify,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said ; ' I was only waiting for your
mother. I have got into a mess, that is all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am sorry,'' began Amy, there resting in the doubt whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might inquire further, and intending not to burthen him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) company any longer than till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) reached the house door ; but
Guy went on, -- ■

<p/>' No, you have no occasion to be sorry ; it is all my own fault ;
at least, if I was clear how it is my fault, I should not mind it
so much. It is that ball. I am sure I had not the least notion
any one would care whether I was there or not.''

<p/>' I am sure we missed you very nmch.''

<p/>' You are all so kind ; beside, I belong in a manner to you ; but
what could it signify to any one else 1 And here I find that I
have vexed every one.''

<p/>' Ah ! ' said Amy, ' mamma said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was afraid it would give
offence.''

<p/>' I ought to have attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). It was a fit of self-will in
managing myself,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, murmuring low, as if trying to find
the real indictment ; ' yet I thought it a positive duty ; wrong
every way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, turning back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had reached the door.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 107

<p/>' Why, the first person I met was Mr. Gordon ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) spoke,
like your father, half in joke, and I thought entirely so ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) said
something about all the world being in such a rage, that I was
a bold man to venture into Broadstone. Then, while I was at
Mr. Lascelles', in came Dr. Mayerne, ' We missed you at the
dinner,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) said ; ' and I hear you shirked the ball, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mayerne</b></font>)</div>I told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) how it was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lascelles</b></font>) was glad that was all, and advised
me to go and call on Colonel Deane and explain. I thought that
the best way -- indeed, I meant it before, and was walking to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
lodgings when Maurice de Courcy met me. ' Ha ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) cries out,
' Morville ! I thought at least you would have been laid up for a
month with the typhus fever ! As a friend, I advise you to go
home and catch something, for it is the only excuse that will
serve you. I am not quite sure that it will not be high treason
for me to be seen speaking to you.<div class="bookquote">'' I tried to get at the rights
of it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is such a harum-scarum fellow there was no suc-
ceeding. Next I met Thorndale, who only bowed and passed on
the other side of the street -- sign enough how it was with Philip ;
so I thought it best to go at once to the Captain, and get a
rational account of what was the matter,''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Did you 1 ' said Amy, who, though concerned and rather
alarmed, had been smiling at the humorous and expressive tones
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could not help giving effect to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) narration,

<p/>' Yes, Philip was at home, and very -- very '

<p/>' Gracious 1 ' suggested Amy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hesitated for a word.

<p/>' Just so. Only the vexatious thing was, that we never could
succeed in coming to an understanding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was ready to for-
give ; but I could not disabuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of an idea -- where he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) picked
it up I cannot guess -- that I had stayed away out of pique. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
would not even tell me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought had affronted me,
though I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) over and over again to be only straightfor-
ward ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) declared I knew.''

<p/>' How excessively provoking ! ' cried Amy. ' You cannot guess
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not the least in the world. I have not the most distant
suspicion. It was of no use to declare I was not offended with
any one ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) only looked in that way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew much
better than I did myself, and told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could make allowances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Worse than all ! How horrid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>' No, don't spoil me. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has grounds, and
my irritation was unjustifiable. Yes, I got into my old way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
cautioned me, and nearly made me mad ! I never was nearer com-
ing to a regular outbreak. Always the same ! Fool that I am.''

<p/>' Now, Guy, that is always your way ; when other people are
provoking, you abuse yourself. I am sure Philip was so, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) calm assertion of being right.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tlie more provoking, the more trial for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But you endured it. You say it was only nearhj an outbreak.
You parted friends ? I am sure of that.''

<p/>' Yes, it would have been rather too bad not to do that.''



<p/>108 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' Then why do you scold yourself, when you really had the
victory ?/

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The victory will be if the inward feeling as well as the
outward token is ever subdued.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' O, that must be in time, of course. Only let me hear how
you got on with Colonel Deane.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was very good-natured, and would have laughed it off, but
Philip went with me, and looked grand, and begged in a solemn
way that no more might be said. I could have got on better
alone ; but Philip Avas very kind, or, as you say, gracious.''

<p/>' And provoking,<div class="bookquote">'' added Amy, ' only I believe you do not like
me to say so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is more agreeable to hear you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so at this moment
than is good for me. I have no right to complain, since I gave
the offence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The offence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The absenting myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! that you did because you thought it right.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to be clear that it was right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' What do you mean 1 ' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), astonished. ' It was a great
piece of self-denial, and I only felt it wrong not to be doing the
same.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, how should such creatures as you need the same
discipline as I ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) exclaimed to herself how far from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) equal she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was -- how
weak, idle, and self-pleasing she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) felt herself to be ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could
not say so -- the words would not come ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) only drooped her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
little head, humbled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) treating her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) as better than himself.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) proceeded : --

<p/>' Something wrong I have done, and I want the clue. Was it
self-will in choosing discipline contrary to your mother's judg-
ment ? Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not know all. I thought it her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kindness
in not liking me to lose the pleasure. Besides, one must act for
oneself, and this was only my own personal amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,'' said Amy, timidly hesitating.

<p/>' Well ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), with the gentle, deferential tone that con-
trasted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hasty, vehement self -accusations. ' Well 1 ' and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) waited, though not so as to hurry or frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), but to
encourage, by showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) words had weight.

<p/>' I was thinking of one tiling,'' said Amy ; ' is it not sometimes
right to consider whether we ought to disappoint people who
want us to be pleased ? '

<p/>' There it is, I believe,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, stopping and considering,
then going on with a better satisfied air, ' that is a real rule.
Not to be so bent on myself as to sacrifice other people's feelings
to what seems best for me. But I don't see whose pleasure I
interfered with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy could have answered, ' Mine ; ' but the maidenly feeling
checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We all thought you would like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' And I had no right to sacrifice your pleasure ! I see, I see.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 109

<p/>The pleasure of giving pleasure to others is so much the best
there is on earth, that one ought to be passive rather tlian
interfere with it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, `just as I liave seen Mary Ross let herself
be swung till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) was giddy, rather than disappoint Charlotte
and Helen, who thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) liked it.''

<p/>' If one could get to look at everything with as much indif-
ference as the swinging ! But it is all selfishness. It is as easy
to be selfish for one's own good as for one's own pleasure ; and
I dare say, the first is as bad as the other.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking of something else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``I should
think it more like the holly tree in Southey. Don't you know
it ? The young leaves are sharp and prickly, because they have
so much to defend themselves from, but as the tree grows older,
it leaves off the spears, after it has won the victory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Very kind of you, and very pretty. Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>), smiling ;
' but, in the meantime, it is surely wrong to be more prickly than
is unavoidable, and there is the perplexity. Selfish ! selfish !
selfish ! Oneself the first object. That is the root.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Guy, if it is not impertinent to ask, I do wish you would tell
me one thing. Why did you think it wrong to go to that
ball 1 ' said Amy, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I thought it wrong to go to that indi-
vidual ball,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy ; ' but my notion was, that altogether I
was getting into a rattling idle way, never doing my proper
quantity of work, or doing it properly, and talking a lot of
nonsense sometimes. I thought, last Sunday, it was time to
make a short turn somewhere and bring myself up. I could
not, or did not get out of the pleasant talks as Laura does, so
I thought giving up this ball would punish me at once, and
set me on a new tack of behaving like a reasonable creature.''

<p/>' Don't call yourself too many names, or you won't be civil
to us. We all, except Laura, have been quite as bad.''

<p/>' Yes ; but you had not so much to do.''

<p/>' We ought,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' but I meant to be reasonable when
Eveleen is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Perhaps I ought to have waited till then, but I don't know.
Lady Eveleen is so amusing that it leads to farther dawdling,
and it would not do to wait to resist the temptation till it is
out of the way.''

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) spoke, they saw Mrs. Edmonstone coming out, and
went to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). Guy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) trouble, detailing it more
calmly than before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had found out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mistake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) agreed
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that this had been in forgetting that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attending the
ball did not concern only himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) then returned to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not see what difference it made, except to their
own immediate circle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it was not you, Guy, who made that speech, I should
call it fishing for a compliment. You forget that rank and
station make people sought after.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>no THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* I suppose there is something in that,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, thoughtfully ^
`at any rate, it is no bad thing to think so, it is so^ humiliating.
' That is not the way most people would take it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>' No 'i Does not it prevent one from taking any attention as
paid to one's real self? The real flattering thing would be to
be made as much of as Philip is, for one's own merits, and not
for the handle to one's name.''
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished to gather the whole conversation
into one resolve, ' the point is to consider whether abstaining
from innocent things that may be dangerous to oneself mortifies
other people. If so, the vexing them is a certain wrong, whereas
the mischief of taking the pleasure is only a possible contingency.
But then one must take it out of oneself some other way, or it
becomes an excuse for self-indulgence.''

<p/>' Hardly with you,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.
' Because I had rather go at it at once, and forget all about
other people. You must teach me consideration, Mrs. Edmon-
stone, and in the meantime will you tell me what you think i
had better do about this scrape V , ,^ , i i

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone. ``You have begged
every one's pardon, and it had better be forgotten as fast as
possible. They have made more fuss already than it is worth.
Don't torment yourself about it any more ; for, if you have made
a mistake, it is on the right side ; and on the first opportunity,
I'll go and call on Mrs. Deane, and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) is very implacable.
The dressing-bell rang, and Amy ran up-stairs, stopping at
Laura's door, to ask how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) prospered in the drive she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
been taking with Charles and Eveleen.

<p/>Amy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) of Guy's trouble, and oh ! awkward question,
inquired if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could guess what it could be that Philip imagined
that Guy had been offended at. t ^ ^ •

<p/>' Can't he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guess 1 ' said poor Laura, to gain time, and brushing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hair over her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face.

<p/>' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has no idea, though Philip protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew,
and would not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Philip must have been most tiresome.
' What 1 Has Guy been complaining V ^

<p/>``No, only angry with himself for being vexed. I cant
think how PhiUp can go on so 1 ' .

<p/>' Hush ! hush, Amy, you know nothing about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has

<p/>reasons ' . , , i .

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, indignantly ; ' but what right has he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to
go on mistrusting ? If people are to be judged by their deeds,
no one is so good as Guy, and it is too bad to reckon up against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ancestors have done. It is wolf and lamb, indeed.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does not ! ' cried Laura. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never is unjust ! How can

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) impute motives, and not straightforwardly

<p/>' It is impossible in this case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy</b></font>)</div>said Laura.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 111

<p/>* Do you know what it is ? '

<p/>* Yes,'' said Laura, perfectly truthful, and feeling herself in a
dreadful predicament.

<p/>' And you can't tell me 1 '

<p/>* I don't think I can.''
<div class="bookquote">``NorGuyr

<p/>* Not for worlds,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Laura, in horror.
' Can't you get Philip to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Oh no, no ! I can't explain it, Amy : and all that can be
done is to let it die away as fast as possible. It is only the rout
about it that is of consequence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, `but I must dress,'' and away she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
ran, much puzzled, but with no desire to look into Philip's secrets.

<p/>Laura rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hand, sighed, and wondered why
it was so hard to answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) almost wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had said Philip
had been advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to discourage any attachment on Guy's
part : but then Amy might have laughed, and asked why. No !
no ! Philip's confidence was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) keeping, and, cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) what
it might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would be faithful to the trust.

<p/>There was now a change. The evenings were merry, but the
mornings were occupied. Guy went off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used
to do last winter ; Laura commenced some complicated perspec-
tive, or read a German book with a great deal of dictionary ;
Amy had a book of history, and practised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) music diligently ;
even Charles read more to himself, and resumed the study with
Guy and Amy ; Lady Eveleen joined in every one's pursuits,
enjoyed them, and lamented to Laura that it was impossible to
be rational at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own home.

<p/>Laura tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that there was no need that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
should be on the level of the society round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and it ended in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) spending an hour in diligent study every morning, promising
to continue it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went home, while Laura made such sen-
sible comments that Eveleen admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) more than ever ; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), knowing that some were second-hand from Philip, others
arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) suggestions, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) all the homage paid to
herself, as a tribute to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) who reigned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) whole being.

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was far from happy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) reserve towards Guy
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feel stiff and guarded ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had a craving for Philip's
presence, with a dread of showing it, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) uncomfort-
able. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not been at Hollywell since the ball,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was going to Ireland in a fortnight,
and was not likely to return till his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regiment had left Broadstone.

<p/>An interval passed long enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) not to be alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) absenting himself before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at length made his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
appearance, just before luncheon, so as to miss the unconstrained
morning hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) used so much to enjoy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found Guy,
Charles, and Amy, deep in Butler's Analogy.

<p/>' Are you making poor little Amy read that ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>' Bravo ! ' cried Charles ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is so disappointed that it is not
Pickwick that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) does not know what else to say.''

never done before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) complacency was less secure, so that
there was more need for self-assertion.
' Where are the rest 1 ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked.

<p/>' Laura and Eveleen are making a dictation lesson agreeable to
Charlotte,'' said Amy ; ' I found Eva making mistakes on purpose.
' How much longer does she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) stay ? ' ^ , i ,

<p/>' Till Tuesday. Lord Kilcoran is coming to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
Charlotte entered, and immediately ran up-stairs to announce
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cousin's arrival. Laura was glad of this previous notice, and
hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) blush and tremor were not observed. It was a struggle,
through luncheon time, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) colour and confusion withm
bounds ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) succeeded better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did, and
Philip gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) as much help as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could, by not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).
Seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dreaded nothing so much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) exciting suspicion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was at once braced and alarmed. i j i • ^

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father was very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tor
making himself a stranger, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sisters counted up the days
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence.

<p/>' There was the time, to be sure, when we met you on Ashen-
down, but that was a regular cheat. Laura had you all to herself.
Laura bent down to feed Bustle, and Philip felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) colour

<p/>deepening. , , . , i , i.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone went on to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to come and stay at
Hollywell for a week, vowing he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would take no refusal. A
week was out of the question,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could come
for two nights.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>Amabel hinted that there was to be a dinner-
party on Thursday, thinking it fair to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) warning of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disliked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) immediately chose that very day. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
disconcerted all expectations, when it was time to go out. Mrs.
Edmonstone and Charles were going to drive, the young ladies
and Guy to walk, but Philip disposed himself to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
uncle in a survey of the wheat.

<p/>Laura perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not risk taking another walk
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) when they might be observed. It showed imphcit
trust to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rival ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was sorry to find that
caution must put an end to the freedom of their intercourse, and
would have stayed at home, but that Eveleen was so wild and
unguarded that Mrs. Edmonstone did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to be with-
out Laura as a check on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), especially when Guy was of the party

<p/>There was some comfort in that warm pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hand

<p/>time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stood at the window watching them till they were
out of sight, then moved towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bonnet
on, was writing an invitation for Thursday, to Mr. Thorndale.

<p/>' I was thinking,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>), in a low voice, ' if it would not be
as well, if you liked, to ask Thorndale here for those two days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' If you think so,'' returned Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)
more inquiringly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) could well bear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) enjoys being here, and I owe them all so
much kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Certainly ; I will speak to your uncle,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), going in
search of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) presently returned, saying they should be
very glad to see Mr. Thorndale, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) at the same time,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) kind tones of interest, after an old servant for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
had been spending much thought and pains. The kindness cut
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to the heart, for it evidently arose from a perception that
he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was ill at ease, and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) conscience smote him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) answered
shortly, and was glad when the carriage came ; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) lifted Charles
into it, and stood with folded arms as they drove away.

<p/>' The air is stormy,'' said Charles, looking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>' You thought so, too ? ' said Mrs. Edmonstone, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I have wondered for some time past.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very decided to-day -- that long absence -- and there
was no provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to be sententious. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) young
man might be only to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in due subjection ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)

the young ladies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is not like himself,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, in a leading tone.

<p/>' Either the sweet youth is in love, or in the course of some
strange transformation.''

<p/>' In love ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) exclaimed. ' Have you any reason for thinking so? '

<p/>' Only as a solution of phenomena ; but you look as if I had
hit on the truth.''

<p/>' I hope it is no such thing ; yet -- '

<p/>' Yet 1 ' repeated Charles, seriously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has discovered the danger.''

odd if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own work. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must
know how preposterous that would be.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that would prevent it?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, smiling.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is just the man to plume himself on making his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) judgment

<p/>' Hm ! I don't think it unlikely,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles. ' It agrees
with what happened the evening of the Kilcoran ball, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was ready to eat me up for saying something he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fancied was
a hint of a liking of Guy's for Laura. It was a wild mistake,
for something I said about Petrarch, forgetting that Petrarch
suggested Laura ; but it put him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) out to a degree, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made
all manner of denunciations on the horror of Guy's falling in
love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Now, as far as I see, Guy is much more in love
with you, or with Deloraine, and the idea argues far more that
the Captain himself is touched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Depend upon it, Charlie, it was this that led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) detecting
the true state of the case. Ever since that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has kept away.
It is noble ! '

<p/>' And what do you think about Laura ? '

<p/>* Poor child ! I doubt if it was well to allow so much intimacy ;
yet I don't see how it could have been helped.''

<p/>' So you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is in for it ? I hope not ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has not
been herself of late.''

<p/>' I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) misses what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has been used to from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), and
thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) estranged, but I trust it goes no further. I see she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
is out of siDirits ; I wish I could help her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), dear girl, but the worst
of all would be to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) guess the real name and meaning of all
this, so I can't venture to say a word.''

<p/>*She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is very innocent of novels,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, `and that is
well. It would be an unlucky business to have our poor beauty
either sitting ' like Patience on a monument,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>' or cockit up on
a baggage-waggon.<div class="bookquote">'' But that will never be. Philip is not the
man to have a wife in barracks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
books, in morocco, or not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would never involve her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in discomforts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may be en-
tirely trusted, and as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) goes on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has begun, there
is no harm done ; Laura will cheer up, will only consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin and friend, and never know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has felt more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).''

<p/>' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) going to Ireland is very fortunate.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has made me still more glad that the plan should take
place at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' And you say <div class="bookquote">'' nothing to nobody ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>1 '

<p/>' Of course not. We must not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) guess we have observed
anything ; there is no need to make your father uncomfortable,
and such things need not dawn on Amy's imagination.''

<p/>It may be wondered at that Mrs. Edmonstone should confide
such a subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) son, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew that in a case really
affecting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sister, and thus introduced, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) silence was secure.
In fact, confidence was the only way to prevent the shrewd,
unscrupulous raillery which Avould have caused great distress,
and perhaps led to the very disclosure to be deprecated. Of
late, too, tliere had been such a decrease of petulance in Charles,
as justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) in trusting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; and lastly, it must be observed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was one of those open-hearted people who cannot make
a discovery nor endure an anxiety without imparting it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 115

<p/>tact, indeed, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to make a prudent choice of confidants, and
in this case her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) son was Inr far the best, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had spoken
without premeditation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nature would never have allowed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to act as her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter was doing ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would have been with-
out the strength to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) feelings, especially when deprived
of the safety-valve of free intercourse with their object.

<p/>The visit took place as arranged, and very uncomfortable it
was to all who looked deeper than the surface. In the first
place, Philip found there the last person he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend to
meet -- Lady Eveleen, who had been persuaded to stay for the
dinner-party ; but Mr. Thorndale was, as Charles would have
said, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good behaviour, and, ashamed of the fascination her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
manners exercised over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), was resolved to resist it, answered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) gay remarks with brief sentences and stiff'' smiles, and con-
sorted chiefly with the gentlemen.

<p/>Laura was grave and silent, trying to appear unconscious,
and only succeeding in being visibly constrained. Philip was
anxious and stern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) attempts to appear unconcerned, and
even Guy was not quite as bright and free as usual, being
puzzled as to how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was forgiven about the ball.

<p/>Amabel could not think what had come to every one, and
tried in vain to make them sociable. In the evening they had
recourse to a game, said to be for Charlotte's amusement, but in
reality to obviate some of the stiffness and constraint ; yet even
this led to awkward situations. Each person was to set down
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) favourite character in history and fiction, flower,
virtue, and time at which to have lived, and these were all to
be appropriated to the writers. The first read was --

<p/>' Lily of the valley -- truth -- Joan of Arc -- Padre Cristoforo --
the present time.''

<p/>' Amy ! ' exclaimed Guy.

<p/>' I see you are right,'' said Charles ; ' but tell me your grounds ? '

<p/>' Padre Christoforo,'' was the answer.

<p/>' Fancy little Amy choosing Joan of Arc,<div class="bookquote">'' said Eveleen, ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
who is afraid of a tolerable sized grasshopper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Joan</b></font>)</div><p/>' I should like to have been Joan's sister, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) tell
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) visions,'' said Amy.

<p/>' You would have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to believe them,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ! ' cried Guy. <div class="bookquote">``Surely you take the high view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, `that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is a much injured person, as
much by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) friends as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) enemies ; but I don't pretend to enter
either enthusiastically or philosophically into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) character.''

<p/>What was it that made Guy's brow contract, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began to strip
the feather of a pen, till, recollecting himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) threw it from
liim with a dash, betraying some irritation, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands.

<p/>' Lavender,'' read Charlotte.

<p/>' What should make any one choose that ? ' cried Eveleen.

<p/>' I know ! ' said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking up. ' I shall never
forget the tufts of lavender round the kitchen garden. at
Stylehurst.''

colour deepening as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) work.

his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) countenance as Eveleen laughed, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was much
flattered by those becoming blushes. But here Charles broke
in, -- ' Come, make haste, Charlotte, don't be all night about it ; '
and as Charlotte paused, as if to make some dangerous remark,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) caught the paper, and read the next himself. Nothing so
startled Philip as this desire to cover their confusion. Laura
was only sensible of the relief of having attention drawn from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) by the laugh that followed.

<p/>``A shamrock -- Captain Rock -- the tailor that was ``blue

Malachy with the collar of gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eva</b></font>)</div><p/>' Eva ! ' cried Charlotte.

<p/>' Nonsense,<div class="bookquote">'' said Eveleen ; ' I am glad I know your tastes,
Charles. They do you honour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' More than yours do, if these are yours,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, reading
them contemptuously ; ' Rose -- generosity -- Charles Edward --
Catherine Seyton -- the civil wars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' You had better not have disowned Charlie's, Lady Eveleen,''
said Guy.

<p/>' Nay, do you think I would put up with such a set as these ? '
retorted Charles ; ' I am not fallen so low as the essence of
young ladyism.''

<p/>' What can you find to say against them 1 ' said Eveleen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``No one ever can find anything to
say for or against young ladies' tastes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to be rather in the case of the tailor yourself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, `ready to do battle, if you could but get any
opposition.''

<p/>' Only tell me,'' said Amy, ' how you could wish to live in the
civil wars ? '

<p/>' O, because they would be so entertaining.''

<p/>' There's Paddy, genuine Paddy at last ! ' exclaimed Charles.
' Depend upon it, the conventional young lady won't do, Eva.''

<p/>After much more discussion, and one or two more papers,
came Guy's -- the last. <div class="bookquote">``Heather -- Truth -- King Charles -- Sir
Galahad -- the present time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Sir how much ? ' exclaimed Charles.

<p/>' Don't you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) 1 ' said Guy. ' Sir Galahad -- the Knight
of the Siege Perilous -- who won the Saint Greal.''

<p/>' What language is that ? ' said Charles.

<p/>' Wliat ! Don^ you know the Morte d Arthur ? I thought'
every one did ! Don't you, Philip ! '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 117

<p/>' I once looked into it. It is very curious, in classical English ;
but it is a book no one could read through.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>cried Guy, indignantly; then, `but you only looked
into it. If you had lived with its two fat volumes, you could
not help delighting in it. It was my boating-book for at least
three summers.''

<p/>' That accounts for it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' a book so studied in boy-
hood acquires a charm apart from its actual merits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But it has actual merits. The depth, the mystery, the alle-
gory -- the beautiful characters of some of the knights.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look through the medium of your imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said
Philip ; ' but you must pardon others for seeing a great same-
ness of character and adventure, and for disapproving of the
strange mixture of religion and romance.''

<p/>' You've never read it,'' said Guy, striving to speak patiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A cursory view is sufficient to show whether a book will
repay the time spent in reading it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' A ursory view enable one to judge better than making it
your study ? Eh, Philip 1 ' said Charles.

<p/>' It is no paradox. The actual merits are better seen by an
unprejudiced stranger than by an old friend who lends them
graces of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own devising.''

<p/>Charles laughed : Guy pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) chair, and went to
look out at the window. Perhaps Philip enjoyed thus chafing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) temper ; for after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had said to Laura, it was satisfactory
to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opinion justified, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might not feel himself
unfair. It relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uneasiness lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) understanding with
Laura should be observed. It had been in great peril that
evening, for as the girls went up to bed, Eveleen gaily said,
' Why, Laura, have you quarrelled with Captain Morville 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say such things, Eva? Good night.''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>And
Laura escaped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own room.

<p/>' What's the meaning of it. Amy 1 ' pursued Eveleen.

<p/>' Only a stranger makes us more formal,'' said Amy.

<p/>' What an innocent you are ! It is of no use to talk to you ! '
said Eveleen, running away.

<p/>' No ; but Eva,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), ' don't go off with a
wrong fancy. Charles has teased Laura so much about Philip,
that of course it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) shy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) before strangers ; and it
would never have done to laugh about their choosing the same
things when Mr. Thorndale was there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eva</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must be satisfied, I suppose. I know that is what you
think, for you could not say any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' But what do you think 1 ' said Amy, puzzled.
<div class="bookquote">``I won't tell you, little innocence -- it would only shock you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing you really thought about Laura could shock me/
said Amy ; ' I don't mean what you might say in play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, then, shall you think me in play or earnest when I say
that I think Laura likes Philip very much ? '

<p/>' In play,'' said Amy ; ' for you know that if we had not got



<p/>118 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>our own Charlie to show us what a brother is, we should think
of Philip as just the same as a brother.''

<p/>' A brother ! You are pretending to be more simple than you
really are, Amy ! Don't you know what I mean ? '

<p/>' O,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cheeks lighting up, ' that must be only
play, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has never asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>* Ah, but suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was in the state just ready to be asked 1 '

<p/>*No, that could never be, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could never ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not, little Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because we are cousins, and everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, confused.
' Don't talk any more about it, Eva ; for though I know it is all
play, I don't like it, and mamma would not wish me to talk of
such things. And don't you laugh about it, dear Eva, pray ; for
it only makes every one uncomfortable. Pray ! '

<p/>Amy had a very persuasive way of saying ' pray,'' and Eveleen
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) must yield to it. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) respected Laura and
Captain Morville too much to resolve to laugh at them, what-
ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) might do when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) fear of the Captain made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saucy.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone thought it best on all accounts to sit in the
drawing-room the next morning ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) need not have taken
so much pains to chaperon her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) young ladies, for the gentlemen
did not come near them.

<p/>Laura was more at ease in manner, though very far from
happy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was restlessly eager for a talk with Philip ; while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was resolved not to seek a private interview, sure that it
would excite suspicion, and willing to lose the consciousness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) underhand proceedings.

<p/>This was the day of the dinner-party, and Laura's heart leaped
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) calculated that it must fall to Philip's lot to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
in to dinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was not mistaken, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did give her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arm ;
and they found themselves most favourably placed, for Philip's
other neighbour was Mrs. Brownlow, talking at a great rate to
Mr. de Courcy, and on Laura's side was the rather deaf Mr.
Hayley, who had quite enough to do to talk to Miss Brownlow.
Charles was not at table, and not one suspicious eye could rest
on them ; yet it was not till the second course was in progress
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said anything which the whole world might not have
heard. Something had passed about Canterbury, and its dis-
tance from Hollywell.

<p/>' I can be here often,'' said Philip.

<p/>' I am glad.''

<p/>' If you can only be guarded, -- and I think you are becoming so.*

<p/>' Is this a time to speak of ? Oh, don't ! '

<p/>' It is the only time. No one is attending, and I have some-
thing to say to you.''

<p/>Overpowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dire confusion, in obedience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
looked at the epergne, and listened.

<p/>' You have acted prudently. You have checked ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)

<p/>indicated Guy -- ' without producing more than moderate annoy-
ance. You have only to guard your self-possession.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE ll§

<p/>' It is very foolish/ she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) murmured.

<p/>' Ordinary women say so, and rest contented with the folly.
You can do better things.''

<p/>There was a thrill of joy at finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) conversing wdth her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ' own ; ' it overcame lier embarrassment and alarm, and
wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would not choose such a time for speaking.

<p/>' How shall 1 1 ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>' Employ yourself. Employ and strengthen your mind ! '

<p/>* How shall I, and without you ? '

<p/>' Find something to prevent you from dwelling on the future.
That drawing is dreamy work, employing the fingers and leaving
the mind free.''

<p/>' I have been trying to read, but I cannot fix my mind.''

<p/>' Suppose you take what will demand attention. Mathematics,
algebra. I will send you my first book of algebra, and it will
help you to work down many useless dreams and anxieties.''

<p/>' Thank you ; pray do ; I shall be very glad of it.''

<p/>' You will find it give a power and stability to your mind, and
no longer have to complain of frivolous occupation.''

<p/>' I don't feel frivolous now,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, sadly ; ' I don't know
why it is that everything is so altered, I am really happier, but
my light heart is gone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' You have but now learnt the full powers of your soul, Laura ;
you have left the world of childhood, with the gay feelings
which have no depth.''

<p/>' I have what is better,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) whispered.

<p/>' You have, indeed. But those feelings must be regulated, and
strengthening the intellect strengthens the governing power.''

<p/>Philip, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sense, was mystifying himself, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was departing from right, the only true `good sense.'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
right judgment in all things was becoming obscured, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) talked
metaphysical jargon instead of plain practical truth, and thought
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was teaching Laura to strengthen her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) powers of mind, in-
stead of giving way to dreams, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was only leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
to stifle meditation, and thus securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) complete submission
to himself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was happier after this conversation, and better able to pay
attention to the guests, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feel guilty when obliged to
play and sing in the evening -- for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must own that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could do no otherwise.

<p/>Lady Eveleen gave, however, its brilliancy to the party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
had something wonderfully winning and fascinating about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>),
and Philip owned to himself that it took no small resolution on
the part of Mr. Thorndale to keep so steadily aloof from the
party in the bay window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) was reigning like a queen,
and inspiring gaiety like a fairy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) made Guy sing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) ;
it was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had ever sung, except among themselves,
as Mrs. Edmonstone had never known whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would like to
be asked ; but Eveleen refused to sing some of the Irish melodies
unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would join her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), and without making any difficulty he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)



<p/>120 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>did so. Mrs. Brownlow professed to be electrified, and Eveleen
declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) sung like a peacock, told Mrs.
Brownlow that the thing to hear was Sir Guy singing glees with
Laura and Amy. Of course, they were obliged to sing. Mrs.
Brownlow was delighted ; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had considerable knowledge
of music, they all grew eager ; and Philip thought it very foolish
of Guy to allow so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) talent and enthusiasm to display
themselves.

<p/>When all the people were gone, and the home party had wished
each other good-night, Philip lingered in the drawing-room to
finish a letter. Guy, after helping Charles up-stairs, came down
a few moments after, to fetch something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had forgotten.
Philip looked up, -- ' You contributed greatly to the entertain-
ment this evening,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said.

<p/>Guy coloured, not quite sure that this was not said sarcas-
tically, and provoked with himself for being vexed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think one devoid of the sixth sense has no right to
speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip.

<p/>' I can't expect all to think it, as I do, one of the best things
in this world or out of it,'' said Guy, speaking quickly.

<p/>' I know it is so felt by those who understand its secrets,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Philip, ' I would not depreciate it ; so you may hear me patient-
ly, Guy. I only meant to warn you, that it is often the means
of bringing persons into undesirable intimacies, from which they
cannot disentangle themselves as easily as they enter them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>A flush crossed Guy's cheek, but it passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) simply said
-- ' I suppose it may. Good-night.''

<p/>Philip looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and pondered on what it was that
had annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) -- manner, words, or advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ascribed it to
Guy's unwillingness to be advised, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had observed that
liis counsel was apt to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), though his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good sense often
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to follow it. In the present case, Philip thought Mrs.
Brownlow and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) society by no means desirable for a youth
like Guy ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite right

<p/>Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend went the next morning ; and in the
afternoon Laura received the book of algebra -- a very original
first gift from a lover. It came openly, with a full understanding
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was to use it by his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) recommendation ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother and
brother both thought they understood the motive, which one
thought very wise, and tlie other very characteristic.

<p/>Lord Kilcoran and Lady Eveleen also departed. Eveleen very
sorry to go, though a little comforted by the prospect of seeing
Laura so soon in Ireland, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would set her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) going in all
kinds of ' rationalities -- reading, and school teaching, and every-
thing else.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, when all were out of hearing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
mother ; ' and I shrewdly suspect the comfort would be still
greater if it was Sir Guy Morville who was coming.''

<p/>' It would be no bad thing,<div class="bookquote">'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) mother ; ' Eveleen is a
nice creature, with great capabilities.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 121

<p/>' Capabilities ! but will they ever come to anything 1 '

<p/>' In a few years/ said Mrs. Edmonstone ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is a mere
boy at present, so there is plenty of tim.e for both to develop
themselves.''

<p/>' Most true, madame mere ; but it remains to be proved whether
the liking for Sir Guy, which has taken hold of my lady Eveleen,
is strong enough to withstand all the coquetting with young
Irishmen, and all the idling at Kilcoran.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has something better to be relied on than the
liking for Sir Guy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You may well do so ; for I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has no notion of throw-
ing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) allegiance to you -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first and only love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liked
very well to make fun with Eva ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) rather as
a siren, who drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) off from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Latin and Greek.''

<p/>' Yes ; I am ashamed of myself for such a fit of match-making !
Forget it, Charlie, as fast as you can.''



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>This warld's wealth, when I think o' t,

<p/>Its pride, and a' the lave o' t.
Fie, fie on silly coward man,

<p/>That lie should be the slave o' t. -- Burns

<p/>In another week Mr. Edmonstone and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eldest daughter were
to depart on their Irish journey. Laura, besides the natural
pain in leaving home, was sorry to be no longer near Philip, espe-
cially as it was not likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be still at Broadstone
on their return ; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was so restless and dissatisfied, that
any change was welcome, and the fear of betraying herself
almost took away the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) presence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) met them at the railway station at Broadstone, where Mr.
Edmonstone, finding himself much too early, recollected some-
thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had forgotten in the town, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter to walk
up and down the platform under Philip's charge. They felt it a
precious interval, but both were out of spirits, and could hardly
profit by it.

<p/>' You will be gone long before we come back,'' said Laura.

<p/>' In a fortnight or three weeks, probably.''

<p/>' But you will still be able to come to Holly well now and then 1 '

<p/>' I hope so. It is all the pleasure I can look for. We shall
never see such a summer again.''

<p/>' Oh, it has been a memorable one ! '

<p/>' Memorable ! Yes. It has given me an assurance that com-
pensates for all I have lost ; yet it has made me feel, more than
ever before, how poverty withers a man's hopes.''

<p/>' O Philip, I always thouglit your poverty a great, noble thing ! '

<p/>' You thought like a generous-tempered girl, who has known
nothing of its effects.''



<p/>122 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFli

<p/>* And do you know that Guy says, the thing to be proud of, is
of holding the place you do, without the aid of rank or riches.''

<p/>* I would not have it otherwise -- I would not for worlds that
my father had acted otherwise/ said Philip. ' You understand
that, Laura.''

<p/>' Of course I do.''

<p/>' But when you speak -- when Guy speaks of my holding the
place I do, you little know what it is to feel that powers of use-
fulness are wasted -- to know I have the means of working my
way to honour and distinction, such as you would rejoice in,
Laura, to have it all within, yet feel it thrown away. Locksley
Hall, again -- <div class="bookquote">'' every door is barred with gold, and opens but to
golden keys.''  (<font color='red'><b>Locksley Hall</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>' I wish there was anything to be done,'' said Laura.

<p/>' It is my profession that is the bar to everything. I have
sold the best years of my life, and for what ? To see my sister
degrade herself by that marriage.''

<p/>' That is the real grief,'' said Laura.

<p/>* But for that, I should never have cast a look back on what I
relinquished. However, why do I talk of these things, these vain
regrets 1 They only occurred because my welfare does not con-
cern myself alone -- and here's your father.''

<p/>' Mr. Edmonstone returned, out of breath, in too much bustle to
remark his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter's blushes. Even when the train was moving
off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) still had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) head out at the window, calling to Philip that
they should expect a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as soon as ever they returned.

<p/>Such cordiality gave Philip a pang ; and in bitterness of spirit
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) walked back to the barracks. On the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) met Mrs. Deane,
who wanted to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) about inviting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin. Sir Guy, to
a dinner-party she (<font color='blue'><b>Deane</b></font>) intended to give next week. ' ' Such an agree-
able, sensible youth, and we feel we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) some attention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
took so much pains to make apologies about the ball.''

<p/>' I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will be very happy to come.''

<p/>' We will write at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is a very fine young man, without
a shade of vanity or nonsense.''

<p/>' Yes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has very pleasant, unaffected manners.''

<p/>* I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will do credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) estate. It is a very hand-
some fortune, is it not 1 '

<p/>' It is a very large property.''

<p/>' I am glad of it ; I have no doubt we shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one of the
first men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) time.''

<p/>These words brought into contrast in Philip's mind the differ-
ence between Guy's position and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own. The mere possession
of Avealth was winning for Guy, at an age when his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) merits could
only be negative, that estimation which his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own tried character
had scarcely achieved, placing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not merely on a level with
himself, but in a situation where happiness and influence came
unbidden. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own talents, attainments, and equal, if not supe-
rior claims, to gentle blood, could not procure him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) what seemed
to lie at Guy's feet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own ability and Laura's heart alone



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 123

<p/>were what wealth could not affect ; yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought how
the want of it wasted the one, and injured the hopes of tlie other,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) recurred to certain visions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister Margaret's, in days
gone by, of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was to do as 8ir Philip, lord of lledclyffe.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was speculating on what would have happened had Guy died
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sickly infancy, when, suddenly recollecting himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind to other objects.

<p/>Guy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane's invitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must go to make up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rudeness about the
ball ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grumbled enough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh
at liim for being so stupid as to want to stay lium-drum in the
chimney corner. No doubt it was very pleasant there. There
was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a remnant of a large
party, when each member of it feels bound to prevent the rest
from being dull. Guy devoted himself to Charles more than ever,
and in the fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might miss the late variety of amusement,
exerted even more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) powers of entertainment than Lady
Eveleen had called fortli.

<p/>There were grave readings in the mornings, and long walks in
the afternoons, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dragged Charles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) chair, into many
a place he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never expected to see again, and enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to
accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother and sisters in many a delightful expedi-
tion. In the evening there was music, or light reading, espe-
cially poetry, as this was encouraged by Mrs. Edmonstone, in the
idea that it was better that so excitable and enthusiastic a person
as Guy should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) objects of admiration tested by Charles's
love of ridicule.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st
of September, one which lie greatly relished. Indeed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) o\vn deserted manors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was heard to exclaim, in
commiseration for the neglect, ' Poor partridges ! ' The Holly-
well shooting was certainly not like that at PtedclyfFe, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could hardly walk out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own grounds, whereas here he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
to bear in mind so many boundaries, that Philip was expecting
to have to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) out of some direful scrape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had generally
walked over the whole extent, and assured himself that the birds
were very wild, and Bustle the best of dogs, before breakfast, so
as to be ready for all the occupations of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
scarcely be grateful when the neighbours, thinking it must be
very dull for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to be left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
crippled son, used to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to shoot or dine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) always
lamented at first, and ended by enjoying himself.

<p/>One night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came home, in such a state of eagerness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
must needs tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good news ; and, finding no one in the draw-
ing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ran up-stairs, opened Charles's door, and exclaimed
-- ' There's to be a concert at Broadstone ! ' Then perceiving
that Charles was fast asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) retreated noiselessly, reserving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rejoicings till morning, w^hen it appeared that Charles had
heard, but had woven the announcement into a dream.

<p/>This concert filled Guy's head. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only grief was that it wa.s



<p/>124 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>to be in the evening, so that Charles could not go to it ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wonder was not repressed at finding that Philip did not mean to
favour it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) presence, since Guy would suffice for squire to
Mrs. Edmonstone and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>In fact, Philip was somewhat annoyed by the perpetual con-
versation about the concert, and on the day on which it Avas to
take place resolved on making a long expedition to visit the ruins
of an old abbey, far out of all reports of it. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was setting
out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was greeted, in a very loud voice, by Mr. Gordon.

<p/>' Hollo, Morville ! how are you ? So you have great doings
to-night, I hear ! ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had only just forced himself from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>),
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was again accosted, this time in a hasty, embarrassed
manner, --

<p/>' I beg your pardon, sir, but the ties of relationship '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) drew himself up as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was on parade, faced round, and
replied with an emphatic ' Sir ! ' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) beheld a thin, foreign-
looking man, in a somewhat flashy style of dress, who, bowing
low, repeated breathlessly, --

<p/>' I beg your i3ardon -- Sir Guy Morville, I believe ? '

<p/>' Captain Morville, sir.''

<p/>' I beg your pardon -- I mistook. A thousand pardons,'' and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) retreated ; while Philip, after a moment's wonder, pursued
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) walk.

<p/>The Hollywell party entered Broadstone in a very different
temper, and greatly did they enjoy the concert, both for them-
selves and for each other. In the midst of it, while Amy was
intent on the Italian words of a song, Guy touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand,
and pointed to a line in the programme --

<p/>Solo on the Violin ... Mr. S. B. Dixon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) face with an expression full of inquiry ;
but it was no time for speaking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only saw how the
colour mantled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) cheek when the violinist appeared, and
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) looked down the whole time of the performance, only
now and then venturing a furtive though earnest glance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did not say anything till they were seated in the carriage,
and then astonished Mrs. Edmonstone by exclaiming --

<p/>' It must be my uncle ! -- I am sure it must. I'll ride to
Broadstone the first thing to-morrow, and find him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) out.''

<p/>' Your uncle ! ' exclaimed Mr. Edmonstone. ' I never thought
of that.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``S. B. Dixon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) name is Sebastian.
It cannot be any one else. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went to America.
How curious it is ! I suppose there is no fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) being gone
before I can come in to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I should think not. Those musical people keep late hours.''

<p/>' I would go before breakfast. Perhaps it would be best to go
to old Bedford, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will know all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; or to the music-
shop. I am so glad ! It is the very thing I always wished.''

<p/>' Did you ? ' said Mrs. Edmonstone to herself. * I can't say



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 125

<p/>every one would be of your mind ; but I can't help liking you
the better for it. I wish the man had kept further off, I wish
Mr. Edmonstone was at home. I hope no harm will come of
it. I wonder what I ought to do. Shall I caution him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ? No ; I
don't think I can spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) happiness -- and perhaps the man may
be improved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nearest relation, and I have no right to
interfere. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own good sense will protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) -- but I wish
Mr. Edmonstone was at home.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) therefore did not check his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) expressions of delight, nor
object to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) going to Broadstone early the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
had just dismounted before the inn-yard, when a boy put a note
into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so absorbed in its contents, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did
not perceive Philip till after two greetings had passed unheard.
When at length he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was recalled, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) started, and exclaimed,
rapturously, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put the note into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin's hand, --

<p/>' See here -- it is himself ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>' My uncle. My poor mother's own brother.''

<p/>' Sebastian Bach Dixon,<div class="bookquote">'' read Philip. ' Ha ! it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) who
took me for you yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sebastian Bach Dixon</b></font>)</div><p/>' I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) at the concert -- I was sure it could be no other.
I came in on purpose to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is waiting for me.
Is not it a happy chance ? '

<p/>' Happy ! ' echoed Philip, in a far different tone.

<p/>' How I have longed for this -- for any one who could remember
and tell me of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) -- of my mother -- my poor, dear young mother !
And her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own brother ! I have been thinking of it all night, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows I am here, and is as eager as myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is waiting
for me,'' ended Guy, hurrying off.

<p/>' Stop ! ' said Philip, gravely. ' Think before acting. I seriously
advise you to have nothing to do with this man, at least person-
ally. Let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and learn what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wants me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>impatiently answered Guy. <div class="bookquote">``You are not his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Thank heaven ! ' thought Philip. ' Do you imagine your
relationship is the sole cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seeking you ? '

<p/>' I don't know -- I don't care ! ' cried Guy, with vehemence.
' I will not listen to suspicions of my mother's brother.''

<p/>' It is more than suspicion. Hear me calmly. I speak for
your good. I know this man's influence was fatal to your
father. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did all in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power to widen the breach with
your grandfather.''

<p/>' That was eighteen years ago,'' said Guy, walking on, biting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip in a fiery tit of impatience.

<p/>' You will not hear. Remember, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) position and associates
render him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) no fit companion for you. Nay, listen patiently. You
cannot help tl\e relationship. I would not have you do otherwise
than assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Let liim not complain of neglect, but be on your
guard. He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will either seriously injure you, or be a burden for life.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard you so far -- I can hear no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, no



<p/>126 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>longer restraining his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) impetuosity. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is my uncle, that I
know ; I care for nothing else. Position -- nonsense ! what has
that to do with it '? I will not be set against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) strode off ; but in a few moments turned back, overtook
Philip, said --

<p/>' Thank you for your advice. I beg your pardon for my has-
tiness. You mean kindly, but I must see my uncle.'' And,
without waiting for an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>In short space he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was in the little parlour of the music-shop,
shaking hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) uncle, and exclaiming, --

<p/>' I am so glad ! I hoped it was you ! '

<p/>' It is very noble-hearted ! I might have known it would be
so with the son of my dearest sister and of my generous friend ! '
cried Mr. Dixon, with eagerness that had a theatrical air, though
it was genuine feeling that filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) eyes with tears.

<p/>' I saw your name last night,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Guy. ' I would have
tried to speak to you at once, but I was obliged to stay with
Mrs. Edmonstone, as I was the only gentleman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! I thought it possible you might not be able to follow
the dictates of your own heart ; but this is a fortunate conjunc-
ture, in the absence of your guardian.''

<p/>Guy recollected Philip's remonstrance, and it crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guardian might be of the same mind ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt
confident in having told all to Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>' How did you know I was here 1 ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) asked.

<p/>' I learnt it in a most gratifying way. Mr. Bedford, without
knowing our connection -- for on that I will always be silent --
mentioned that the finest tenor he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) had ever known, in an amateur,
belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) pupil, Sir Guy Morville. You can imagine my
feelings at finding you so near, and learning that you had in-
herited your dear mother's talent and taste.''

<p/>The conversation was long, for there was much to hear. Mr.
Dixon had kept up a correspondence at long intervals with
Markham, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) heard that his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) sister's child survived,
and was kindly treated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) grandfather ; and inquiring again
on the death of old Sir Guy, learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was gone to live
vv^ith his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guardian, whose name and residence Markham had not
thought fit to divulge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had been much rejoiced to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
name from the music-master, and lie went on to tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
been misled by the name of Morville into addressing the captain,
who had a good deal of general resemblance to Guy's father, a
fine tall young man, of the same upright, proud deportment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the son of the Archdeacon, and remembering
how strongly his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own proceedings had been discountenanced at
Stylehurst, had been much disconcerted ; and deeming the en-
counter a bad omen, had used more caution in liis advances to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) nephew. It was from sincere afiection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
acquaintance, though very doubtful as to the reception he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might
meet, and was both delighted and surprised at such unembar-
rassed, open-hearted affection.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 127

<p/>The uncle and nephew were not made to understand each
other. Sebastian Dixon was a man of little education, and when,
in early youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) talents had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own line,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had led a careless, extravagant life. Though an evil friend,
and fatal counsellor, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been truly attached to Guy's father,
and the secret engagement, and runaway marriage with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beau-
tiful sister, had been the romance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) life, promoted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
with no selfish end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was a proud and passionate man, and
resenting Sir Guy's refusal to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister as a daughter,
almost as much as Sir Guy was incensed at the marriage, had
led his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brother-in-law to act in a manner which cut off the hope
of reconciliation, and obliged Archdeacon Morville to give up
Ins cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gloried in supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
husband, and enabling them to set the old baronet at defiance.
But young Morville's territorial pride could not brook that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
should be maintained, and especially that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) child, the heir of
E-edclyft`e, should be born while he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was living at the expense of
a musician. This feeling, aided by a yearning for home, and a
secret love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) father, mastered his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) resentment ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
resolution, quarrelled with Dixon, and carried ofi'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wife, bent
with desperation on forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father into receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>Sebastian had not surmounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) anger at this step when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) learnt its fatal consequences. Ever since that time, nothing-
had prospered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) : he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had married and sunk himself lower,
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had an excellent engagement, the days were past
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) was the fashion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) gains and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) triumphs were
not what they had been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had a long list of disappointments
and jealousies with which to entertain Guy, who, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) side,
though resolved to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and dreading to be too refined to
be friends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) relations, could not feel as thoroughly
pleased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intended to have been.

<p/>Music was, however, a subject on which they could meet with
equal enthusiasm, and by means of this, together with the aid
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own imagination, Guy contrived to be very happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
stayed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could, and promised to
spend a day with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in London, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way to Oxford, in
October.

<p/>The next morning, when Philip knew that Guy would be with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) walked to Hollywell, came straight up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) aunt's
dressing-room, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to send Charlotte down to practise,
and, seating himself opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), began --

<p/>' What do you mean to do about this unfortunate rencontre ? '

<p/>' Do you mean Guy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is very much pleased,
poor boy ! I like his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entire freedom from false shame.''

<p/>' A little true shame would be hardly misplaced about such a
connection.''

<p/>' It is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fault, and I hope it will not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) misfortune,''
said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That it will certainly be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>replied Philip, `if we are not on
our guard ; and, indeed, if we are, there is little to be done with



<p/>128 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>one so wilful. I might as well have interfered with the course
of a whirlwind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Philip ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is too candid to be wilful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I cannot be of your opinion, when I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rushing
into this acquaintance in spite of the warnings he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must have
had here -- to say nothing of myself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, there I must defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), though you will think me
very unwise ; I could not feel that I ought to withhold him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
from taking some notice of so near a relation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip did think her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) so unwise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could only reply,
gravely --

<p/>' We must hope it may produce no evil effects.''

<p/>' How ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) exclaimed, much alarmed. ' Have you heard any-
thing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember, of course, that Guy's father was regularly
the victim of this Dixon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, yes ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has had enough to sober him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Do you
know nothing more ? ' said Mrs. Edmonstone, growing nervously
anxious lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been doing wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband's absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been inquiring about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) from old Bedford, and I
should judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be a most dangerous companion ; as, indeed,
I could have told from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) whole air, which is completely that
of a 7^oue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) paid me the compliment of taking me for Sir Guy,
and of course made off in dismay when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) discovered on whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had fallen. I have seldom seen a less creditable-looking
individual.''

<p/>' But what did Mr. Bedford say ? Did ho know of the connection ? '

<p/>' No ; I am happy to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) did not. The fellow has decency
enough not to boast of that. Well, Bedford did not know
much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) personally : he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) had once been much
thought of, and had considerable talent and execution ; but
taste changes, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) has lost something, so that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>)
stands tolerably high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) profession, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) is not a leader. So
much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) musical reputation. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) character, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bedford</b></font>) is one
of those people who are called no one's enemy but their own,
exactly the introduction Guy has hitherto happily wanted to
every sort of mischief.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to console herself,
' that Guy is too much afraid of small faults to be invited by
larger evils. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) punishes himself for an idle word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is
not likely to go wrong in greater matters.''

<p/>' Not at present.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the man in debt or difficulties? Guy heard nothing of
that, and I thought it a good sign.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ouglit not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has a fixed
salary, besides what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gets by playing at concerts when it is
not the London season. The wasting money on a spendthrift
relation would be a far less evil than what I apprehend.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 129

<p/>' I wish I knew what to do ! It is very unlucky that your
uncle is from home.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was frightened by the sense of responsibility,
and was only anxious to catch hold of something to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).

<p/>' What would you have me do ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) asked, hopelessly.

<p/>' Speak seriously to Guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must attend to you : he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cannot
fly out with a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does with me. Show him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the evils
that must result from such an intimacy. If Dixon was in dis-
tress, I would not say a word, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) would be bound to assist
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) ; but as it is, the acquaintance can serve no purpose but
degrading Guy, and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the way to evil. Above all,
make a point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) giving up visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in London. That is
the sure road to evil. A youth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) age, under the conduct
of a worn-out roue, connected with the theatres ! I can hardly
imagine anything more mischievous.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; I will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone,
perfectly appalled.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) promised, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) found the fulfilment difficult, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
dislike of vexing Guy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fear of saying what was wrong, and
a doubt whether the appearance of persecuting Mr. Dixon was
not the very way to prevent Guy's own good sense from finding
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) true character ; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) waited, hoping Mr. Edmonstone
might return before Guy went to Oxford, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might
write decisively.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone might have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband better than
to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to write decisively when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had neither herself
nor Philip at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) elbow. The same post had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a
letter from Guy, mentioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, and
frankly explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) plans for London ; another from Philip,
calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to use all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) authority to prevent this inter-
course, and a third from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wife. Bewildered between them,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister, who, being as puzzle-headed as him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)-
self, and only hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) involved history of the affair, confused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) still more ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wrote to Philip, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was sorry the
fellow had turned up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would guard against him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told
Guy he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was sorry to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle used to be a sad scamp,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must take care, or it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) poor father's story
over again ; and to Mrs. Edmonstone he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wrote that it was very
odd that everything always did go wrong when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was away.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought these letters a great achievement, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife's
perplexity was not materially relieved.

<p/>After considering a good while, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at length spoke to Guy ;
but it was not at a happy time, for Philip, despairing of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
had just taken on himself to remonstrate, and had angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to the verge of an outbreak.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone, as mildly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could, urged on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that
such intercourse could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) little satisfaction, and might
be very inconvenient ; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle was in no distress, and
did not require assistance ; and that it was too probable that

<p/>in seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) out he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might meet with persons who might
unsettle his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) principles, -- in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had much better give
up the visit to London.

<p/>' This is Philip's advice,'' said Guy.

<p/>' It is ; but '

<p/>Guy looked impatient, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) paused.

<p/>' You must forgive me,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, ' if I follow my own judgment.
If Mr. Edmonstone chose to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) commands on me, I suppose
I must submit ; but I cannot see that I am bound to obey Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not to obey, certainly ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) advice '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is prejudiced and unjust,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' I don't believe
that my uncle would attempt to lead me into bad company ;
and surely you would not have me neglect or look coldly on
one who was so much attached to my parents. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is not a
gentleman, and is looked down on by the world, it is not for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
sister's son to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conscious of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' I like your feelings, Guy ; I can Say nothing against it, but
that I am much afraid your uncle is not highly principled.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have only Philip's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You are resolved ? '

<p/>' Yes. I do not like not to take your advice, but I do believe
this is my duty. I do not think my determination is made in
self-will,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, thoughtfully ; ' I cannot think that I ought
to neglect my uncle, because I happen to have been born in a
different station, which is all I have heard proved against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, smiling. ' You will forgive me, will you not, for not
following your advice? for really and truly, if you will let me
say so, I think you would not have given it if Philip had not
been talking to you.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone confessed, with a smile, that perhaps it was
so ; but said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) trusted much to Philip's knowledge of the world.
Guy agreed to this ; though still declaring Philip had no right
to set him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) against his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle, and there the discussion ended.

<p/>Guy went to London. Philip thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very wilful, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt very weak ; and Mr. Edmonstone, on coming home,
said it could not be helped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wished to hear no more
about the matter.

<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) playful smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) buoyance wild,
Bespeak the gentle, mirthful child ;
But in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) forehead's broad expanse,
Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) chastened tones, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thoughtful glance,
Is mingled, with the child's light glee.
The modest maiden's dignity

<p/>One summer's day, two years after the ball and review, Mary
Ross and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) father were finishing their early dinner, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
said, --

<p/>' If you don't want me this afternoon, papa, I think I shall
walk to Hollywell. You know Eveleen de Courcy is there.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 131

<p/>' No, I did not. What has brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' As Charles expresses it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) has over-polked herself in London,
and is sent here for quiet and country air. I want to call on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>), and to ask Sir Guy to give me some idea as to the singing
the children should practise for the school-feast 1 '

<p/>* Then you think Sir Guy will come to the feast ? '

<p/>' I reckon on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to conceal all the deficiencies in the children's
singing.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) won't desert you, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did Mrs. Brownlow ? '

<p/>' O papa ! you surely did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to blame in that affair ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly, Mary, if I thought about the matter at all, I
thought it a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should go so much to the Brownlows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I believe I could tell you the history, if you thought it worth
while ; and though it may be gossip, I should like you to do
justice to Sir Guy.''

<p/>' Very well ; though I don't think there is much danger of my
doing otherwise. I only wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should become intimate
there at all.''

<p/>' I believe Mrs. Edmonstone thinks it right he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should see as
much of the world as possible, and not be always at home in
their own set.''

<p/>' Fair and proper.''

<p/>' You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could, -- had
Eveleen staying there, and the Miss Nortons, and hunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
out to parties, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had rather have been at home.''

<p/>' I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was fond of society. I remember your telling
me how amused you were with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first ball.''

<p/>' Ah ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was two years younger then, and all was new. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seems
to me too deep and sensitive not to find more pain than pleasure
in commonplace society. I have sometimes seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cannot
speak either lightly or harshly of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) disapproves, and people
don't understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). I was once sitting next him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), when there
was some talking going on about an elopement ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not laugh,
looked almost distressed, and at last said in a very low voice, to
me, <div class="bookquote">'' I wish people would not laugh about such things.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is an extraordinary mixture of gaiety of heart and
seriousness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Brownlow</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, when Mrs. Brownlow had her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) nieces with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>), and was
giving those musical parties, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) valuable ; and
Mrs. Edmonstone told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ought to go to them. I believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liked it at first, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found there was no end to it ; it took
up a great deal of time, and was a style of thing altogether that
was not desirable. Mrs. Edmonstone thought at first his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) reluct-
ance was only shyness and stay-at-home nonsense, that ought to
be overcome ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been there, and saw how Mrs.
Brownlow beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and the unpleasant fuss they made about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) singing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) quite came round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, and was very
sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Brownlow</b></font>) had exposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to so much that was disagreeable.''

<p/>' Well, Mary, I am glad to hear your account. My impression
arose from something Philip Morville said.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Captain Morville never can approve of anything Sir Guy
does ! It is not like Charles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How improved Charles Edmonstone is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has lost that
spirit of repining and sarcasm, and lives as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had an object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) employs himself now, and teaches Amy to do the
same. You know, after the governess went, we were afraid
little Amy would never do anything but wait on Charles, and
idle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pretty gentle way ; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) turned to better
things so did she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind has been growing all this time.
Perhaps you don't see it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has not lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) likeness to a
kitten, and looks all demure silence with the elders, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
takes in what the wise say.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is a very good little thing ; and I dare say will not be the
worse for growing up slowly.''

<p/>``Those two sisters are specimens of fast and slow growth.
Laura has always seemed to be so much more than one year
older than Amy, especially of late. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is more like five-and-
twenty than twenty. I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) overworks herself. But
how we have lingered over our dinner ! '

<p/>By half-past three, Mary was entering a copse which led into
Mr. Edmonstone's field, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heard gay tones, and a snatch
of one of the sweetest of old songs, --

<p/>Weep no more, lady ; lady, weep no more,

<p/>Thy sorrow is in vain ;
For violets pluck'd, the sweetest showers

<p/>Will ne'er make grow again.

<p/>A merry, clear laugh followed, and a turn in the path showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) Guy, Amy, and Charlotte, busy over a sturdy stock of
eglantine. Guy, little changed in these two years, -- not much
taller, and more agile than robust, -- was lopping vigorously with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) great pruning-knife, Amabel nursing a bundle of drooping
rose branches, Charlotte, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) bonnet in a garland of wild sweet-
brier, holding the matting and continually getting entangled in
the long thorny wreaths.

<p/>``And here comes the ``friar of orders gray,<div class="bookquote">'' to tell you so,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the friar</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Guy, as Mary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gray dress, came on them.

<p/>' Oh, that is right, dear good friar,'' cried Amy.

<p/>' We are so busy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte ; ' Guy has made Mr.
Markham send all these choice buds from Redclyffe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not from the park,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' Ave don't deal much in garden-
ing ; but Markham is a great florist, and these are his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) bounties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' And are you cutting that beautiful wild rose to pieces ? '

<p/>' Is it not a pity 1 ' said Amy. ' We have used up all the stocks
in the garden, and this is to be transplanted in the autumn.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lias been consoling it all the time by telling it it is for its
good,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' cutting off''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>wild shoots, and putting in better
things.''

<p/>' I never said anything so pretty ; and, after all, I don't know
that the grand roses will be equal to these purple shoots and
blushing buds with long whiskers.''

<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 133

<p/>' So Sir Guy was singing about the violets plucked to comfort
you. But you must not leave off, I want to see how you do it.
I am gardener enough to like to look on.''

<p/>' We have only two more to put in.''

<p/>Knife and lingers were busy, and Mary admired the dexterity
with which the slit was made in the green bark, well armed
with firm red thorns, and the tiny scarlet gem inserted, and
bound with cotton and matting. At the least critical parts of
the work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked after the rest of the party, and was answered
that papa had driven Charles out in the pony carriage, and tliat
Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn, reading and work-
ing with mamma. Eveleen was better, but not strong, or equal
to much exertion in the heat. Mary went on to speak of lier
school feast and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) questions.

<p/>' O Guy, you must not go before that ! ' cried Charlotte.

<p/>' Are you going away ? '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is very naughty, indeed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is going,
I don't know where all, to be stupid, and read mathematics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A true bill, I am sorry to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy ; <div class="bookquote">``I am to join a
reading-party for the latter part of the vacation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' I hope not before Thursday week, though we are not asking
you to anything worth staying for.''

<p/>' Oh, surely you need not go before that ! ' said Amy, `need you ? '

<p/>' No ; I believe I may stay till Friday, and I should delight in
the feast, thank you. Miss Ross, -- I want to study such things.
A bit more matting. Amy, if you please. There, I think tliat
will do.''

<p/>' Excellently. Here is its name. See how neatly Charlie has
printed it, Mary. Is it not odd, tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) prints so well when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
writes so badly ? '

<p/>' <div class="bookquote">'' The Seven Sisters.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There, fair sisterhood, grow and thrive,
till I come to transplant you in the autumn. Are there any more ? '

<p/>' No, that is the last. Now, Mary, let us come to mamma.''

<p/>Guy waited to clear the path of the numerous trailing briery
branches, and the others walked on, Amy telling how sorry they
were to lose Guy's vacation, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not
give time enough to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) studies here, and had settled, at Oxford,
to make one of a reading-party, under the tutorship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
friend, Mr. Wellwood.

<p/>' Where do they go 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not settled. Guy wished it to be the sea-side ; but
Philip has been recommending a farmhouse in Stylehurst
parish, rather nearer St. Mildred's Wells than Stylehurst, but
quite out in the moor, and an immense way from both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you think it will be the place ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Guy thinks it would suit Mr. Wellwood, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
has friends at St. Mildred's, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) vote for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
expects to hear how it is settled to-day or to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>Coming out on the lawn, they found the three ladies sitting
under the acacia, with their books and work. Laura did, indeed.



<p/>134 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>look older than her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) real age, as much above twenty as Amy
looked under nineteen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was prettier than ever ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) com-
plexion exquisite in delicacy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fine figure and the perfect out-
line of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) features more developed ; but the change from girl
to woman had passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and set its stamp on the anxious
blue eye, and almost oppressed brow. Mary thought it would
be hard to define where was that difference. It was not want of
bloom, for of that Laura had more than any of the others, fresh,
healthy, and bright, while Amy was always rather pale, and Lady
Eveleen w-as positively wan and faded by London and late hours ;
nor was it loss of animation, for Laura talked and laughed with
interest and eagerness ; nor was it thought, for little Amy, when
at rest, wore a meditative, pensive countenance ; but there was
something either added or taken away, which made it appear
that the serenity and carelessness of early youth had fled from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and the air of the cares of life had come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Mary told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) plans, -- Church service at four, followed by a
tea-drinking in the fields ; tea in the garden for the company,
and play for the school children and all who liked to join them.
Every one likes such festivals, which have the recommendation
of permitting all to do as they please, bringing friends together
in perfect ease and freedom, with an object that raises them above
the rank of mere gatherings for the pleasure of rich neighbours.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone gladly made the engagement and Lady
Eveleen promised to be quite well, and to teach the children all
manner of new games, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) greatly despised the dulness
of English children, and had many droll stories of the stupidity
of Laura's pupils, communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), with perhaps a little
exaggeration, by Charles, and still further embellished by herself,
for the purpose of exciting Charlotte's indignation.

<p/>Mary proceeded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) consultation about the singing, and was
conducted by Guy and Amy to the piano, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ears could
not be indoctrinated by their best efforts, they more than half
engaged to walk to East-hill, and have a conversation with the
new school-master, whom Mary pitied for having fallen on people
so unable to appreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) musical training as herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father. The whole party walked back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as far as the
shade lasted ; and at the end of the next field she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned, saw
them standing round the stile, thought what happy people they
were, and then resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wonder whither Laura's youthful-
ness had flown.

<p/>The situation of Philip and Laura had not changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regi-
ment had never been at any great distance from Hollywell, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) often came, venturing more as Laura learnt to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with
less trepidation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seldom or never was alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) influence was as strong as ever, and look, word, and gesture,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) alone could understand, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thoughts. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was devoted, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
doings were with a view to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and deserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) affection ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) world, and sole object. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was sometimes



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 135

<p/>startled by perceiving that tenderly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own family,
all were subordinate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had long since known the true
name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feelings for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not tell when or how the
certainty had come, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was conscious that it was love that
they had acknowledged for one another and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) only lived
in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not realize the evil of con-
cealment ; it was so deep a sensation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) innermost heart, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) never could imagine revealing it to any living creature, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had besides so surrendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) judgment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) idol, that no
thought could ever cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had enjoined what was wrong.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart and soul were his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) alone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) left the future to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
without an independent desire or reflection. All the embarrass-
ments and discomforts which her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) secret occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) were met
willingly for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sake, and these were not a few, though time had
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) more self-command, or, perhaps, more properly speak-
ing, had hardened her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) always had a dread of tete-d-tetes and conversations over
novels, and these were apt to be unavoidable when Eveleen was
at Hollywell. Tlie twilight wanderings on the terrace were a
daily habit, and Eveleen almost always paired with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). On this
evening in particular, Laura was made very uncomfortable by
Eveleen's declaring that it was positively impossible and unnatural
that the good heroine of some novel should have concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
engagement from her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) parents. Laura could not help saying that
there might be many excuses ; then afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was exciting
suspicion, changed the subject in great haste, and tried to make
Eveleen come indoors, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would tire herself to death,
and vexed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin's protestations that the fresh cool air
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) good. Besides, Eveleen was looking with attentive eyes
at another pair who were slowly walking up and down the shady
walk that bordered the grass-plot, and now and then standing
still to enjoy the subdued silence of the summer evening, and
the few distant sounds that marked the perfect lull.

<p/>' How calm -- how beautiful ! ' murmured Amabel.

<p/>' It only wants the low solemn surge and ripple of the tide, and
its dash on the rocks^' said Guy. ' If ever there was music, it is
there ; but it makes one think what the ear must be that can
take in the whole of those harmonies.''

<p/>' How I should like to hear it ! '

<p/>' And see it. O Amy ! to show you the sunny sea, -- the sense
of breadth and vastness in that pale clear horizon line, and the
infinite number of fields of light between you and it, -- and the
free feelings as you stand on some high crag, the wind blowing
in your face across half the globe, and the waves dashing far
below ! I am growing quite thirsty for the sea.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, papa said something about your taking your

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' True ; but I don't think Markham would like it, and it would
put old Mrs. Drew into no end of a fuss.''

<p/>' Not like to have you ? '



<p/>136 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' O yes, I should be all very well ; but if they heard I was
bringing three or four men with me, they would think them
regular wild beasts. They would be in an awful fright. Be-
sides, it is so long since I have been at home, that I don't alto-
gether fancy going there till I settle there for good.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! it will be sad going there at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it has not been my duty yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' But you will be glad when you get there 1 '

<p/>' Sha'n't I ? I wonder if any one has been to shoot the rabbits
on the shag rock. They must have quite overrun it by this time.
But I don't like the notion of the first day. There is not only
the great change, but a stranger at the vicarage,''

<p/>' Do you know anything about the new clergyman ? I believe
Mrs. Ashf ord is a connection of Lady Thorndale's ? '

<p/>' Yes ; Thorndale calls them pattern people, and I have no
doubt they will do great good in the parish. I am sure we want
some enlightenment, for we are a most primitive race, and some-
thing beyond Jenny Robinson's dame school would do us no harm.''

<p/>Here Mr. Edmonstone called from the window that they must
come in.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone thought deeply that night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had not
forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) notion that Eveleen was attracted by Guy's man-
ners, and had been curious to see what would happen when
Eveleen was sent to Hollywell for country air.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had a very good opinion of Lady Eveleen, Since the
former visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had shown more spirit of improvement, and laid
aside many little follies ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had put herself under Laura's guid-
ance, and tamed down into what gave the promise of a sensible
woman, more than anything that had hitherto been observed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ; and little addicted to match-making as Mrs. Edmonstone
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not help thinking that Eva was almost worthy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) dear Guy -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) never could expect to find any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) should
think quite worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was too like one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) own children
for that-RRB-, and on the other hand, how delighted Lord and Lady
Kilcoran would be. It was a very pretty castle in the air ; but
in the midst of it, the notion suddenly darted into Mrs. Edmon-
stone's head, that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) was thinking of it, it was Amy, not
Eveleen, who was constantly with Guy. Reading and music,
roses, botany, and walks on the terrace ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) looked back, and it
was still the same. Last Easter vacation, how they used to study
the stars in the evening, to linger in the greenhouse in the morn-
ing nursing the geraniums, and to practise singing oyer the
school-room piano ; how, in a long walk, they always paired to-
gether ; and how they seemed to share every pursuit or pleasure.

<p/>Now Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely fond of Guy, and trusted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entirely ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ought to consider how far this
should be allowed. Feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ought to see more of the
world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could into society, but it
had only made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cling closer to home. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was but twenty,
it was only a country neighbourhood, and there was much more



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 137

<p/>for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to see before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could fairly be supposed to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own
mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would act honourably ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had a horror
of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) entangle himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
fairly able to judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own feelings. Or, if this was only be-
having with a brother's freedom and confidence, Mrs. Edmonstone
felt it was not safe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) poor little Amy, who might learn so
to depend on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grievously when this intimacy
ceased, as it must when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) settled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own home. It would be
right, while it was still time, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) remember that they
were not brother and sister, and by checking their present happy,
careless, confidential intercourse, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) from the chill which
seemed to have been cast on Laura. Mrs. Edmonstone was the
more anxious, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) deeply regretted not having been suffi-
ciently watchful in Laura's case, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) felt an unac-
know^ledged conviction that if there was real love on Guy's part,
it would not be hurt by a little reserve on Amy's. Yet to have
to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little innocent daughter on such a matter dis-
turbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so much, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could hardly have set about it, if
Amy had not, at that very moment, knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) door.

<p/>' My dear, what has kept you up so late 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have been sitting in Eveleen's room, mamma, hearing
about her (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) London life ; and then we began to settle our plans for
to-morrow, and I came to ask what you think of them. You
know Guy has promised to go and hear the East-hill singing, and
we were proposing, if you did not mind it, to take the pony-car-
riage and the donkey, and go in the morning to East-hill, have
luncheon, and get Mary to go with us to the top of the great down,
where we have never been. Guy has been wanting us, for a long
time past, to go and see the view, and saying there is a track
quite smooth enough to drive Charlie to the top.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's look of hesitation. In fact, the
scheme was so accordant with their usual habits that it was im-
possible to find any objection ; yet it all hinged on Guy, and the
appointment at East-hill might lead to a great many more.

<p/>' Do you wish us to do anything else, mamma 1 We don't
care about it.''

<p/>' No, my dear,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, ' I see no reason against

<p/>it. But ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was making a desperate

<p/>plunge, ' there is something I want to say to you.''

<p/>Amy stood ready to hear, but Mrs. Edmonstone paused.
Another efibrt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) spoke : --

<p/>' Amy, my dear, I don't wish to find fault, but I thought of
advising you to take care. About Guy '

<p/>The very brilliant pink which instantly overspread Amy's face
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother think her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) warning more expedient.

<p/>' You have been spending a great deal of time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) of late,
very sensibly and pleasantly, I know ; I don't blame you at all,
my dear, so you need not look distressed. I only want you to be
careful. You know, though we call him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is scarcely a
relation at all.''



<p/>138 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>O mamma, don't go on/ said poor little Amy, hurriedly ;
' indeed I am very sorry ! '

<p/>For Amy understood that it was imputed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
had been forward and unmaidenly. Mrs. Edmonstone saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
extreme distress, and, grieved at the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had inflicted,
tried to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) as much as might be safe.

<p/>' Indeed, my dear, you have done nothing amiss. I only in-
tended to tell you to be cautious for fear you should get into a
way of going on which might not look well. Don't make any
great difference, I only meant that there should not be quite so
much singing and gardening alone mth him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), or walking in the
garden in the evening. You can manage to draw back a little,
so as to keep more with me or with Laura, and I think that will
be the best way.''

<p/>Every word, no matter what, increased the burning of poor
Amy's cheeks. A broad accusation of flirting would have been
less distressing to many girls than this mild and delicate warn-
ing was to one of such shrinking modesty and maidenly feeling.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had a sort of consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) enjoyed partaking in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) pursuits, and this made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sense of confusion and shame
overwhelming. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) been thoughtlessly doing ? She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
could not speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not lookc Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm
round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and Amy hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shoulder, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
fast. Mrs. Edmonstone kissed and caressed the little fluttering
bird, then saying, <div class="bookquote">``Good night, my own dear child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>unloosed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) embrace.

<p/>' Good night, dear mamma,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered Amy. ' I am very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>night mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not be sorry, my dear, only be careful. Good
night.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother daughter</b></font>)</div>And it would be hard to say whether the mother or the
daughter had the hottest cheeks.

<p/>Poor little Amy ! what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dismay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked herself,
again and again, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been doing and v/hat she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was to
do 1 The last was plain, -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew what was right, and do it
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must. There would be an end of much that was pleasant,
and a fresh glow came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) owned how very, very
pleasant ; but if it was not quite the thing, -- if mamma did not
approve, so it must be. True, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) doings received their zest
from Guy, -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart bounded at the very sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whistle,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) always heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) words through all the din of a whole party,
-- nothing was complete without him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), nothing good without his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
approval, -- but so much the more shame for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). It was a kind
of seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) which was of all things the most shocking. So
there should be an end of it, -- never mind the rest ! Amy knelt
down, and prayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) resolution.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not know how much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) severity towards herself
was learned from the example that had been two years before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) think whether the seeking had been mutual ;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) imagined it all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own doing, and did not guess that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would give pain to Guy by withdrawing herself from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>The morning gave vigour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) resolution, and wlien Laura



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 139

<p/>came to ask what mamma thought of their project, Amy looked
confused -- said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not know -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) believed it would not do.
But just then in came her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been consider-
ing of the expedition, and meant to join it herself. Amy under-
stood, blushed, and was silently grateful.

<p/>When Laura wanted to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) demeanour towards Guy,
being perfectly cool, and not in the least conscious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had acted
with great judgment, seen exactly what to do, and what to leave
undone, so as to keep up appearances. But it was not so with
Amy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was afraid of herself, and was in extremes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
would not come down till the last moment, that there might be
no talking in the window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hardly spoke at breakfast-time,
and adhered closely to Laura and Eveleen when they wandered
in the garden. Presently Charles looked out from the dressing-
room window, calling, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy, Guy is ready to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' I can't come. Read without me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) answered, hoping
Charlie would not be vexed, and feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face light up again.

<p/>The hour for the expedition came, and Amy set off walking
with Laura, because Guy was with Mrs. Edmonstone ; but pre-
sently, after holding open a gate for Charlotte, who was on the
donkey, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came up to the sisters, and joined in the conversation.
Amy saw something in the hedge -- a foxglove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) believed -- it
would have done as well if it had been a nettle -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stopped to
gather it, hoping to fall behind them, but they waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) grew silent, but Guy appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran on to Char-
lotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) donkey, but at the next gate Guy had joined
company again. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put herself under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's
wing, and by keeping with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did pretty well all the time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was at East-hill. But when they went on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was riding
the donkey, and it, as donkeys always are, was resolved on
keeping a-iiead of the walkers, so that as Guy kept by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) side,
it was a more absolute tete-d-tete than ever.

<p/>At the top of the hill they found a line view, rich and extensive,
broad woods, fields waving with silvery barley, trim meadows,
fair hazy blue distance, and a dim line of sea beyond. This, as
Amy knew, was Guy's delight ; and further, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not
tell herself, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) chiefly cared for showing it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). It
was so natural to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to admire everything beautiful, and ask
if it was equal to RedclyfFe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found herself already turning
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to participate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pleasure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pointed out all that
was to be seen ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) recollected, blushed, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother
to speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had much to show. There was a hanging wood on
one side of the hill, wlience he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more than one
botanical prize, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must now visit their native haunts. It
was too great a scramble for Mrs. Edmonstone, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) good
will ; Eveleen was to be kept still, and not to tire herself ; Laura
did not care for botany, nor love brambles ; and Amy was obliged
to stand and look into the wood, saying, ' No, thank you, I don't
think I can,'' and then run back to Mary and Charles ; while



<p/>140 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Charlotte was loudly calling out that it was delightful fun, and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was very stupid. In another minute Guy had overtaken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gentle, persuasive voice, was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) it was very
easy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must come and see the bird's-nest orchises. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
would have liked it above all things, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought it very kind
of Guy not to seem angry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, ' No, thank you.''

<p/>Mary, after what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen yesterday, could not guess at
the real reason, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought
Amy was tired, and would rather not. Poor Amy was tired,
very tired, before the walk was over, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) weary looks made
it worse, for Guy offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said, ' I am getting on very well ; ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) trudged on resolutely,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother was in the carriage, and to lag behind the others
would surely make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) keep with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fatigue, but Amy
found it a good excuse for not wandering in the garden, or join-
ing in the music. It had been a very uncomfortable day ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had done right ; at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had the peaceful
conviction of having tried to do so.

<p/>The next day. Amy was steady to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) resolution. No reading
with the two youths, though Charles scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
room till Guy was gone out, going indoors as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) return, and in the evening staying with Charles when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sisters and cousins went out ; but this did not answer, for Guy
came and sat by them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) moved away as soon as possible,
though very unwillingly ; but the more inclined she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was to linger,
the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought to go ; so murmuring something
about looking for Laura, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) threw on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) scarf, and sprung
to the window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) muslin caught on the bolt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) turned,
Guy was already disentangling it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eye. It was
full of anxious, pleading inquiry, which to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) seemed upbraid-
ing, and, not knowing what to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) exclaimed, hurriedly,
' Thank you ; no harm done ! ' and darted into the garden,
frightened to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face glowing and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart throbbing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not help looking back to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was following. No,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was not attempting it ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was leaning against the window,
and on she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hastened, the perception dawning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
was hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) rude, unkind, capricious,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) who had always been so kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was going
away so soon. ' But it is right ; it must be done,<div class="bookquote">'' said little
Amy to herself, standing still, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was out of sight.
' If I was wrong before, I must bear it now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will see the
rights of it sooner or later. The worst of all would be my not
doing the very most right to please any body. Besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) can't
really care for missing silly little Amy when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has mamina and
Charlie. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is going away, so it will be easier to begin right
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) comes back. Be that as it may, it must be done. I'll get
Charlie to tell me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was saying about the painted glass.''

<p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>Oh, thou child of many prajers !
Life hath quicksands-- life hath snares-
Care and age come unawares.

<p/>Like the swell of some sweet tune,

<p/>Morning rises into noon.

<p/>May glides onward into June.-- Loncfkllow

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with Amy ? What makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so odd ? '
asked Charles, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother came to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good night.

<p/>' Poor little dear ! don't take any notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>was all the answer
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) received ; and seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was to be told no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) held
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) peace.

<p/>Laura understood without being told. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), too, had thought
Guy and Amy were a great deal together, and combining various
observations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother must have given
Amy a caution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) therefore set herself, like a good sister, to
shelter Amy as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could, save her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from awkward situ-
ations, and, above all, to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) altered manner from being
remarked. This was the less difficult, as Eveleen was subdued
and languid, and more inclined to lie on the sofa and read than
to look out for mirth.

<p/>As to poor little Amy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) task was in one way become less
hard, for Guy had ceased to haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and seemed to make it
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) business to avoid all that could cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) embarrassment ;
but in another way it hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) much more, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) now saw the
pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was causing. If obliged to do anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would give a look as if to ask pardon, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rebellious
heart would so throb with joy as to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dismay at having
let herself fall into so hateful a habit as wishing to attract
attention. What a struggle it was not to obey the impulse of
turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for the smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would greet anything
in conversation that interested them both, and how wrong she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
thought it not to be more consoled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) talking to
Eveleen, or to any of the others, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was doing veiy well
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). This did not often happen ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was evidently out
of spirits, and thoughtful, and Amy was afraid some storm
might be gathering respecting Mr. Sebastian Dixon, about whom
there always seemed to be some uncomfortable mystery.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone saw everything, and said nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was
very sorry for them both, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not interfere, and could
only hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had done right, and protected Amy as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
was able. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was vexed now and then to see Eveleen give
knowing smiles and significant glances, feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) guessed
what was going on, and wondered whether to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) a hint not
to add to Amy's confusion ; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) great dislike to enter on
such a subject prevailed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left things to take their course,
thinking that, for once, Guy's departure would be a relief.

<p/>The approach of anything in the shape of a party of pleasure



<p/>142 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>was one of the best cures for Eveleen's ailments, and the even-
ing before Mary's tea-drinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in high spirits, laughing
and talking a great deal, and addressing herself chiefly to Guy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exerted himself to answer, but it did not come with life and
spirit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) countenance did not light up, and at last Eveleen said,
' Ah ! I see I am a dreadful bore. I'll go away, and leave you
to repose.''

<p/>' Lady Eveleen ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed, in consternation ; ' what have
I been doing -- what have I been thinking of ? '

<p/>' Nay, that is best known to yourself, though I think perhaps
I could divine,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>), with that archness and grace that
always seemed to remove the unfavourable impression that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
proceedings might have given. ' Shall I ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered, colouring crimson, and then trying to
laugh off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confusion, and find some answer, but without
success ; and Eveleen, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) aunt's eyes were upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>),
suddenly recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had gone quite as far as decorum
allowed, and made as masterly a retreat as the circumstances
permitted.

<p/>' Well, I have always thought a <div class="bookquote">'' penny for your thoughts ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the boldest offer in the world, and now it is proved.''

<p/>This scene made Mrs. Edmonstone doubly annoyed, the next
morning, at waking with a disabling headache, which made it
quite impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to attempt going to Mary Ross's fete.
With great sincerity. Amy entreated to be allowed to remain at
home, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought it would only be making the change
more remarkable ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not wish Mary to be disappointed ;
among so many ladies. Amy could easily avoid getting into
difiiculties ; while Laura would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) trusted, be able to keep
Eveleen in order.

<p/>The day was sunny, and all went off to admiration. The gen-
tlemen presided over the cricket, and the ladies over ' blind man's
buff ' and `thread my needle;' but perhaps Mary was a little
disappointed that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had Sir Guy's bodily presence, the
peculiar blitheness and animation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) usually shed around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) were missing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sung at church, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) filled tiny cups from
huge pitchers of tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) picked up and pacified a screaming child
that had tumbled off a gate -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was as good-natured and useful
as possible, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) joyous and brilliant self.

<p/>Amy devoted herself to the smallest fry, played assiduously
for three quarters of an hour with a fat, grave boy of three, who
stood about a yard-and-a-half from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), solemnly tlirowing a ball
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lap, and never catching it again, took charge of many
caps and bonnets, and walked about with Louisa Harper, a
companion whom no one envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>In conclusion, the sky clouded over, it became chilly, and a
shower began to fall. Laura pursued Eveleen, and Amy hunted
up Charlotte from the utmost parts of the field, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
the very centre of ' winding up the clock,'' and sorely against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will, dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) off the wet grass. About sixty yards from



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYEFE 143

<p/>the house, Guy met them with an umbrella, which, Avithout
speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gave to Charlotte. Amy said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>and
again came that look. Charlotte rattled on, and hung back to
talk to Guy, so that Amy could not hasten on without leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shelterless. It may be believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had the conversa-
tion to herself. At the door they met Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father,
going to dismiss their flock, who had taken refuge in a cart-shed
at the other end of the field. Guy asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could be of any
use ; Mr. Eoss said no ; and Mary begged Amy and Charlotte
to go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room, and change their wet shoes.

<p/>There, Amy would fain have stayed, flushed and agitated as
those looks made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; but Charlotte was in wild spirits, delighted
at having been caught in the rain, and obliged to wear shoes a
mile too large, and eager to go and share the fun in the drawing-
room. There, in the twilight, they found a mass of young
ladies herded together, making a confused sound of laughter, and
giggling, while at the other end of the room, Amy could just see
Guy sitting alone in a dark corner.

<p/>Charlotte's tongue was soon the loudest in the medley, to which
Amy did not at first attend, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard Charlotte saying --

<p/>' Ah ! you should hear Guy sing that.''

<p/>' What 1 ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whispered to Eveleen.

<p/>' <div class="bookquote">'' The Land of the Leal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div>' was the answer,

<p/>' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would sing it now,'' said Ellen Harper.

<p/>' This darkness would be just the time for music,<div class="bookquote">'' said Eveleen ;
' it is quite a witching time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ellen</b></font>)</div>said Ellen. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Charlotte,
there's a good girl, go and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Shall I ? ' said Charlotte, whispering and giggling with an
affectation of shyness.

<p/>' No, no, Charlotte,'' said Laura.

<p/>' No ! why not ? ' said Eveleen. ' Don't be afraid, Charlotte.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) is so grave,'' said Charlotte.

<p/>Eveleen had been growing wilder and less guarded all day, and
now, partly liking to tease and surprise the others, and partly
emboldened by the darkness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) answered, --

<p/>' It will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) all manner of good. Here, Charlotte, I'll tell
you how to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>). Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) Amy wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) to do it.''

<p/>' Ay ! tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) so,'' cried Ellen, and they laughed in a manner
that overpowered Amy with horror and shyness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sprung to
seize Charlotte, and stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not speak, but Louisa
Harper caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arm, and Laura's grave orders were drowned
in a universal titter, and suppressed exclamation, -- ' Go, Char-
lotte, go ; we will never forgive you if you don't ! '

<p/>' Stop ! ' Amy struggled to cry, breaking from Louisa, and
springing up in a sort of agony. Guy, who had such a horror
of singing anything deep in pathos or religious feeling to mixed
or unfit auditors, asked to do so in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) name ! ' Stop ! oh, Char-
lotte ! ' It was too late ; Charlotte, thoughtless with merriment,
amused at vexing Laura, set up with applause, and confident in



<p/>144 THE HEIK OF EEDCLYFFE

<p/>Guy's good nature, had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and was saying, -- ' Oh, Guy !
Amy wants you to come and sing us the <div class="bookquote">'' Land of the Leal.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Ajny saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) start up. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>)? Oh,
what ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stepped towards them. The silly girls cowered as if
they had roused a lion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice was not loud -- it was almost
as gentle as usual ; but it quivered, as if it was hard to keep it
so, and, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) could see, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face was rigid and stern as
iron. ' Did you wish it ? ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, addressing himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>), as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) was the only person present.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) breath was almost gone. * Oh ! I beg your pardon,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>)
faltered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) could not exculpate herself ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) saw it looked like
an idle, almost like an indecorous trick, unkind, everything
abhorrent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), especially in the present state of
things. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes were on her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head bent towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
waited for an answer. ' I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) could say.

<p/>There was -- yes, there was -- one of those fearful flashes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
kindling eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>) was shrinking to nothing ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Leal</b></font>)
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) say, in a low, hoarse tone, ' I am afraid I cannot ; '
then Mr. Ross, Mary, lights came in ; there was a bustle and
confusion, and when next she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was clearly conscious, Laura was
ordering the carriage.

<p/>When it came, there was an inquiry for Sir Guy.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is gone home,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Ross. ' I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) in the passage,
and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) good night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Ross did not add what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) afterwards told his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) daughter,
that Guy seemed not to know whether it was raining or not ;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had put an umbrella into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, and seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) march
off at full speed, through the pouring rain, with it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm.

<p/>The ladies entered the carriage. Amy leant back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) corner ;
Laura forbore to scold either Eveleen or Charlotte till she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could
have them separately ; Eveleen was silent, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) was
dismayed at the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had produced, and Charlotte, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew there was a scolding impending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>They found no one in the drawing-room but Mr. Edmonstone
and Charles, who said they had heard the door open, and Guy
run up-stairs, but they supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was wet through, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) appearance. It was very inhospitable in the girls
not to have made room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the carriage.

<p/>Amy went to see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother was, longing to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
whole trouble, but found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asleep, and was obliged to leave it
till the morrow. Poor child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) slept very little, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would
not go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother before breakfast, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should provoke
the headache into staying another day. Guy was going by the
train at twelve o'clock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was resolved that something
should 136 done ; so, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father had wished Guy good-
bye, and ridden off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) justice meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother to come into the dressing-room, and hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
to say.

<p/>' Oh, mamma ! the most dreadful thing has happened ! ' and,
hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) story, ending with a burst of weep-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 145

<p/>ing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said how Guy was displeased. ' And well he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mighli
be ! That after all that has vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) this week, I should tease
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with such a trick. Oh, mamma, what must he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think ? '

<p/>' My dear, there was a good deal of silliness ; but you need not
treat it as if it was so very shocking.''

<p/>' Oh, but it hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was angry, and now I know how it
is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is angry with himself for being angry. Oh, how foolish
I have been ! What shall I do ? '

<p/>' Perhaps we can let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) know it was not your fault,'' said
Mrs. Edmonstone, thinking it might be very salutary for Char-
lotte to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to confess.

<p/>' Do you think so ? ' cried Amy, eagerly. ' Oh ! tliat would
make it all comfortable. Only it was partly mine, for not keep-
ing Charlotte in better order, and we must not throw it all on
lier and Eveleen. You think we may tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Char</b></font>) ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ought not to be allowed to fancy you let your
name be so used.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>A message came for Mrs. Edmonstone, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was
attending to it. Amy hastened away, fully believing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother had authorized her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to go and explain it to Guy, and ask
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pardon. It was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought the natural thing to do,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was soon by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) side, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pacing, with folded
arms, under the wall.

<p/>Much had lately been passing in Guy's mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gone
on floating on the sunny stream of life at Hollywell, too happy
to observe its especial charm till the change in Amy's manner
cast a sudden gloom over all. Not till then did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) understand
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own feelings, and recognize in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) the being he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had dreamt
of. Amy was what made Hollywell precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Sternly
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was wont to treat his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) impulses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not look on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
affection as an earthborn fancy, liable to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) from higher
things, and, therefore, to be combated ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rather
a guide and guard whose love might arm him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and
encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had little hope, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not do justice
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) powers of inspiring affection ; no one could distrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
temper and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) character as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did himself, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
ancestry and the doom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) believed attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) race, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
own youth and untried principles, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) undesirable con-
nections, and the reserve he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was obliged to exercise regarding
them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) considered himself as objectionable a person as could
well be found, as yet untouched by any positive crime, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
respected the Edmonstones too much to suppose that these
disadvantages could be counterbalanced for a moment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
position ; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) interpreted Amy's coolness by supposing
that there was a desire to discourage his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attentions. No poor
tutor or penniless cousin ever felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was doing a more desperate
thing in confessing an attachment, than did Sir Guy Morville
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) determined that all should be told, at the risk of losing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for ever, and closing against himself the doors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) happy
home. It was not right and fair by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) parents, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) thougiit,

<p/>so to regard their daughter, and live in the same house with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sentiments una vowed, and as to Amy herself, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) feelings
had reached such a pitch of sensitiveness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) must needs
behave like an angry lion, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) name had been dragged
into an idle joke, it was high time it should be explained,
unpropitious as the moment might be for declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) attach-
ment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had manifested such a temper as any woman
might dread. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) mind that, come of it what
might, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would not leave Hollywell that day till the truth was
told. Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was turning to find Mrs. Edmonstone and ' put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) fate to the touch,'' a little figure stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), and Amy's
own sweet, low tones were saying, imploringly,--

<p/>' Guy, I wanted to tell you how sorry I am you were so teased
last night,''

<p/>' Don't think of it ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), taken extremely by surprise.

<p/>' It was our fault, I could not stop it ; I should have kept
Charlotte in better order, but they would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hear me.
I knew it was what you dislike particularly, and I was very sorry.''

<p/>' You -- I was -- I was. But no matter now. Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added
earnestly, `may I ask you to walk on with me a little way?
I must say something to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Was this what ' mamma' objected to 1 Oh no ! Amy felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
must stay now, and, in truth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was glad it was right, though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart beat fast, fast, faster, as Guy, pulling down a long,
trailing branch of Noisette rose, and twisting it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand,
paused for a few moments, then spoke collectedly, and without
hesitation, though with the tremulousness of subdued agitation,
looking the while not at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), but straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>' You ought to be told why your words and looks have such
effect on me as to make me behave as I did last night. Shame
on me for such conduct ! I know its evil, and how preposterous
it must make what I have to tell you. I don't know how long
it has been, but almost ever since I came here, a feeling has been
growing up in me towards you, such as I can never have for any
one else.''

<p/>The flame rushed into Amy's cheeks, and no one could have
told what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) paused again, and then went on speaking
more quickly, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) emotion was less under control.

<p/>' If ever there is to be happiness for me on earth, it must be
through you ; as you, for the last three years, have been all my
brightness here. What I feel for you is beyond all power of
telling you. Amy ! But I know full well all there is against me --
I know I am untried, and how can I dare to ask one born to
brightness and happiness to share the doom of my family ? '

<p/>Amy's impulse was that anything shared with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would be
welcome ; but the strength of the feeling stifled the power of
expression, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not utter a word.

<p/>' It seems selfish even to dream of it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) proceeded ; ' yet
I must,-- I cannot help it. To feel that I had your love to keep
me safe, to know that you watched for me, prayed for me, were




<p/>I would not even ask you to answer me now, far less to bind yourself, even if- if it were
possible. ''--Pa^$ 147.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 147

<p/>my own, my Verena, -- oh Amy ! it would be more joy than
I have ever dared to hope for. But mind,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added, after another
brief pause, ' I would not even ask you to answer me now, far
less to bind yourself, even if -- if it were possible. I know my
trial is not come ; and were I to render myself, by positive act,
unworthy even to think of you, it would be too dreadful to have
entangled you, and made you unliappy. No. I speak now,
because I ought not to remain here with such feelings unknown
to your father and mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment, close on the other side of the box-tree clump,
were heard the wheels of Charles's garden-chair, and Charlotte's
voice talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) morning tour round the
garden. Amy flew off, like a little bird to its nest, and never
stopped till, breathless and crimson, slie darted into the dressing
room, threw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knees, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face hidden in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's lap, exclaimed, in panting, half -smothered whispers,
which needed all Mrs. Edmonstone's intuition to make them
intelligible, --

<p/>' O mamma, mamma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) says -- lie says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) loves me ! '

<p/>Perhaps Mrs. Edmonstone was not so very much surprised ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had no time to do more than raise and kiss the burning
face, and see, at a moment's glance, how bright was the gleam
of frightened joy, in the downcast eye and troubled smile ; when
two knocks, given rapidly, were heard, and almost at the same
moment the door opened, and Guy stood l^efore her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face
no less glowing than that which Amy buried again on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother's knee.

<p/>' Come in, Guy,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood doubtful
for a moment at the door, and there was a sweet smile of proud,
joyful aifection on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) face, conveying even more encouragement
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tone. Amy raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head, and moved as if to leave
tlie room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, earnestly, `unless you wish it.''

<p/>Amy did not wish it, especially now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother
to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) confusion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat on a footstool, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother's hand, looking up to Guy, whenever slie felt bold enough,
and hanging down her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said what showed how mucli
more highly he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) prized her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) than silly little Amy could deserve.

<p/>' You know what I am come to say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began, standing by the
mantel-shelf, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wont in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conferences with Mrs. Ed-
monstone ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repeated the same in substance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had said
to Amy in the garden, though with less calmness and coherence,
and far more warmth of expression, as if, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
protected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's presence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exercised less force in
self-restraint.

<p/>Never was any one happier than was Mrs. Edmonstone ; loving
Guy so heartily, seeing the beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) character in each word,
rejoicing that such affection should be bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little
Amy, exulting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) having won such a heart, and touched and
gratified by the free confidence with which both had at once.

<p/>hastened to pour out all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), not merely as a duty, but in the
full ebullition of their warm j^oung loA^e. The only difiiculty
was to bring herself to speak with prudence becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) posi^
tion, whilst she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was sympathizing with them as ardently as it
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not older than both of them put together. When Guy
spoke of himself as unproved, and undeserving of trust, it was
all she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could do to keep from declaring there was no one whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought so safe. ^

<p/>' While you go on as you have begun, Guy i
' If you tell me to hope ! Oh, Mrs. Edmonstone, is it wrong
that an earthly incentive to persevere should have power which
sometimes seems greater than the true one ?'' ^ ^

<p/>' There is the best and strongest ground of all for trusting you,
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). ' If you spoke of keeping right only for Amy s sake, then
I might fear ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is second, there is confidence indeed.''
' If speaking were all ! ' said Guy. -, , , i

<p/>' There is one thing I ought to say,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) proceeded ; you know
you are very young, and though-- though I don't know that i
can say so in my own person, a prudent woman would say, that
you have seen so little of the world, that you may easily meet a
person you would like better than such a quiet little dull thing
as your guardian's daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>The look that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cast on Amy was worth seeing, and then,
with a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered -- ^

<p/>' I am glad you don't say it in your own person.
' It is very bold and presumptuous in me to say anything at
all in papa's absence,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling ; but I
am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will think in the same way, that things ought to
remain as they are, and that it is our duty not to allow you to
be, or to feel, otherwise than entirely at liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say it may be right in you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, grudgingly
' However, I must not complain. It is too much that you should
not reject me altogether.''

<p/>To all three that space was as bright a gleam of sunshine as
ever embellished life, so short as to be free from a single care, a
perfectly serenely happy present, the more joyous from having
been preceded by vexations, each of the two young things learn-
ing that there was love where it was most precious. Guy
especially, isolated and lonely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood m life, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tear
and mistrust of himself, was now not only allowed to love, and
assured beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hopes that Amy returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) affection, but
found himself thus welcomed by the mother, and gathered into
the family where his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) warm feelings had taken up their abode,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) believed himself regarded only as a guest and a stranger.
They talked on, with happy silences between, Guy standing
all the time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) branch of roses in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, and Amy look-
ing up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and trying to realize it, and to understand why
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so very, very happy. , i . ti i-i

<p/>No one thought of time till Charlotte rushed m, like a whirl-
wind, crying --



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 149

<p/>' Oh, here you are ! We could not think what had become of
you. There has Deloraine been at the door these ten minutes,
and Charlie sent me to find you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) says if you are too late
for Mrs. Henley's dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) will write such an account of you
to Philip as you will never get over.''

<p/>Very little of this was heard, there was only the instinctive
consternation of being too late. They started up, Guy threw
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) roses, caught Amy's hand and pressed it, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bent
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head, hiding the renewed blush ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dashed out of the
room, and up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own, while Mrs. Edmonstone and Charlotte
hurried down. In another second, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was back again, and once
more Amy felt the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand on hers --

<p/>' Good-bye ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said -RSB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) whispered another ' Good-bye ! '
the only words she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had spoken.

<p/>One moment more he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lingered, --

<p/>' My Verena ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; but the hurrying sounds in the hall
warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sprang down to the drawing-room. Even
Charles was on the alert, standing, leaning against the table, and
looking eager ; but Guy had not time to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only
shook hands, and wished good-bye, with a sort of vehement
agitated cordiality, concealed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) haste.

<p/>' Where's Amy 1 ' cried Charlotte. ' Amy ! Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) coming
to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good-bye ? '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said something, of which ' up-stairs ' was the only audible
word ; held Mrs. Edmonstone's hand fast, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said, in a
low voice--' You shall hear from papa to-morrow,'' then sprung
on his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) horse, and looked up. Amy was at the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head bending forward, under its veil of curls, in the midst of
the roses round the lattice ; their eyes met once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) gave
one beamy smile, then rode off at full speed, with Bustle racing
after him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), while Amy threw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knees by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bed, and
with hands clasped over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face, prayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might be
thankful enough, and never be unworthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).

<p/>Every one wanted to get rid of every one else except Mrs.
Edmonstone ; for all but Charlotte guessed at the state of the
case, and even she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) perceived that something was going on. Lady
Eveleen was in a state of great curiosity ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had mercy,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) knew that they must tell each other before it came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)
turn, and very good-naturedly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) invited Charlotte to come into
the garden with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) out of the way by a full
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) last fancy ball, given with so much spirit and
liumour that Charlotte could not help attending.

<p/>Charles and Laura gained little by this kind manoeuvre, for
their mother was gone up again to Amy, and they could only
make a few conjectures, Charles nursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) right hand, and asked
Laura how hers felt ? She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) work, to whicli
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had begun to apply herself diligently, and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
inquiringly, as if to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) intended anything.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my part,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I certainly thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meant to
carry off the hands of some of the family.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>150 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I suppose we shall soon hear it explained,'' said Laura, quietly.

<p/>* Soon ! If I had as many available legs as you, would I wait
for other people's soon ^ '

<p/>' I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had rather be left to mamma,'' said Laura,
going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you do think there is something in if?''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles,
peering up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was teasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), recollected
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had long seemed out of spirits, and forbore to say any
more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was, however, too impatient to remain longer quiet,
and presently Laura saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crutches.

<p/>' O Charlie ! I am sure it will only be troublesome.''

<p/>' I am going to my own room,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, hopping off. ' I
presume you don't wish to forbid that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) room had a door into the dressing-room, so that it was an
excellent place for discovering all from which they did not wish
to exclude him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should be unwelcome ;
for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might pretend it was all fun and curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
heartily loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) little Amy.

<p/>The tap of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crutches, and the slow motion with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
raised himself from step to step, was heard ; and Amy, who was
leaning against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, started up, exclaiming --

<p/>' O mamma, here comes Charlie ! May I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) 1 I am sure
I can't meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) without.''

<p/>' I suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has guessed it already,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone,
going to open the door, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reached the head of the stairs,
and then leaving them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), looking full at her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) carnation cheeks,
' are you prepared to see me turn lead-coloured, and fall into
convulsions, like the sister with the spine complaint ? '

<p/>' O Charlie ! You know it. But how ? '

<p/>Amy was helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to the sofa, laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) down, and sat by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) on the old footstool ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) neck, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Amy, I give you joy, my small woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), talking
the more nonsense because of the fulness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) throat ; ' and I
hope you give me credit for amazing self-denial in so doing.''

<p/>' O Charlie -- dear Charlie ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not
blush more, poor little thing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had already reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
utmost capability of redness--' it is no such thing.''

<p/>' No such thing ! What has turned you into a turkey-cock
all at once, or what made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) nearly squeeze off my unfortunate
<div class="bookquote">``fingers ? No such thing, indeed ! '

<p/>' I mean -- I mean, it is not that. We are so very young, and
I am so silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) reason 1 '

<p/>' You miist make me so much better and wiser. Oh, if I could
but be good enough ! '

<p/>' For that matter, I don't think any one else would be good
enough to take care of such a silly little thing. But what is
the that^ that it is, or is not ^ '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing now, only when we are older. At least, you know
papa has not heard it.''

lady added to all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) responses through the marriage service.

secrets now, Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edmonstone had, meantime, gone down to Laura. Poor
Laura, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother had left the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) allowed the
fixed composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face to relax into a restless, harassed,
almost miserable expression, and walked up and down with
agitated steps.

<p/>' O wealth, wealth ! ' -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) lips formed the words, without utter-
ing them -- ' what cruel differences it makes ! All smooth here !
Young, not to be trusted, with strange reserves, discreditable
connections, -- that family, -- that fearful temper, showing itself
even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ! All will be overlooked ! Papa will be delighted,
I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) will ! And how is it with us 1 Proved, noble, superior,
owned as s.uch by all, as Philip is, yet, for that want of hateful
money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be spurned. And for this -- for this -- the love
that has grown up with our lives must be crushed down and
hidden -- our life is wearing out in wearying self -watching ! '

<p/>The lock of the door turned, and Laura had resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ordi-
nary expression before it opened, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother came in ; but
there was anything but calmness beneath, for the pang of self-
reproach had come -- <div class="bookquote">``Was it thus that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) prepared to hear
these tidings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, Laura,'' began Mrs. Edmonstone, with the eager smile
of one bringing delightful news, and sure of sympathy.

<p/>' It is so, then 1 ' said Laura. ' Dear, dear, little Amy ! I
hope -- ' and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes filled with tears ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had learnt to
dread any outbreak of feeling, conquered it in a minute, and
said --

<p/>' What has happened 1 How does it stand ? '

<p/>' It stands, at least as far as I can say without papa, as the
dear Guy very rightly and wisely wished it to stand. There is
no positive engagement, they are both too young ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thought it was not right to remain here without letting us
know his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sentiments towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).''

<p/>A pang shot through Laura ; but it was but for a moment.
Guy might doubt where Philip need never do so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother
went on, --

<p/>' Their frankness and confidence are most beautiful. Wo know
dear little Amy could not help it ; but there was something
very sweet, very noble, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) way of telling all.''

<p/>Another pang for Laura. But no ! it was only poverty that
was to blame. Philip would speak as plainly if his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) prospects
were as fair.

<p/>' Oh, I hope it will do well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>' It must,^t will ! ' cried Mrs. Edmonstone, giving way to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) joyful enthusiasm of affection. <div class="bookquote">``It is nonsense to doubt.

<p/>knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as we do. There is not a man in the world with
whom I could be so happy to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Laura could not hear Guy set above all men in the world, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) remembered Philip's warning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), two years ago.

<p/>' There is much that is very good and very delightful about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said, hesitatingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of the Morville temper,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother :
' but I am not afraid of it. A naturally hot temper, controlled
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) by strong religious principle, is far safer than a cool
easy one, without the principle.''

<p/>Laura thought this going too far ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) felt some compen-
sation due to Guy, and acknowledged how strongly he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
actuated by principle. However -- and it was well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) --
they could not talk long, for Eveleen and Charlotte were ap-
proaching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hastily asked what was to be done about
telling Eva, who could not fail to guess something.

<p/>' We must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) promise absolute secrecy,<div class="bookquote">''
said Mrs. Edmonstone. ' I will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) myself ; but I
must wait till I have seen papa. There is no doubt of what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
will say ; but we have been taking quite liberties enough in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
absence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sister till luncheon, when Amy came
down, with a glow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cheeks that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so much prettier
than usual, that Charles wished Guy could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said little, and ran up again as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could. Laura followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; and the two sisters threw their arms fondly round each
other, and kissed repeatedly.

<p/>' Mamma has told you ? ' said Amy. ' Oh, it has made me so
very happy ; and every one is so kind.''

<p/>' Dear, dear Amy ! '

<p/>' I'm only afraid '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has begun so well '

<p/>' Oh, nonsense ! You cannot think I could be so foolish as to
be afraid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? Oh no ! But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should take me for more
than I am worth. O Laura, Laura ! What shall I do to be as
good and sensible as you ! I must not be silly little Amy any
more.''

<p/>' Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) likes you best as you are ? '

<p/>' I don't mean cleverness : I can't help that, -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knows
how stupid I am, -- but I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thinks there is more
worth in me. Don't you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has a sort of sunshine in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes and mind, that makes all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cares about seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
brighter and better than it really is. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is only
dressing me up with that sunshine.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be strange sunshine that you want to make you
better and brighter than you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hands, and

once, to have no bones in my character. I must learn to be

anybody ; but to be -- you know what -- if a exation or trouble

and I was to fail ! Oh, do help me to have firmness and self-
command, like you ! '

<p/>' It was a long time ago that we talked of your wanting bones.''

<p/>' Yes, before he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) came ; but I never forget it.''

<p/>Laura was obliged to go out with Eveleep. All went their
different ways ; and Amy had the garden to herself to cool her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
cheeks in. But this was a vain operation, for a fresh access of
burning was brought on while Laura was helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to dress
for dinner, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father's quick step sounded in the passage.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) door, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) opened it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) on
each cheek ; and throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), exclaimed, --

<p/>' Well, Miss Amy, you have made a fine morning's work of it !
A pretty thing, for young ladies to be accepting offers while
papa is out of the way. Eh, Laura ? '

<p/>Amy knew this was a manifestation of extreme delight ; but
it was not very pleasant to Laura.

<p/>' So you have made a conquest ! ' proceeded Mr, Edmonstone ;
`and I heartily wish you joy of it, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) is as amiable
and good-natured a youth as I would wish to see ; and I should
say the same if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had not a shilling in the world.''

<p/>Laura's heart bounded ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father
might fancy, the reality would be very different if Guy were as
poor as Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) this very evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) continued, `and

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)'s a good little thing -- sha'n't be teased. Eh, Laura ?
what do you think of it, our beauty, to see your younger sister
impertinent enough to set up a lover, while your pink cheeks
are left in the lurch ? '

<p/>Laura not being wont to make playful repartees, her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) silence
passed unnoticed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feelings were mixed ; but perhaps the
predominant one was satisfaction that it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) pink
cheeks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was valued.

<p/>It had occurred to Mrs. Edmonstone that it was a curious
tiling, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) attempt at scheming for Eveleen, to have to
announce to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that Guy was attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own daughter ; nay,
after the willingness Eveleen had manifested to be gratified with
any attention Guy showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>), it seemed doubtful for a moment
whether the intelligence would be pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>). However,
Eveleen was just the girl to like men better than women,
and never to be so happy as when on the verge of flirting;



<p/>154 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>it would probably have been the same with any other youth
that came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) way ; and Guy might fully be acquitted of doing
more than paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) the ci\dlities which were requisite from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to any young lady visitor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had, two years ago, when a
mere boy, idled, laughed, and made fun with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fear
of trifling away his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) time had made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) draw back, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
involved himself in what might have led to anything further ;
and during the present visit, no one could doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was
preoccupied with Amy. At any rate, it was right that Eveleen
should know the truth, in confidence, if only to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) from
talking of any surmises she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) might have.

<p/>Mrs, Edmonstone was set at ease in a moment. Eveleen was
enchanted, danced round and round the room, declared they
would be the most charming couple in the world ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had seen
it all along ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) was so delighted they had come to an under-
standing at last, poor things, they were so miserable all last
week ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) must take credit to herself for having done it all.
Was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) aunt very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) ?

<p/>' My dear Eva,'' exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone, into whose mind
the notion never entered that any one could boast of such a
proceeding as hers last night ; but the truth was that Eveleen,
feeling slightly culpable, was delighted that all had turned out
so well, and resolved to carry it off with a high hand.

<p/>' To be sure ! Poor little Amy ! when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked ready to
sink into the earth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) obligations to me ! Was
not it the cleverest thing in the world 1 It was just the touch
they wanted -- the very thing ! '

<p/>' My dear, I am glad I know that you are sometimes given to
talking nonsense,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, laughing.

<p/>' And you won't believe me serious ? You won't be grateful
to me for my lucky hit?'' said Eveleen, looking comically
injured. ' Oh auntie, that is very hard, when I shall believe to
my dying day that I did it ! '

<p/>' Why, Eva, if I thought it had been done by design, I should
find it very hard to forgive you for it at all, rather hard even to
accept Guy, so you had better not try to disturb my belief that
it was only that spirit of mischief that makes you now and then
a little mad.''

<p/>' Oh dear ! what a desperate scolding you must have given
poor little Charlotte ! ' exclaimed Eveleen, quaintly.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone could not help laughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) confessed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had altogether forgotten Charlotte.

<p/>' Then you will. You'll go on forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>),'' cried Eveleen.
' She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was told, and did not know the malice of
it. There, you're relenting ! There's a good aunt ! And now, if
you won't be grateful, as any other mamma in the world would
have been, and as I calculated on, when I pretended to have
been a prudent, designing woman, instead of a wild mischievous
monkey, at least you'll forgiv e me enough to invite me to the
wedding, Oh ! what a beauty of a wedding it will be 1 I'd come



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 155

<p/>from Kilcoran all the way on my bare knees to see it. And
you'll let me be bridesmaid, and have a ball after it ? '

<p/>' There is no saying what I may do, if you'll only be a good
girl, and hold your tongue. I don't want to prevent your telling
anything to your mamma, of course, but pray don't let it go
any further. Don't let Maurice hear it. I have especial reasons
for wishing it should not be known. You know it is not even
an engagement, and nothing must be done which can make
Guy feel in the least bound 1 '

<p/>Eveleen promised, and Mrs. Edmonstone knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had
sense and proper feeling enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) promise to deserve trust.

<p/>``Athen^um Terrace, St. Mildred's,
August 4th.

<p/>' My DEAR Philip, -- Thank you for returning the books, which
were brought safely by Sir Guy. I am sorry you do not agree
in my estimate of them. I should have thought your strong
sense would have made you perceive that reasoning upon fact,
and granting nothing without tangible proof, were the best
remedy for a dreamy romantic tendency to the weakness and
credulity which are in the present day termed poetry and faith.
It is curious to observe how these vague theories reduce them-
selves to the absurd when brought into practice. There are two
Miss Wellwoods here, daughters of that unfortunate man who
fell in a duel with old Sir Guy Morville, who seem to make it
their business to become the general subject of animadversion,
taking pauper children into their house, where they educate
them in a way to unlit them for their station, and teach them to
observe a sort of monastic rule, preaching the poor people in the
hospital to death, visiting the poor at all sorts of strange hours.
Dr. Henley actually found one of them, at twelve o'clock at
night, in a miserable lodging-house, filled with the worst descrip-
tion of inmates. Quite young women, too, and with no mother
or elder person to direct them ; but it is the fashion among the
attendants at the new chapel to admire them. This subject has
diverted me from what I intended to say with respect to the
young baronet. Your description agrees wifch all I have hitherto
seen, though I own I expected a RedclyfFe Morville to have
more of the heros cle roman, or rather of the grand tragic cast
of figure^ as, if I remember right, was the case with this youth's



<p/>156 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>father, a much finer and handsomer young man. Sir Guy is
certainly gentlemanlike, and has that sort of agreeability which
depends on high animal spirits. I should think him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) clever, but
superficial ; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mania for music, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) can hardly fail to
be merely an accomplished man. In spite of all you said of
the Redclyffe temper, I was hardly prepared to find it so ready
to flash forth on the most inexplicable provocations. It is like
walking on a volcano. I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) two or three times draw
himself up, bite his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip, and answer with an effort and a sharpness
that shows how thin a crust covers the burning lava ; but I
acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has been very civil and attentive, and
speaks most properly of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) owes to you. I only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
will not be hurt by the possession of so large a property so
early in life, and I have an idea that our good aunt at Holly well
has done a good deal to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opinion of himself. We shall,
of course, show him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) every civility in our power, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
the advantage of intellectual society at our house. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) letters
are directed to this place, as you know South Moor Farm is out
of the cognizance of the post. They seem to keep up a brisk
correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) from Holly well. Few guardians' letters
are, I should guess, honoured with such deepening colour as his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>)
while reading one from my uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) has been
calling at Stylehurst ; it is a pity, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) sake, that Colonel
Harewood is at home, for the society of those sons is by no
means advisable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>). I can hardly expect to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>) what
is likely to be as agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>) as the conversation and amuse-
ments of Edward and Tom Harewood, who are sure to be at
home for the St. Mildred's races. I hear Tom has been getting
into fresh scrapes at Cambridge.

<p/>' Your affectionate sister,

 (<font color='red'><b>sister Henley</b></font>)</div><p/>``Athenaeum Terrace, St. Mildred's,
Sept. 6th.

<p/>' My dear Philip, -- No one can have a greater dislike than
myself to what is called mischief -making ; therefore I leave it
entirely to you to make what use you please of the following
facts, which have fallen under my notice. Sir Guy Morville has
been several times at St. Mildred's, in company with Tom Hare-
wood, and more than once alone with some strange questionable-
looking people ; and not many days ago, my maid met him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
coming out of a house in one of the low streets, which it is
hard to assign a motive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) visiting. This, liowever, might
be accident, and I should never have thouglit of mentioning it,
but for a circumstance that occurred this mor-ning. I had occa-
sion to visit Grey's Bank, and while waiting in conversation with
Mr. Grey, a person came in whom I knew to be a notorious
gambler, and offered a cheque to be changed. As it lay on the
counter, mv eye was caught by the signature. It was my
uncle's. I looked again, and could not be mistaken. It was a



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 157

<p/>draft for #30 on Drummond, dated the 12th of August, to Sir
Guy Morville, signed C. Edmonstone, and endorsed in Sir Guy's
own writing, with the name of John White. In order that I
miglit be certain that I was doing the poor young man no injus-
tice, I outstayed the man, and asked who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, when Mr, Grey
confirmed me in my belief that it was one Jack White, a jockey-
ing sort of man who attends all the races in the country, and
makes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) livelihood by betting and gambling. And now, my
dear brother, make what use of this fact you think fit, though I
fear there is little hope of rescuing the poor youth from the
fatal habits which are hereditary in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) family, and must be
strong indeed not to have been eradicated by such careful train-
ing as you say he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has received. I leave it entirely to you,
trusting in your excellent judgment, and only hoping you will
not bring my name forward. Grieving much at having to be
the first to communicate such unpleasant tidings, which will
occasion so much vexation at Hollywell.

<p/>' Your affectionate sister,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Margaret Henley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister Henley</b></font>)</div><p/>Captain Morville was alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) received the latter of
these letters. At first, a look divided between irony and melan-
choly passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sister's preface and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
hearsay evidence, but, as lie went farther, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) upper lip curled,
and a sudden gleam, as of exultation in a verified prophecy,
lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) eye, shading off quickly, however, and giving place
to an iron expression of rigidity and sternness, the compressed
mouth, coldly-fixed eye, and sedate brow, composed into a grave
severity that might have served for an impersonation of stern
justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) looked through the letter a second time, folded it
up, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) pocket, and went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) usual affairs ; but
the expression did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) face all day ; and the next morn-
ing he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) took a day-ticket by the railway to Broadstone, where, as
it was the day of the petty sessions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had little doubt of
meeting Mr. Edmonstone. Accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had not walked far
down the High Street, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) uncle standing on the
step of the post-office, opening a letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had just received.

<p/>' Ha ! Philip, what brings you here 1 The very man I wanted.
Coming to Hollywell V

<p/>' No, thank you, I go back this evening,'' said Philip ; and, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw that the letter which Mr. Edmonstone held, and
twisted with a hasty, nervous movement, was in Guy's writing.

<p/>' Well, I am glad you are here, at any rate. Here is the most
extraordinary thing ! What possesses the boy I cannot guess.
Here's Guy writing to me for -- What do you think ? To send
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a thousand pounds ! '

<p/>' Hem ! ' said Philip in an expressive tone ; yet, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
not very much amazed ; ' no explanation, I suppose 1 '

<p/>' No, none at all. Here, see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) says yourself. No !
Yes, you may,'' added Mr. Edmonstone, with a rapid glance at



<p/>158 - THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>the end of the letter, -- a movement first to retain it, and then
following his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) first impulse, with an unintelligible murmuring.
Philip read, --

<p/>' South Moob, Sept. 7th.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. Edmonstone, -- You will be surprised at the
request I have to make you, after my resolution not to exceed
my allowance. However, this is not for my own expenses, and
it will not occur again. I should be much obliged to you to
let me have #1000, in wliat manner you please, only I should
be glad if it were soon. I am sorry I am not at liberty to tell
you what I want it for, but I trust to your kindness. Tell
Charlie I will write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) in a day or two ; but, between our
work, and walking to St. Mildred's for tlie letters, which we
cannot help doing every day, the time for writing is short.
Another month, however, and what a holiday it will be ! Tell
Amy she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought to be here to see the purple of the hills in the
early morning ; it almost makes up for having no sea. The
races have been making St. Mildred's very gay ; indeed, we laugh
at Wellwood for having brouglit us here, by way of a quiet place.
I never was in the way of so much dissipation in my life.

<p/>' Yours very affectionately,
' Guy Morville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, what do you think of it ? What would you do in my
place -- eh, Philip? What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) want of it, ehV said Mr.
Edmonstone, tormenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) riding-whip, and looking up to
study his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew's face, which, with stern gravity in every
feature, was bent over the letter, as if to weigh every line.
' Eh, Philip 1 ' repeated Mr. Edmonstone, several times, without
obtaining an answer.

<p/>' This is no place for discussion,<div class="bookquote">'' at last said Philip, delibe-
rately returning the letter. ' Come into the reading-room. We
shall find no one there at this hour. Here we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well -- well -- well,'' began Mr. Edmonstone, fretted by liis cool-
ness to the extreme of impatience, ' what do you think of it 1 He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
can't be after any mischief ; `tis not in the boy ; when -- when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
is all but Pooh ! what am I saying 1 Well, what do you think ? '

<p/>' I am afraid it confirms but too strongly a report which I
received yesterday.''

<p/>' From your sister 1 Does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) know anything about it ? '

<p/>' Yes, from my sister. But I was very unwilling to mention
it, because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) particularly requests that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name may not be
used. I came here to see whether you had heard of Guy lately,
so as to judge whether it was needful to speak of it. This con-
vinces me ; but I must beg, in the first instance, that you will
not mention her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), not even to my aunt,''

<p/>' Well, yes ; very well. I promise. Only let me hear.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Hare wood has, I fear, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) into bad company.

<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 159

<p/>uncle started up, exclaiming -- ' Gambling ! Impossible ! Some
confounded slander ! I don't believe one word of it ! I won't
hear such things said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) repeated, stammering with
passion, and walking violently about the room. This did not
last long ; there was something in the unmoved way in which
Philip waited till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had patience to listen, which gradually
mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) angry manner subsided, and, sitting down,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) continued the argument in a would-be-composed voice.

<p/>' It is utterly impossible ! Remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thinks himself bound
not so much as to touch a billiard cue.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could have thought it impossible, but for what I have seen
of the way in which promises are eluded by persons too strictly
bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip. ' The moral force of principle is the only
efficient pledge.''

<p/>' Principle ! I should like to see who has better principles than
Guy ! ' cried Mr. Edmonstone. ' You have said so yourself, fifty
times, and your aunt has said so, and Charles. I could as soon
suspect myself.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was growing vehement, but again Philip's
imperturbability repressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) violence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Well,
what evidence have you? Mind, I am not going to believe it
without the strongest. I don't know that I would believe my
own eyes against him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is very sad to find such confidence misplaced,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip.
' Most sincerely do I wish this could be proved to be a mistake ;
but this extraordinary request corroborates my sister's letter
too fully.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Let me hear,'' said Mr. Edmonstone feebly.

<p/>Philip produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letter, without reading the whole of it ;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear the appearance of gossip and prying, and
would not expose his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pieced it out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own
words, and made it sound far less discreditable to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). It was
quite enough for Mr. Edmonstone ; the accuracy of the details
seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) dumb ; and there was a long silence, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) broke by saying, with a deep sigh, --

<p/>' Who could have thought it ? Poor little Amy ! '

<p/>' Amy 1 ' exclaimed Philip.

<p/>' Why, ay. I did not mean to have said anything of it, I am
sure ; but they did it among them,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone, grow-
ing ashamed, under Philip's eye, as of a dreadful piece of
imprudence. ' I was out of the way at the time, but I could not
refuse my consent, you know, as things stood then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you mean to say that Amy is engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Why, no -- not exactly engaged, only on trial, you understand,
to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will be steady. I was at Broadstone ; 'twas mamma
settled it all. Poor little thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is very much in love with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), I do believe ; but there's an end of everything now.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very fortunate this has been discovered in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said
Philip. <div class="bookquote">``Instead of pitying her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I should rejoice in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) escape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Edmonstone, ruefully. <div class="bookquote">``Who could have

<p/>160 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I am afraid the mischief is of long standing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>proceeded Philip,
resolved, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle so grieved, to press him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) strongly,
thinking that to save Amy from such a marriage was an addi-
tional motive. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could hardly have arrived at losing as much
as a thousand pounds, all at once, in this month at St, Mildred's.
Depend upon it, that jDainful as it may be at present, there is
great reason, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) account, to rejoice in the discovery. You
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has never before applied to you for money ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a farthing beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) allowance, except this unlucky
thirty pounds, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) additional expense of the tutor and the
lodging.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' You remember, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has always seemed short of
money, never appeared able to afford himself any little extra
expense. You have noticed it, I know. You remember, too,
how unsatisfactory his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) reserve about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) proceedings in London
has been, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has persisted in delaying there, in spite of
all warnings. The work, no doubt, began there, under the
guidance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle ; and now the St. Mildred's races and Tom
Hare wood have continued it.''

<p/>' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) had never set foot in the place ! '

<p/>' Nay ; for Amy's sake, the exposure is an advantage, if not for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) own. The course must have been long since begun ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
contrived to avoid what could lead to inquiry, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) has at
length involved himself in some desperate scrape. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)
especially desires to have the money soon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) never even
attempts to say you would approve of the object.''

<p/>' Yes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) has the grace not to say that.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Altogether, it is worse than I could have thought possible,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip. ' I could have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) unstable and thought-
less ; but the concealment, and the attempting to gain poor
Amy's affections in the midst of such a course '

<p/>' Ay, ay ! ' cried Mr. Edmonstone, now fully provoked ; ' there
is the monstrous part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought I was going to give up my
poor little girl to a gambler, did he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) 1 but he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) shall soon see what
I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>), -- riches, Redclyffe, title, and all ! '

<p/>' I knew that would be your feeling.''

<p/>' Feel ! Yes ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gambler</b></font>) shall feel it, too. So, Sir Guy, you
thought you had an old fool of a guardian, did you, whom you
could blind as you pleased ? but you shall soon see the difference ! '

<p/>' Better begin cautiously,<div class="bookquote">'' suggested Philip. ' Remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
unfortunate temper, and write coolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Coolly ? You may talk of coolness ; but `tis enough to make
one's blood boil to be served in such a way. With the face to
be sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) messages in the very same letter ! That is a pass
beyond me, to stand coolly to see my daughter so treated.''

<p/>' I would only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the opportunity of saying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) can
for himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may have some explanation.''

and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) so before I'm a day older ; nay, before I stir from
this room. My little Amy, indeed ! '

<p/>Philip put no obstacles in the way of this proposal, for lie
knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle's displeasure, though hot at first, was apt to
evaporate in exclamations ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought it likely that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
good nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) partiality for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dislike to causing
pain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) daughter, and, above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wife's blind confidence in
Guy, would, when once at home, so overpower his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) present indig-
nation as to prevent the salutary strictness which was the only
hope of reclaiming Guy. Beside, a letter written under Philip's
inspection was likely to be more guarded, as well as more forcible,
than an unassisted composition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own, as was, indeed, pretty
well proved by the commencement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) first attempt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Guy, -- I am more surprised than I could have
expected at your application.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip read this aloud, so as to mark its absurdity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
began again.

<p/>' I am greatly astonished, as well as concerned, at your appli-
cation, which confirms the unpleasant reports '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why say anything of reports?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Philip. <div class="bookquote">``Reports are
nothing. A man is not forced to defend himself from reports.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, -- hum -- ha, -- the accounts I have received. No. You
say there is not to be a word of Mrs. Henley.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not a word that can lead her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to be suspected.''

<p/>' Confirms-- confirms -- ' sighed Mr. Edmonstone.

<p/>' Don't write as if you went on hearsay evidence. Speak of
proofs -- irrefragable proofs -- and then you convict him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) at once,
without power of eluding you.''

<p/>So Mr. Edmonstone proceeded to write, that the application
confirmed the irrefragable proofs ; then laughed at himself, and
helplessly begged Philip to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a start. It now stood
thus : --

<p/>' Your letter of this morning has caused me more concern than
surprise, as it unhappily only adds confirmation to the intelli-
gence already in my possession ; that either from want of
resolution to withstand the seductions of designing persons, or
by the impetuosity and instability of your own character, you
have been led into the ruinous and degrading practice of gam-
bling ; and that from hence proceed the diflGlculties that occasion
your application to me for money. I am deeply grieved at thus
finding that neither the principles which have hitherto seemed
to guide you, nor the pledges which you used to hold sacred, nor,
I may add, the feelings you have so recently expressed towards
a member of my family, have been sufiicient to preserve you
from yielding to a temptation which could never be presented
to the mind of any one whose time was properly occupied in the
business of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) education.''

<p/>' Is that all I am to say about her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>),'' exclaimed Mr. Edmonstone,
' after the atrocious way the fellow has treated her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in ? '

<p/>M



<p/>162 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' Since it is, happily, no engagement, I cannot see how you can,
with propriety, assume that it is one, l3y speaking of breaking it
off. Besides, give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) no ground for complaint, or he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will take
refuge in believing himself ill-used. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) if lie can disprove
it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cannot, it will be time enough to act further.
But wait -- wait, sir,<div class="bookquote">'' as the pen was moving over the paper,
impatient to dash forward. ' You liave not told him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) yet of what
you accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip meditated a few moments, then produced another
sentence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no means of judging how long you have been follow-
ing this unhappy course ; I had rather believe it is of recent
adoption, but I do not know how to reconcile this idea with the
magnitude of your demand, unless your downward progress has
been more rapid than usual in such beginnings. It would, I fear,
be quite vain for me to urge upon you all the arguments and
reasons that ought to have been present to your mind, and
prevented you from taking the first fatal step. I can only entreat
you to pause, and consider the ruin and degradation to which
this hateful vice almost invariably conducts its victims, and
consistently with my duty as your guardian, everything in my
power shall be done to extricate you from the embarrassments in
which you have involved yourself. But, in the first place, I make
it a point that you treat me with perfect confidence, and make a
full, unequivocal statement of your proceedings ; above all, that
you explain the circumstances occasioning your request for this
large sum. Remember, I say, complete candour on your part
will afford the only means of rescuing you from difficulties, or of
in any degree restoring you to my good opinion,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>So far the letter had proceeded slowly, for Philip was careful
and deliberate in composition ; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
words, Mr. Edmonstone rushed on with something unfit to stand,
so as to have to begin over again. At last, the town clock struck
five ; Philip started, declaring that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was not at the station
in five minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should lose the train ; engaged to come to
Hollywell on the day an answer might be expected, and hastened
away, satisfied by having seen two sheets nearly filled, and having
said there was nothing more but to sign, seal, and send it.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone had, however, a page of note-paper more, and
it was with a sensation of relief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wrote, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish, from the bottom of my heart, that you could clear-
yourself. If a dozen men had sworn it till they were black in
the face, I would not have believed it of you that you could
serve us in such a manner, after the way you have been treated
at home, and to dare to think of my daughter with such things
on your mind. I could never have believed it, but for the proofs
Philip has brought ; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is as sorry as myself.
Only tell the whole truth, and I will do my best to get you out
of the scrape. Though all else must be at an end between us, I
am your guardian still, and I will not be harsh with you.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 163

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) posted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) letter, climbed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tall horse, and rode home,
rather heavy-hearted ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wrath burning out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) left
Broadstone Ijeliind him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little Amy gay and lively,
and could not bear to sadden her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) persuaded himself that
there was no need to mention the suspicions till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had heard
what Guy had to say for himself. Accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) told no one
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), who thought Guy as unlikely to gamble
as Amy herself, had not the least doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would be able to
clear himself, and agreed that it was much better to keep silence
for the present.

<p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate.
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance.

<p/>Merchant op Venice

<p/>St. Mildred's was a fashionable summer resort, which the
virtues of a mineral spring, and the reputation of Dr. Henley,
had contributed to raise to a high degree of prosperity. It stood at
the foot of a magnificent range of beautifully formed hills, where
the crescents and villas, white and smart, showed their own insig-
nificance beneath the purple peaks that rose high above them.

<p/>About ten miles distant, across the hills, was Stylehurst, the
parish of the late Archdeacon Morville, and the native place of
Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister Margaret. It was an extensive parish, in-
cluding a wide tract of the hilly country ; and in a farm-house in
the midst of the moorland, midway between St. Mildred's and
the village of Stylehurst, had Mr. Wellwood fixed himself with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) three pupils.

<p/>Guy's first visit was of course to Mrs. Henley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) side, prepared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother to patronize him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as Philip would
have done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) place. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) patronage was valuable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) own
circle ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) connections were good ; the Archdeacon's name was
greatly respected ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had a handsome and well-regulated esta-
blishment, and this, together with talents which, having no family,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had cultivated more than most women have time to do, made
lier a person of considerable distinction at St. Mildred's. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>)
was, in fact, the leading lady of the place -- the manager of the
book-club, in the chair at all the charitable committees, and the
principal person in society, giving literary parties, with a degree
of exclusiveness that made admission to them a privilege.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) was a very fine woman, handsomer at two-and-thirty than
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) early bloom ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) height little less than that of lier tall
brother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) manner and air had something very distinguished.
The first time Guy saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was strongly reminded both of
Philip and of Mrs. Edmonstone, but not pleasingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) seemed
to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) aunt, without the softness and motherly affection,
coupled with the touch of naivete that gave Mrs. Edmonstone
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) freshness and loveableness ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) likeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) brother



<p/>164 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>included that decided, self-reliant air, which became him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) well
enough, but which did not sit as appropriately on a woman.

<p/>Guy soon discovered another resemblance-- for the old unac-
countable impatience of Philip's conversation, and reliet m
escaping from it, haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been ^ quarter of
an hou? in Mrs. Henley's drawing-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) asked after the
Hollvwell party : she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) cousins since her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) marriage,
and happily for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings, passed over Laura and Amy as if
they were nonentities ; but they were all too near his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)^ heart for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to be able with patience to hear `poor Charles s temper
regretted, and still less the half-sarcastic, half-compassionate tone
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) implied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) aunt spoilt hmi dreadfully, and
showed how cheap she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) held both Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone

<p/>Two vears ago, Guy could not have kept down his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) irritation ;
but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was master of himself sufficiently to give a calm
courteous reply, so conveying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own respect for them, that
Mrs. Henley was almost disconcerted ,,,.,, i ^ir

<p/>Stylehurst had great interest for Guy both for the sake ot
Archdeacon Morville's kindness, and as tlie home which Philip
regarded with affection, that seemed the one softening touch in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) character. So Guy visited the handsome church, studied the
grave-yard, and gathered the traditions of the place from the old
texton:^s wife, who rejoiced in finding aii auditor for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) long
stories of the good Archdeacon, Miss Fanny, and Mr Fhil p
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, saying times were changed, and Miss
Morville that was, never came neist the place. ,

<p/>The squire, Colonel Harewood, was an old friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>) grand-
father's, and therefore was to be called on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>) had never been
wise, and had been dissipated chiefly from vacancy of mmd he (<font color='blue'><b>Harewood</b></font>)
was now growing old, and led a quieter life, and though Guy did
not find him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a very entertaining companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) civi-
lities readily, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather's sake. ^ AVhen Ins sons came
liome, Guy recognized in them the description of men he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
wont to shun at Oxford, as much from distaste as from principle ;
but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not absolutely avoid them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw little of them,
being very busy, and having pleasant companions m his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fellow
pupits. It was a very mer?y party at South Moor, and Guy s
high spirits made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the life of everything. ,

<p/>The first time Mr. Wellwood went to call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) cousins at bt.
Mildred's, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the
hand of old Sir Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began repeating, for th^^wentieth time
what an excellent fellow Morville was ; then said he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) should not
have troubled them with any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) pupils, but Morville would
esteem their receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) as an act of forgiveness and besides
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) wished them to know one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) valued so highly. W
thus found himself admitted into an entirely new region, ihere
were two sisters, together in everything. Jane, the younger,
was a kind-hearted, commonplace person, who would never have
looked beyond the ordinary range of duties and charities ; but
Elizabeth was one of those who rise up, from time to time, as



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 165

<p/>burning and shining lights. It was not spending a quiet, easy-
life, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) charities secondary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) comforts, but devoting
time, strength, and goods ; not merely giving away what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could spare, but actually sharing all with the poor, reserving
nothing for the future. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) not only tauglit the young, and
visited the distressed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gathered orphans into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) house,
and nursed the sick day and night. Neitlier the means nor the
strength of the two sisters could ever have been supposed equal
to what they were known to have achieved. It seemed as if the
power grew with the occasion, and as if they had some help which
could not fail them. Guy venerated them more and more, and
many a long letter about them was written to Mrs. Edmonstone
for Amy to read. There is certainly a ' tyrannous hate ' in the
world for unusual goodness, which is a rebuke to it, and there was
a strong party against the sisters. At the head of it was Mrs.
Henley, who had originally been displeased at their preferring
the direction of the clergyman to that of the ladies' committee,
though the secret cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) dislike was, perliaps, that Elizabeth
Well wood was just what Margaret Morville might have been.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) blamed them, not, indeed for their charity, but for slight
peculiarities which might well have been lost in the brightness of
the works of mercy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) spoke as with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) father's authority,
though, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been differently disposed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) might have
remembered that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) system and principles were the same as
theirs, and that, had he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) been alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would probably have fully
approved of their proceedings. Archdeacon Morville's name was
of great weight, and justified many persons, in their own opinion,
in the opposition made to Miss Wellwood, imjDeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) useful-
ness, and subjecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) to endless petty calumnies.

<p/>These made Guy very angry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew enough of the Arch-
deacon through Mrs. Edmonstone, and the opinions held by Philip,
to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) daughter was ascribing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had never
held ; but, be that as it might, Guy could not bear to hear good
evil spoken of, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) indignation was stirred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heard these
spiteful reports uttered by people who sat at home at ease, against
one whose daily life was only too exalted for their imitation.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brow contracted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eye kindled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip was bitten, and now
and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) trusted himself to reply, it was with a keen,
sharp power of rebuke that made people look round, astonished
to hear such forcible words from one so young. Mrs. Henley was
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), without knowing it ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was sparing
the Morville temper when she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) avoided the subject, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
stood in awe of no one else, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
accordingly.

<p/>One evening Guy had been dining at Dr. Henley's, and was
setting out, enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) escape from ^Irs. Henley and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) friends,
and rejoicing in the prospect of a five miles' walk over the hills by
moonlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had only gone the length of two streets, when
lie saw a dark figure at a little distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and a voice
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had little expected to hear, called out, --



<p/>166 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' Sir Guy himself ! No one else could whistle that Swedish air
so correctly ! '

<p/>' My uncle ! ' exclaimed Guy. ' I did not know that you were
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER XV Antonio</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dixon laughed, said something about a fortunate rencontre,
and began an account about a concert somewhere or other, mixed
up with something about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wife and child, all so rambling and
confused, that Guy, beginning to suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been drinking,
was only anxious to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lodged, and
talked of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) soon found,
however, that this had not been the case, at least not to any great
extent. Dixon was only nervous and excited, either about some-
thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had done, or some request he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had to make, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) went
on walking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) nephew's side, talking in a strange, desultory
way of open, generous-hearted fellows overlooking a little indis-
cretion, and of Guy's riches, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed to think inex-
haustible.

<p/>' If there is anything that you want me to do for you, tell me
plainly what it is,'' said Guy, at last.

<p/>Mr. Dixon began to overwhelm him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with thanks, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cut
them short. ' I promise nothing. Let me hear Avhat you want,
and I can judge whether I can do it.''^

<p/>Sebastian broke out into exclamations at the words ' if I can,''
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) thought everything in the power of the heir of HedclyfFe.

<p/>' Have I not told you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' that for the present I have
very little command of money ? Hush ! no more of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
added, sternly, cutting off an imprecation which his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle was
commencing on those who kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so short.

<p/>' And you are content to bear it ? Did you never hear of Avays
and means ? If you were to say but one word of borrowing, they
would go down on their knees to you, and offer you every
farthing you have to keep you in their own hands.''

<p/>*I am quite satisfied,'' said Guy, coldly.

<p/>' The greater fool are you ! ' was on Dixon's lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did
not utter it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wanted to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) ; and after some
more circumlocution, Guy succeeded in discovering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liad
been gambling, and had lost an amount which, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
obtain immediate assistance, would become known, and lead to
the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) character and situation. Guy stood and considered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had an impulse, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not think it a safe one, and
resolved to give himself time.

<p/>' I do not say that I cannot help you,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered ; ' but
I must have time to consider.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Time ! would you see me ruined while you are considering 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose this must be paid immediately. Where do you
lodge?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>^

<p/>Mr. Dixon told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) the street and number.

<p/>``You shall liear from me to-morrow morning. I cannot
trust my present thouglits. Good night ! '

<p/>Mr. Dixon would fain have guessed whether the present



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 167

<p/>thoughts were favourable, but all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) extremity was
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) nephew ; it might be fatal to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) too far, and, with
a certain trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) good-nature, Sebastian allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to walk
away without further remonstrance.

<p/>Guy knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own impetuous nature too well to venture to
act on impluse in a doubtful case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had now first to consider
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was able to do, and secondly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would do ; and
this was not as clear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind as in the earlier days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
acquaintance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>Their intercourse had never been on a comfortable footing.
It would perhaps have been better if Philip's advice had been
followed, and no connection kept up. Guy had once begged for
some definite rule, since there was always vexation when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
known to have been with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, and yet Mr. Edmonstone
would never absolutely say he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ought not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). As long
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) guardian permitted it, or rather winked at it, Guy did not
think it necessary to attend to Philip's marked disapproval.
Part of it was well founded, but part was dislike to all that might
be considered as vulgar, and part was absolute injustice to Sebas-
tian Dixon ; there was everything that could offend in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) line of
argument, and in the very circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) interfering ; and
Guy had a continual struggle, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was not always success-
ful, to avoid showing the affront he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had taken, and to reason
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) subsequent indignation. The ever-recurring irritation
which Philip's conversation was apt to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
avoid it as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could, and retreat in haste from the subjects
on which they were most apt to disagree, and so his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) manner had
assumed an air of reserve, and almost of distrust, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin,
that was very unlike its usual winning openness.

<p/>This had been one unfortunate effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) intercourse with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle, and another was a certain vague, dissatisfied feeling
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) silence, and Philip's insinuations respecting the days
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spent in London, left on Mr. Edmonstone's mind, and which
gained strength from their recurrence. The days were, indeed,
not many ; it was only that in coming from and going to Oxford,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) slept a night at an hotel in London -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) uncle never would
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) lodgings, never even would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) where they
were, but always gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) address at the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) engagement-RRB-,
was conducted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to some concert in the evening, and had
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to breakfast in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not think there was
any harm in this ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) explained all he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had done to Mr. Edmon-
stone the first time, but nothing was gained by it : his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) visits to
London continued to be treated as something to be excused or
overlooked -- as something not quite correct.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would almost have been ready to discontinue them, but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw tliat his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) uncle regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) with affection, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
could not bear the thought of giving up a poor relation for the
sake of the opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) rich friends. These meetings were the
one pure pleasure to which Sebastian looked, recalling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>)
the happier days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) youth, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) friendship with Guy s

<p/>father ; and when Guy perceived how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) valued them, it would
have seemed a piece of cruel neglect to gratify himself by giving
the time to Hollywell.

<p/>Early in the course of their acquaintance, the importunity
of a creditor revealed that, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) handsome salary,
Sebastian Dixon was often in considerable distress for money.
In process of time, Guy discovered that at the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle had
been supporting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband in all the luxury he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thought befitted their rank, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had contracted considerable debts,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had only been able to return to England on condition of
paying so much a-year to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) creditors. This left him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) very little
on which to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family ; but still his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pride made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
bent on concealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) difficulties, and it was not without
a struggle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would at first consent to receive assistance
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) nephew.

<p/>Guy resolved that these debts, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) considered as in fact
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father's own, should be paid as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had the command
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) property ; but, in the meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought himself bound
to send his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle all the help in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) power, and when once the
effort of accepting it at all was over, Dixon's expectations ex-
tended far* beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) power. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) allowance was not large, and
the constant requests for a few pounds to meet some pressing
occasion were more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) could well meet. They kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
actually a great deal poorer than men without a tenth part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
fortune, and at the end of the term he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) would look loack with
surprise at having been able to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) way ; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) con-
trived neither to exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) allowance, nor to get into debt. This
was, indeed, only done by a rigid self-denial of little luxuries
such as most young men look on nearly as necessaries ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
had never been brought up to think self-indulgence a consequence
of riches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did not care what was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had no
expensive tastes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did not seek after society, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was
not ill-prepared for such a course, and only thought of it as an
assistance in abstaining from the time-wasting that might have
tempted him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had had plenty of money to spend.

<p/>The only thing that concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was a growing doubt lest
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) might be feeding extravagance instead of doing good ; and
the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) disliked himself for the suspicion, the more it would
return. There was no doubt much distress ; the children were
sickly ; several of them died ; the doctor's bills, and other ex-
penses, pressed heavily, and Guy blamed himself for having
doubted. Yet, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not conceal from himself traces
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle was careless and imprudent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had once, indeed,
in a violent fit of self-reproach, confessed as much, allowed that
what ought to have been spent in the maintenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family,
had gone in gambling, but immediately after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been seized
with a fit of terror, and implored Guy to guard the secret, since,
if once it came to the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) creditors, it would be all
over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>Concealment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) present difiiculties was therefore no less



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 169

<p/>necessary than assistance in paying the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) owed. Indeed,
as far as Guy was able to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confused statement,
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wanted was at once to pay a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) debt, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could go on to a place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was engaged to perform, and
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would earn enough to make up the rest.

<p/>Guy had intended to have sent for Deloraine, but had since
given up the idea, in order to be able to help forward some plans
of Miss Wellwood's, and resigning this project would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
to place thirty pounds at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle's disposal, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) just
enough to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) expenses at South Moor, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) back
to Hollywell. It was sorely against his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) inclination that, instead
of helping a charity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) savings should go to pay gaming debts,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) five-miles' walk was spent in self -debate on the right and
wrong of the matter, and questions what should be done for the
future -- for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was beginning to awaken to the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
responsibility, and feared lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might be encouraging vice.

<p/>Very early next morning Guy put his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor's
room, announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must walk into St. Mildred's on busi-
ness, but should be back by eleven at the latest, ran down-stairs,
called Bustle, and made interest with the farmer's wife for a
hunch of dry bread and a cup of new milk.

<p/>Then rejoicing that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mind, though not
light-hearted enough to whistle, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) walked across the moorland,
through the white morning mist, curling on the sides of the hills
in fantastic forms, and now and then catching his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lengthened
shadow, so as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) smile by reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) of the spectre
of the Brocken.

<p/>Not without difficulty, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) found a back street, and a little
shop, where a slovenly maid was sweeping the steps, and the
shutters were not yet taken down. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) asked if Mr. Dixon
lodged there. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman said, staring in amazement
that such a gentleman could be there at that time in the morn-
ing, asking for Mr. Dixon.

<p/>' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) at home 1 '

<p/>' Yes, sir ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is not up yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was very late last night.
Did you want to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) 1 I'll tell Mrs. Dixon.''

<p/>' Is Mrs. Dixon here ? Then tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) Sir Guy Morville would
be glad to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).''

<p/>The maid curtseyed, hurried off, and returned with a message
from Mrs. Dixon to desire he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would walk in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) conducted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) through a dark passage, and up a still darker stair, into
a dingy little parlour, with a carpet of red and green stripes,
a horsehair sofa, a grate covered with cut paper, and a general
perfume of brandy and cigars. There were some preparations
for breakfast, but no one was in the room but a little girl, about
seven years old, dressed in shabby-genteel mourning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pale and sickly-looking, but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were of a lovely
deep blue, with a very sweet expression, and a profusion of thick
flaxen curls hung round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and shoulders. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, in
a soft, little, shy voice,--



<p/>170 THE HEIK OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>' Mamma says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be here directly, if you will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
a moment.''

<p/>Having made this formal speech, the little thing was creeping
off on tip-toe, so as to escape before the maid shut the door, but
Guy held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, sat down so as to be on a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>),
and said, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't go, my little maid. Won't you come and speak to
your cousin Guy 1 '

<p/>Children never failed to be attracted, whether by the winning
beauty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) smile, or the sweetness of the voice in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
spoke to anything small or weak, and the little girl willingly
came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thick,
silky curls, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name.

<p/>' Marianne,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) answered.

<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother's name, and this little creature had more
resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tenderly-cherished vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) young mother
than any description Dixon could have given. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), took the other small, cold hand, and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked St. Mildred's.

<p/>' Oh ! much better than London. There are flowers ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
proudly exhibited a cup holding some ragged robins, dead nettles,
and other common flowers, which a country child would have held
cheap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) admired and gained more of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) confidence, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had begun to chatter away quite freely about ' the high, high
hills that reached up to the sky, and the pretty stones,'' till the
door opened, and Mrs. Dixon and Bustle made their entrance.

<p/>Marianne was so much afraid of the dog, Guy so eager to con-
sole, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and protest that it should not
be turned out, that tliere was nothing but confusion, until Guy
had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) that Bustle was no dangerous wild beast, induced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) offered paw, and lay a timid finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
smooth, black head, after which the transition was short to dog
and child sitting lovingly together on the floor, Marianne strok-
ing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) ears, and admiring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) with a sort of silent ecstasy.

<p/>Mrs. Dixon was a great, coarse, vulgar woman, and Guy per-
ceived why his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle had been so averse to taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
home, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must have felt the contrast between such
a wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beautiful sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a sort of broad sense,
and absence of pretension, but her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) manner of talking was by
no means pleasant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) querulously accused her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband of
being the cause of all their misfortunes, not even restrained by
the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cliild from entering into a full account of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) offences.

<p/>Mrs. Dixon said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) should not say a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) should not
care if it was not for the cliild, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wronged
by lier own father, and not complain ; poor little dear ! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was
tlie last, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) supposed slie should not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) long.

<p/>It then appeared tliat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) husband's obtaining an engage-
ment for a series of concerts at the chief county town, Mrs.
Dixon had insisted on coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) to St. Mildred's in the



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 171

<p/>hope that country air might benefit Marianne, who, in a confined
lodging in London, was pining and dwindling as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brothers
and sisters had done before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Sebastian, who liked to escape
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) wife's grumbling and rigid supervision, and looked for-
ward to amusement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) own way at the races, had grudgingly
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to conie, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) described it, had been reluctant
to go to even so slight an exj-RRB-ense in the hope of saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) child's
life. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) as closely as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) escape, and the consequences Guy already knew.

<p/>If anything could have made it worse, it was finding that
after parting last niglit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had returned, tried to retrieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
luck, had involved himself further, had been drinking more ;
and at the very hour when his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) nephew was getting up to see
what could be done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), had come home in a state, which
made it by no means likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would be presentable, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
wife called him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) offered to do.

<p/>Guy much preferred arranging with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) what was to be done on
the present emergency. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was disappointed at finding thirty
pounds was all the help he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could give ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was an energetic
woman, full of resources, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way, with this assistance,
through the present difficulty. The great point was to keep the
gambling propensities out of sight of the creditors ; and as long
as this was done, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had hope. Dixon would go the next morn-
ing to the town where the musical meeting was to be held, and
there he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) would be with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) employers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had a character
to preserve, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in no fear of another outbreak.

<p/>It ended, therefore, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) leaving witli her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Mr. Edmonstone's
draft, securing its destination by endorsing it to the person who
was to receive it ; and Avishing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good morning, after a few
more kind words to little Marianne, who had sat playing with ■
Bustle all the time, sidling continually nearer and nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
new cousin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes bent down, and no expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face
which could enable him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to guess how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) listened to or com-
prehended the conversation so unfit for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ear. When he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) rose
to go, and stooped to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looked wistfully in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) face,
and held up a small sparkling bit of spar, the most precious of
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hoards, gleaned from the roadsides of St. Mildred's.

<p/>' What, child, do you want to give it to Sir Guy 1 ' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>)
mother. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) does not want such trumpery, my dear, though
you make such a work with it.''

<p/>' Did you mean to give it to me, my dear ? ' said Guy, as the
child hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) head, and, crimsoned with blushes, could scarcely
whisper her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) timid ' Yes.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) praised it, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, and
promised he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would always keep it ; and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) again, and
left lier a happy child, confident in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) promise of always keep-
ing it, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) mother augured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would throw it over
the next hedge.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was at South Moor by eleven o'clock, in time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
morning's business, and made up for the troubles of the last



<p/>172 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>few hours by a long talk with Mr. Well wood in the afternoon,
while the other two pupils were gone to the races, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
was not inclined, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) two ten-mile walks.

<p/>The conversation was chiefly on Church prospects in general,
and in particular on Miss Wellwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) plans ; how they
had by degrees enlarged and developed as the sin, and misery,
and ignorance around had forced themselves more plainly on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) notice, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) means liad increased and grown under her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>)
hand in the very distribution. Other schemes were dawning on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) mind, of which the foremost was the foundation of a sort
of school and hospital united, under the charge of herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>)
sister, and several other ladies, who were desirous of joining
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), as a sisterhood. But at present it was hoping against
hope, for there were no funds with which to make a commence-
ment. All this was told at unawares, drawn forth by different
questions and remarks, till Guy inquired liow much ' it would
take to give them a start 1 '

<p/>' It is impossible to say. Anything, I suppose, between one
thousand and twenty. But, by the bye, this design of Elizabetli's
is an absolute secret. If you had not almost guessed it, I sliould
never have said one word to you about it. You are a particu-
larly dangerous man, with your connection with Mrs. Henley.
You must take special good care nothing of it reaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>).''

<p/>Guy's first impression was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the last person to
mention it to Mrs. Henley ; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) remembered liow
often her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother was at Hollywell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perceived that there
might be a train for carrying the report back again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), and
recognized the absolute necessity of silence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said nothing at the time, but a bright scheme came into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head, resulting in the request for a thousand pounds, which
caused so much astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought liimself rather
shabby to have named no more, and was afraid it was an
offering that cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) notliing ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) much enjoyed devising
beforehand the letter with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would place the money at
the disposal of Miss Wellwood's hospital.

<p/>Yet burns the sun on high beyond the cloud ;

<p/>On the afternoon on which Guy expected an answer from Mr,
Edmonstone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fellow pupil, Harry Graliam,
to see if there were any letters from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at Dr. Henley's.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 173

<p/>The servant said Mrs. Henley was at home, and asked them
to come in and take their letters. These were lying on a marble
table, in the hall ; and while the man looked in the drawing-
room for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress, and sent one of the maids up-stairs in
quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), Guy hastily took up one, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) address, in
tlie well-known hand of Mr. Edmonstone.

<p/>Young Graham, wlio had taken up a newspaper, was startled
by Guy's loud, sudden exclamation, --

<p/>' Ha ! What on eartli does this mean ? '

<p/>And looking up, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face of a burning, glowing red, the
features almost convulsed, the large veins in tlie forehead and
temples swollen with the blood that rushed through them ; and
if ever his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes flashed with the dark lightning of Sir Hugh's,
it was then.

<p/>' Morville ! What's tlie matter ? '

<p/>' Intolerable ! -- insulting ! Me ? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) mean 1 ' con-
tinued Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) passion kindling more and more. ' Proofs ? I
should like to see them ! The man is crazy ! I to confess !
Ha ! ' as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came towards the end, ' I see it, -- I see it. It is
Philip, is it, that I have to thank. Meddling coxcomb ! I'll
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) repent it,<div class="bookquote">'' added he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), with a grim fierceness of deter-
mination. ' Slandering me to them ! And that,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-- looking at
the words with regard to Amy, -- ' that passes all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shall see
what it is to insult me ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it? Your guardian out of humour'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?'' asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
companion.

<p/>' My guardian is a mere weak fool. I don't blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
can't help it ; but to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made a tool of ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) twists him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
round his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) finger, abuses his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) weakness to insult -- to accuse. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shall give me an account ! '

<p/>Guy's voice had grown lower and more husky ; but though the
sound sunk, the force of passion rather increased than diminished ;
it was like the low distant sweep of the tempest as it whirls
away, preparing to return with yet more tremendous might. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
colour, too, had faded to paleness, but the veins were still swollen,
purple, and throbbing ; and there was a stillness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wrath more than fierce, intense, almost appalling,

<p/>Harry Graham was dumb with astonishment ; but while Guy
spoke, Mrs. Henley had come down, and was standing before
them, beginning a greeting. The blood rushed back into Guy's
cheeks, and, controlling his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice with powerful effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had an insulting -- an unpleasant letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added,
catching himself up. ' You must excuse me ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>' What has happened ? ' exclaimed Mrs. Henley, though, from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother's letter, as well as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) observations during a
long and purposely slow progress, along a railed gallery over-
hanging the hall, and down a winding staircase, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) knew pretty
well the whole history of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry Graham/Graham</b></font>)</div>said young Graham. <div class="bookquote">``Some absurd person

properly bad. I never saw a man in such a rage. I think I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``You don't think/ said Mrs. Henley, detaining him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Morville? His (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) guardian must have a sharp eye for

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! `thought Mrs. Henley, `these young men always hang
together;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) escape without further question.
But when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) emerged from the house, Guy was already out of
sight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not succeed in finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>Guy had burst out of the house, feeling as if nothing could
relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) but free air and rapid motion ; and on he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liurried,
fast, faster, conscious alone of the wild, furious tumult of rage
and indignation against the maligner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) innocence, who was
knowingly ruining him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with all that was dearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), insult-
ing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) by reproaches on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) breaking a most sacred, unblemished
word, and, what Guy felt scarcely less keenly, forcing kind-
hearted Mr. Edmonstone into a persecution so foreign to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
nature. The agony of sufiering such an accusation, and from
such a quarter, -- the \dolent storm of indignation and pride, --
wild, undefined ideas of a heavy reckoning, -- above all, the dreary
thought of Amy denied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for ever, -- all these swept over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and swayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) by turns, with the dreadful intensity be-
longing to a nature formed for violent jDassions, which had broken
down, in the sudden shock, all the barriers imposed on them by
a long course of self-restraint.

<p/>On he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rushed, reckless whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did ;
driven forward by the wild impulse of passion, far over moor and
hill, up and down, till at last, exhausted at once by the tumult
within, and by the violent bodily exertion, a stillness -- a sus-

<p/>-LCB- tension of thouglit and sensation -- ensued ; and when this passed,
le found himself seated on a rock which crowned the summit of
one of the hills, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) handkerchief loosened, liis waistcoat open,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hat thrown off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) temples burning and throbbing with a
feeling of distraction, and the agitated beatings of liis heart
almost stifling his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) panting breath.

<p/>' Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) muttered to himself, ' a heavy account shall lie pay
me for this crowning stroke of a long course of slander and ill-
will ! Have I not seen it ? Has not he (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) hated me from tlie

<p/>THE HEIR OF llEDCLYFFE 175

<p/>Guy uttered this last with teeth clenched, in an excess of deep,
vengeful ire. Never had Morville of the whole line felt more
deadly fierceness than held sway over him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) contemplated
Jiis revenge, looked forward with a dii-e complacency to the
punislnnent lie would wreak, not for this offence alone, but for a
long course of enmity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sat, absorbed in the plan of vengeance,
perfectly still, for liis physical exhaustion was complete ; but as
the pulsations of liis heart grew less wild, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) purpose became
sterner and more fixed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) devised its execution, planned his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
sudden journey, saw himself bursting on Philip early next morn-
ing, summoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) falsehoods. The impulse
to action seemed to restore his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) senses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked
round, to see where he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands.

<p/>Tlie sun was setting opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), in a flood of gold, -- a ruddy
ball, surrounded with its pomp of clouds, on the dazzling sweep
of horizon. That sight recalled him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not only to himself, but to
liis true and better self ; the good angel so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) for the
twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) life, had been driven aloof but for a moment,
and now, either that, or a still higher and holier power, made the
setting sun bring to his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) mind, almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ear, the words, --

<p/>Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,
Neither give place to the devil.

<p/>Guy had what some would call a vivid imagination, others a
lively faith. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) shuddered ; then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knees, and
liis hands clasped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat, bending forward, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes closed, wrought up in a fearful struggle ; while it was
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw the hereditary demon of the Morvilles
watching by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) side, to take full possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as a rightful
prey, unless the battle was fought and won before that red orb
had passed out of sight. Yes, the besetting fiend of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) family
-- the spirit of defiance and resentment -- that was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>),
even now, while realizing its presence, to disregard all thoughts
save of the revenge for which he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could barter everything -- every
hope once precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>).

<p/>It was horror at such wickedness that first checked him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), and
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) back to the combat. His (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) was not a temper that was
satisfied with half measures. He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) locked his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) hands more rigidly
together, vowing to compel himself, ere he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) left the spot, to forgive
his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) enemy -- forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) candidly -- forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), so as never again
to have to say, ' I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) ! ' He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) did not try to think, for
reflection only lashed up his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) sense of the wrong : but, as if there
was power in the words alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) lips to repeat, --

<p/>' Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass
against us.''

<p/>Coldly and hardly were they spoken at first ; again he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) pro-
nounced them, again, again, -- each time the tone was softer, each
time they came more from the heart. At last the remembrance
of greater wrongs, and worse revilings came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) ; his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) eyes
tilled with tears, the most subduing and healing of all thoughts



<p/>176 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>--that of the great Example-- became present to him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) ; tlie foe
was driven back.

<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) hands over his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) face. The tempter was not
yet defeated without liope. It was not enough to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
first intention -LRB-no great sacrifice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) perceived, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
had time to think how Philip would be certain to treat a chal-
lenge-RRB-, it was not enough to wisli no ill to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin, to intend
no evil measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must pardon from tlie bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) heart,
regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) candidly, and not magnify his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) injuries.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sat long, in deep tliought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head bent down, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) coun-
tenance stern with inward conflict. It was the hardest part of
tlie whole battle, for the Morville disposition was as vindictive as
passionate ; but, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) recovered clearness of vision. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
request might well appear unreasonable, and possibly excite sus-
picion ; and, for the rest, it was doing a man of honour, like Philip,
flagrant in j ustice to suspect liim of originating slanders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was,
of course, under a mistake, had acted, not perhaps kindly, but
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought, rightly and judiciously, in making his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) suspicions
known. If lie had caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle to write provokingly, every
one knew that was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might very properly wish, under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) belief, to save Amabel ; and though the manner might have
been otherwise, the proceeding itself admitted complete justifi-
cation. Indeed, when Guy recollected the frenzy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rage,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own murderous impulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was shocked to think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had ever sought the love of that pure and gentle creature, as
if it had been a cruel and profane linking of innocence to evil.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was appalled at the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not known he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was capable of it, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boyish passion, even when unrestrained,
had never equalled this, in all the strength of early manhood.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked up, and saw that the last remnant of the sun s disk
was just disappearing, beneath the horizon. The victory was won !

<p/>But Guy's feeling was not the rejoicing of the conquest, it was
more the relief which is felt by a little child, weary of its fit of
naughtiness, when its tearful face is raised, mournful yet happy,
in having won true repentance, and it says, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rose, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) watch, wondered to find it so late ; gazed
round, and considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bearings, perceiving, with a sense of
shame, how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had wandered ; then retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) steps slowly
and wearily, and did not reach South Moor till long after dark.

<p/>Philip, according to promise, appeared at Hollywell, and a
volume of awful justice seemed written on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) brow. Charles,
though ignorant of its cause, perceived this at a glance, and
greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thus : --



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 177

<p/>' Enter Don Philip II., the Duke of Alva, alguazils, corregiclors,
and executioners,''

<p/>' Is anything the matter, Philip ? ' said Amy ; a question which
took him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) by surprise, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in ignorance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was sorry for -RSB-ier, and answered gravely, --

<p/>' Nothing is amiss with me, thank you. Amy.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would tell no more, and would
have thought no more about it, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother was
very uneasy.

<p/>' Did you ask wliether there were any letters at the post ? '
said Charles, <div class="bookquote">``Guy is using us shamefully -- practising self-
denial on us, I suppose. Is there no letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' There is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Philip, reluctantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, where is it r

<p/>' It is to your father,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! ' said Charles, with a disappointed air. ' Are you sure ?
Depend on it, you overlooked my M, He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has owed me a letter
tliis fortnight. Let me see,''

<p/>' It is for my uncle,'' repeated Philip, as if to put an end to the
subject,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been so stupid as to forget my second name.
Come, give it me, I shall have it sooner or later.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>' I assure you, Charles, it is not for you,''

<p/>' Would not any one suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been reading it ? ' exclaimed
Charles.

<p/>' Did you know Mary Ross was gone to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) brother
John ? ' broke in Mrs, Edmonstone, in a nervous, hurried manner.

<p/>' No ; is she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ? ' replied Philip.

<p/>' Yes ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wife is ill.''

<p/>The universal feeling was that something was amiss, and
mamma was in the secret. Amy looked wistfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), but
Mrs. Edmonstone only gazed at the window, and so they con-
tinued for some minutes, while an uninteresting exchange of
question and answer was kept up between her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew,
until at length the dressing-bell rang, and cleared the room.
Mrs, Edmonstone lingered till her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) son and daughters were gone,
and said, --

<p/>' You have heard from St, Mildred's 1 '

<p/>' Yes,'' said Philip, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was as little inclined to be commu-
nicative to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousins,

<p/>' From Guy, or from Margaret ? '

<p/>' From Margaret.''

<p/>' But you say there is a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' Yes, for my uncle.''

<p/>' Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) say nothing more satisfactory ? ' asked his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) aunt, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
anxiety tortured by his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) composure, ' Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) learnt no more ? '

<p/>' Nothing more of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) proceedings. I see Amy knows nothing
of the matter 1 '

<p/>' No ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) papa thought there was no need to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) till
we had seen whether he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could explain.''

<p/>N



<p/>178 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Poor little thing ! ' said Philip ; ' I am very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone did not choose to discuss her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter's
affairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) turned the conversation to ask if
Margaret said much of Guy.

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) writes to tell the spirit in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) received my uncle's
letter. It is only the Morville temper, again ; and, of course,
whatever you may think of that on Amy's account, I should
never regard it, as concerns myself, as other than his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) misfortune.
I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) may be able to explain the rest.''

<p/>' All ! there comes your uncle ! ' and Mr. Edmonstone entered.

<p/>' How d'ye do, Philip ? Brought better news, eh ? '

<p/>' Here is a letter to speak for itself.''

<p/>' Eh ? From Guy ? Give it me. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) say ? Let me
see. Here, mamma, read it ; your eyes are best.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone read as follows : --

<p/>``My dear Mr. Edmonstone,-- Your letter surprised and
grieved me very much. I cannot guess what proofs Philip may
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has, of what I never did, and, therefore, I cannot refute
them otherwise than by declaring that I never gamed in my life.
Tell me what they are, and I will answer them. As to a full
confession, I could of course tell you of' much in which I have
done wrongly, though not in the way which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) supposes. On
that head, I have nothing to confess. I am sorry I am prevented
from satisfying you about the #1000, but I am bound in honour
not to mention the purpose for which I wanted it. I am sure
you could never believe I could have said what I did to Mrs.
Edmonstone if I had begun on a course which I detest from the
bottom of my heart. Thank you very much for the kindness
of the latter part of your letter. I do not know how I could
have borne it, if it had ended as it began. I hope you will soon
send me these proofs of Philip's. Ever your affectionate,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``G. M.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Not a little surprised was Philip to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was known to
be Guy's accuser ; but the conclusion revealed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) style had
betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and that Mr. Edmonstone had finished with some
mention of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) resolved that henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would never
leave a letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own dictation till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had seen it signed and
sealed.

<p/>' Well ! ' cried Mr. Edmonstone, joyfully beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own hand
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) glove, `that is all right. I knew it would be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
can't even guess what we are at. I am glad we did not tease
poor little Amy. Eh, mamma ? -- eh, Philip 1 ' the last eh being
uttered much more doubtfully, and less triumphantly than the
first.

<p/>' I wonder you think it right,'' said Philip.

<p/>' What more would you have ? ' said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily,

<p/>' Confidence.''

<p/>' Eh ? Oh, ay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) can't tell -- bound in honour.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 179

<p/>' It is easy to write off-hand, and say I cannot satisfy you, I
am bound in honour ; but that is not what most persons would
think a full justification, especially considering the terms on
which you stand.'' ^

<p/>' Why, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) might have said more. It would have been safe
enough with me.''

<p/>' It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) usual course of mystery, reserve, and defiance.''

<p/>' The fact is,'' said Mr. Edmonstone, turning away, ' that it is
a very proper letter ; right sense, proper feeling -- and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
never gamed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) life, what would you have more ? '

<p/>' There are different ways of understanding such a denial as
this,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' See, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) says not in the way in which I suppose.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand authoritatively, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt was about to
interpose. ' It was against gaming that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) vow was made. I
never thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had played, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) never says he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has not betted.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would never be guilty of a subterfuge ! ' exclaimed Mr.
Edmonstone, indignantly.

<p/>' I should not have thought so, without the evidence of the
payment of the cheque, my uncle had just given him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), to this
gambling fellow,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' yet it is only the natural con-
sequence of the habit of eluding inquiry into his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) visits to London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this gambling fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>' I can't see any reason for so harsh an accusation,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>' I should hardly want more reason than his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
refuses to answer the question on which my uncle's good opinion
depends ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) owns he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been to blame, and thus retracts his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
full denial. In my opinion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letter says nothing so plainly as,
<div class="bookquote">'' While I can stand fair with you, I do not wish to break with
you.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will not find that quite so easy ! ' cried Mr. Edmonstone.
' I am no fool to be hoodwinked, especially where my little Amy
is concerned. I'll see all plain and straight before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) says
another word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). But you see what comes of their settling
it while I was out of the way.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was grieved to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) so hurt at this. It
could not have been helped, and if all had been smooth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) never
would have thought of it again ; but it served to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
dignity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own eyes, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fancied, to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) from
Philip's censure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) therefore made the most of it, which so
pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did not venture to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) championship
of Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Edmonstone, `the question is what to do
next -- eh, Philip? I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would have spoken openly. I
hate mysteries. I'll write and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) this won't do ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must
be explicit -- eh, Philip ? '

<p/>' We will talk it over by and by,'' said Philip.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt understood that it was to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) absence, and left
the room, fearing it would be impossible to prevent Amy from
being distressed, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had no doubt that Guy would be
able to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) innocence of the charges. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found Amy
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room.

<p/>' Don't ring, mamma, dear. I'll fasten your dress,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ;
then pausing -- ' Oh ! mamma, I don't know whether I ought to
ask, but if you would only tell me if there is nothing gone wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I don't believe there is anything really wrong, my dear,'' said
Mrs. Edmonstone, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) saw how her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) colour first
deepened and then faded.

<p/>' Oh I no,* said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).

<p/>' But there is some mystery about his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) money-matters, which
has vexed your papa.''

<p/>' And what has Philip to do Avith it 1 '

<p/>' I cannot quite tell, my dear. I believe Margaret Henley has
heard something, but I do not know the whole.''

<p/>* Did you see his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letter, mamma 1 ' said Amy, in a low,
trembling voice.

<p/>' Yes, it is just like himself, and absolutely denies the accus-
ations.''

<p/>Amy did not say ' then they are false,'' but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head.

<p/>' Then papa is satisfied ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said.

<p/>' I have no doubt all will be made clear in time,<div class="bookquote">'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother ; ' but there is still something unexplained, and I am
afraid things may not go smoothly just now. I am very sorry,
my little Amy, that such a cloud should liave come over you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) added, smoothing fondly the long, soft liair, sad at heart to
see the cares and griefs of womanhood gathering over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cliild's
bright young life.

<p/>* I said I must learn to bear things ! ' murmured Amy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)-
self. ' Only,<div class="bookquote">'' and the tears filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke with
almost childish simplicity of manner, ' I can't bear them to vex
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). I wish Philip would let papa settle it alone. Guy will be
angry, and grieved afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by tlie dinner-bell, but Amy ran into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own room for one moment.

<p/>' I said I would learn to bear,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to herself, ' or I sliall
never be fit for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Yes, I will, even though it is the thinking
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said I must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Verena ; I know wliat
that means ; I ought not to be uneasy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will bear it beauti-
fully, and say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is glad of it afterwards. And I will try not to
seem cross to Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Edmonstone was fidgety and ill at ease, found fault with
the dinner, and was pettish with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife. Mrs. Edmonstone
set Philip off'' upon politics, which lasted till the ladies could
escape into the drawing-room. In anotlier minute Philip brought
in Charles, set him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) down, and departed. ^ Amy, wlio was standing
by the window, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) forehead against the glass, and gazing
into the darkness, turned round hastily, and left the room, but
in passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand into iiis, and received a
kind pressure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and the other three
all began to wonder. Charles said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had regularly been turned
out of the dining-room by Philip, who announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wanted
to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle, and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) off.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 181

<p/>They conjectured, and were indignant at each other's con-
jectures, till their mother returned, and gave them as much
information as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could ; but this only made them very anxious.
Charles was certain that Mrs. Henley had laid a cockatrice egg,
and Philip was hatching it ; and Laura could not trust herself
to defend Philip, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) should do it too vehemently. They
could all agree in desire to know the truth, in hope that Guy
was not culpable, and, above all, in feeling for Amy ; but by tacit
consent they were silent on the three shades of opinion in their
minds. Laura was confident that Philip was acting for the best ;
Mrs. Edmonstone thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might be mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) premises,
but desirous of Guy's real good ; and Charles, though sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
would allege nothing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not believe to be true, also
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ready to draw the worst conclusions from small
grounds, and to take pleasure in driving Mr. Edmonstone to the
most rigorous measures,

<p/>Philip, meanwhile, was trying to practise great moderation
and forbearance, not bringing forward at first what was most
likely to incense Mr. Edmonstone, and without appearance of
animosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) cool, guarded speech. There was no design in
this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) meant only to be just ; yet anything less cool would
have had far less effect.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) shut the dining-room door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) uncle
wavering, touched by the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little Amy, returning to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) first favourable view of Guy's letter, ready to overlook every-
thing, accept the justification, and receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ward on the same
footing as before, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was at the same time ashamed that
Philip should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) relent, and desirous of keeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
character for firmness, little guessing how his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) nephew felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could wield him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at will.

<p/>Perceiving and pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feebleness, and sincerely believing
strong measures the only rescue for Amy, the only hope for Guy,
Philip found himself obliged to work on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) by the production
of another letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would rather, if possible,
have kept this back, so much did his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) honourable feeling recoil
from what had the air of slander and mischief-making ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
regarded firmness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle's part as the only chance for Guy
or for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin, and was resolved not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) swerve from
strict justice.

<p/>Mrs. Henley had written immediately after Guy's outburst in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) house, and, taking it for granted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother would
receive a challenge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) wrote in the utmost alarm, urging him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to remember how precious he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), and not to depart from
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own principles.

<p/>' You would not be so mad as to fight him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), eh ? ' said Mr.
Edmonstone, anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``You know better -- besides, for poor
Amy's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' For the sake of right,<div class="bookquote">'' replied Philip, ' no. I ha^e reassured
my sister. I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that, let the boy do what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
shall never make me guilty of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) death.''



 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>182 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' You have heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), then 1 *

<p/>' No ; I suppose a night's reflection convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had
no rational grounds for violent proceedings, and lie had sense
enough not to expose himself to such an answer as I should have
given. What caused his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wrath to be directed towards me especi-
ally, I cannot tell, nor can my sister,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, looking full
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle ; ' but I seem to have come in for a full share of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) proceeded to read the description of Guy's passion, and the
expressions he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had used. Violent as it had been, it did not lose
in Mrs. Henley's colouring ; and what made the effect worse
was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had omitted to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) liad overheard his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) language,
so that it appeared as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been unrestrained even by gen-
tlemanly feeling, and had thus spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother and uncle
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) presence.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone was resentful now, really displeased, and
wounded to the quick. The point on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was especially
sensitive was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) reputation for sense and judgment ; and that
Guy, who had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so much respect and affection, Avhom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had treated with invariable kindness, and received into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
family like a son, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should thus speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
extremely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was too much overcome even to break out into
exclamations at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only drank off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) glass of wine hastily,
and said, ' I would never have thought it ! '

<p/>With these words, all desire for forbearance and toleration
departed. If Guy could speak thus of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was ready to
believe any accusation, to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deceitful from the first, to
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been trifling with Amy, to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a confirmed
reprobate, and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) off entirely. Philip had some difficulty
to restrain liim from being too violent ; and to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to the
matter in hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) defended Guy from the exaggerations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
imagination in a manner which appeared highly noble, consider-
ing how Guy had spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Before they parted that night,
another letter had been written, which stood thus, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Sir Guy, -- Since you refuse the confidence which I
have a right to demand, since you elude the explanation I asked,
and indulge yourself in speaking in disrespectful terms of me and
my family, I have every reason to suppose that you have no de-
sire to continue on the same footing as lieretofore at Hollywell.
As your guardian, I repeat that I consider myself bound to keep
a vigilant watch over your conduct, and, if possible, to recover you
from the unhappy course in which you have involved yourself ;
but all other intercourse between you and this family must cease.

<p/>' Your horse shall be sent to Redclyffe to-morrow.

<p/>' Yours faithfully,
' C. Edmonstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter was more harsh than Philip wished ; but Mr.
Edmonstone would hardly be prevailed on to consent to enter on
no further reproaches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) insisted on banishing Deloraine, as



<p/>THE HEIR OF BEDCLYFFE 183

<p/>well as on the mention of Guy's disrespect, both against his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
nephew's opinion ; but it was necessary to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own
way on these points, and Philip thought himself fortunate in
getting a letter written which was in any degree rational and
moderate.

<p/>Tliey had been so busy, and Mr. Edmonstone so excited, that
Philip thought it best to accept the offer of tea being sent them
in the dining-room, and it was not till nearly midnight that
their conference broke up, when Mr. Edmonstone found his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife
sitting up by the dressing-room fire, having shut Charles's door,
sorely against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will.

<p/>' There,<div class="bookquote">'' began Mr. Edmonstone, ' you may tell Amy she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) may
give liim up, and a lucky escape she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has had. But this is what
comes of settling matters in my absence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) proceeded with
the narration, mixing the facts undistinguishably witli his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own
surmises, and overwhelming his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife with dismay. If a quarter
of this was true, defence of Guy was out of the question ; and
it was still more impossible to wish Amy's attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to
continue ; and though much was incredible, it was no time to
say so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only hope morning would soften her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's
anger, and make matters explicable.

<p/>Morning failed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) comfort. Mr. Edmonstone repeated
that Amy must be ordered to give up all thoughts of Guy, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) perceived that the words ascribed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood on evidence
wliich could not be doubted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have
spoken them in the first shock of an unjust imputation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have been drawn into some scrape to serve a
friend ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could never suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) capable of all Mr.
Edmonstone imagined.

<p/>The first attempt to plead his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) cause, however, brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
an angry reply ; for Philip, by a hint, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ' never saw a fault
in Guy,'' had put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle's head that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would try to
lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) particularly inaccessible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) influence.

<p/>There was no help for it, then ; poor little Amy must hear the
worst ; and it was not long before Mrs. Edmonstone found her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
waiting in the dressing-room. Between obedience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) conviction of Guy's innocence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tenderness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
daughter, Mrs. Edmonstone had a hard task, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could
scarcely check her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tears as Amy nestled up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) morning kiss.

<p/>' O mamma ! what is it ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dearest, I told you a cloud was coming. Try to bear it.
Your papa is not satisfied with Guy's answer, and it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
spoke some hasty words of papa and Philip ; they have displeased
papa very much, and, my clear child, you must try to bear it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
lias written to tell Guy he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must not think any more of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has spoken hasty words of papa ! ' repeated Amy, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
had not heard the rest. ' How sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must be ! '

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke, Charles's door was pushed open, and in he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came,
half dressed, scrambling on, with but one crutch, to the chair
near which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood, with drooping head and clasped hands.



<p/>184 THE HEIR OF REDCLYTFE

<p/>* Never mind, little Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said ; ' I'll lay my life `tis only
some monstrous figment of Mrs. Henley's. Trust my word, it
will right itself ; it is only a rock to keep true love from running
too smooth. Come, don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>as her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) tears began to flow fast,
' I only meant to cheer you up.''

<p/>' I am afraid, Charlie,<div class="bookquote">'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother, putting a force on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
own feeling, ' it is not the best or kindest way to do her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) good by
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to dwell on hopes of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>' Mamma one of Philip's faction ! ' exclaimed Charles.

<p/>' Of no faction at all, Charles, but I am afraid it is a bad case ; '
and Mrs. Edmonstone related what she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew ; glad to address
herself to any one but Amy, who stood still, meanwhile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hands folded on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother's chair.

<p/>Charles loudly protested that the charges were absurd and
l^reposterous, and would be proved so in no time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would finish
dressing instantly, go to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fatlier, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the
sense of the thing. Amy heard and hoped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, who
had great confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) clear sight, was so cheered as almost
to expect that to-day's post might carry a conciliatory letter.

<p/>Meantime, Laura and Philip met in the breakfast- room, and
in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) anxious inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) an account of
Guy, which, though harsh enough, was far more comprehensible
than what the rest had been able to gather.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was inexpressibly shocked. ' My poor dear little Amy ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
exclaimed. ' O Philip, now I see all you thought to save me from 1 '

<p/>* It is an unhappy business that it ever was permitted ! '

<p/>' Poor little dear ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so happy, so very happy and sweet
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) humility and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) love. Do you know, Philip, I was almost
jealous for a moment that all should be so easy for them ; and I
blamed poverty ; but oh ! there are worse things than poverty ! '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not speak, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dark blue eye softened with the
tender look known only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; and it was one of the precious
moments for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was happy till the rest came
down, and then a heavy cloud seemed to liang on them all
breakfast time.

<p/>Charles, who found anxiety on Guy's account more exciting,
though considerably less agreeable, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had once expected,
would not go away with the womankind ; but as soon as the door
was shut, exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Philip, let me know the true grounds of your
persecution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the womankind</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not a conciliating commencement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father was
offended, and poured out a confused torrent of Guy's imagined
misdeeds, while Philip explained and modified his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exaggerations.

<p/>' So the fact is,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, at length, ' that Guy has asked
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own money, and when in lieu of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) received a letter
full of unjust charges, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) declared Philip was a meddling cox-
comb. I advise you not to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip disdained to reply ; and after a few more of Mr.
Edmonstone's exclamations Charles proceeded,



<p/>THE PIEIR OF REDCLYFFE 185

<p/>' This is the great sum total.''

<p/>' No,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' I have proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gambling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I have shown it to your father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is satisfied.''

<p/>' Is it not proof enough that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is lost to all sense of propriety,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should go and speak in that fashion of us, and to Philip's
own sister ? ' cried Mr. Edmonstone. ' What would you have
more ? '

<p/>' That little epithet applied to Captain Morville is hardly, to
my mind, proof sufficient that a man is capable of every vice,''
said Charles, who, in the pleasure of galling his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin, did not
perceive the harm he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend's cause, by recalling the affront
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, at least, felt most deeply. Mr. Edmonstone grew
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) for disregarding the insulting term applied to
himself ; and Charles, who, though improved in many points,
still sometimes showed the effects of early habits of disrespect to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, answered hastily, that no one could wonder at Guy's
resenting such suspicions ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deserved no blame at all, and
would have been a blockhead to bear it tamely.

<p/>This was more than Charles meant, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) temper was fairly
roused, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said much more than was right or judicious, so
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) advocacy only injured the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had many repre-
sentations to make on the injustice of condemning Guy unheard,
of not even laying before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the proofs on which the charges
were founded, and on the danger of actually driving hitn into
mischief, by shutting the doors of Hollywell against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). ' If
you wanted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is, you are taking the
very best means.''

<p/>Quite true ; but Charles had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father too angry to pay
attention. This stormy discussion continued for nearly two
hours, with no effect save inflaming the minds of all parties.
At last Mr. Edmonstone was called away ; and Charles, rising,
declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should go at that moment, and write to tell Guy
that there was one person at least still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) senses.

<p/>' You will do as you please,'' said Pliilip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for the permission,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, proudly.

<p/>' It is not to me that your submission is due,'' said Philip.

<p/>' I'll tell you what, Philip, I submit to my own father readily,
but I do not submit to Captain Morville's instrument.''

<p/>' We have had enough of unbecoming retorts for one day,'' said
Philip, quietly, and offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arm.

<p/>Much as Charles disliked it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was in too great haste not to
accept it ; and perceiving that there were visitors in the draw-
ing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) desired to go up-stairs.

Philip ; ' but to free my own conscience, let me say this. Take
care how you promote this unfortunate attachment.''

<p/>anger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) threw himself forward, with an impatient movement,
trusting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crutch rather than retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin's arm ; but
the crutch slipped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) grasp at the balusters, and
would have fallen to the bottom of the fliglit if Philip had not
been close behind. Stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) foot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made a barrier,
receiving Charles's weight against his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) breast, and then, taking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) arms, carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) up the rest of the way as easily as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been a child. The noise brought Amy out of the
dressing-room, much frightened, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not speak till
Charles was deposited on the sofa, and assured them he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not
in the least hurt, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would hardly thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin for
having so dexterously saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; and Philip, relieved from
the fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) being injured, viewed the adventure as a mere
ebullition of ill- temper, and went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine helpless log am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) found
himself alone with Amy. <div class="bookquote">``A pretty thing for me to talk of
being of any use, when I can't so much as show my anger at an
impertinence about my own sister, without being beholden for
not breaking my neck to the very piece of presumption that
uttered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, don't speak so,'' began Amy ; and at that moment Philij-RRB-
was close to them, set down the crutch that had been dropped,
and went without speaking.

<p/>' I don't care who hears,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' I say there is no
greater misery in this world than to have the spirit of a man
and the limbs of a cripple. I know if I was good for anything,
things would not long be in this state. I should be at St.
Mildred's by this time, at the bottom of the whole story, and
Philip would be taught to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) words in no time, and make
as few wry faces as suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dignity. But what is the use of
talking? This sofa' -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fist against it -- `is my
prison, and I am a miserable cripple, and it is mere madness in
me to think of being attended to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' O Charlie ! ' cried Amy, caressingly, and much distressed,,
`don't talk so. Indeed, I can't bear it! You know it is
not so.''

<p/>' Do I ? Have not I been talking myself hoarse, showing up
their injustice, saying all a man could say to bring them to
reason, and not an inch could I move them. I do believe Philip
has driven my father stark mad with these abominable stories
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister's, which I verily believe she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) invented herself.''

<p/>' O no, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not. Don't say so.''

<p/>' What ! Are you going to believe them, too ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never!''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is that which drives me beyond all patience,'' proceeded
Charles, `to see Philip lay hold of my father, and twist him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
about as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) chooses, and set every one down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) authority/

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Philip soon goes abroad,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Amy, who could not at the
moment say anything more charitable.

something desperate.''

<p/>' No, they won<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>whispered Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, give me the blotting-book. I'll write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) this
moment, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) we are not all the tools of Philip's malice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy gave the materials to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother, and then turning
away, busied herself in silence as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might, in the employ-
ment her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother had recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), of sorting some garden-
seeds for the cottagers. After an interval, Charles said,

<p/>' Well, Amy, what shall I say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) for you ? '

<p/>There was a little silence, and presently Amy whispered,

<p/>' I don't think I ought.''

<p/>' What 1 ' asked Charles, not catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) very low tones, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head bent down.

<p/>' I don't think it would be right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) repeated, more steadily.

<p/>' Not right for you to say you don't think him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a ^dllain ? '

<p/>``Papa said I was to have no ' and there her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice was

<p/>stopped with tears.

<p/>' This is absurd. Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' when it all was approved
at first, and now my father is acting on a wrong impression ;
what harm can there be in it 1 Every one would do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not think it riglit,'' faltered Amy.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) 1 You'll never have anv more to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), if you don't
take care what you are about.
- ' I can't help it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, in a broken voice. ' It is not right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Nonsense ! folly ! ' said Charles. ' You are as bad as the rest.
When they are persecuting, and slandering, and acting in tlie
most outrageous way against him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and you know one word of
yours would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) through all, you won't say it, to save
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from distraction, and from doing all my father fancies he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
has done. Then I believe you don't care a rush for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and
never want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again, and believe tlie whole monstrous
farrago. I vow I'll say so.''

<p/>' O Charles, you are very cruel ! ' said Amy, with an irrepres-
sible burst of weeping.

<p/>' Then, if you don't believe it, why can't you send one word
to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wept in silence for some moments ; at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, --

<p/>' It would not comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to think me disobedient. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will
trust me without, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will know what you think. You are
very kind, dear Cliarlie ; but don't persuade me any more, for I
can't bear it. I am going away now ; but don't fancy I am angry,
only I don't think I can sit by while you write that letter.''

<p/>Poor little Amy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seldom knew worse pain than at that
moment, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was obliged to go away to put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
power to follow the promptings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart to send the few kind
words which might prove that nothing could shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) love and
trust.

<p/>A fresh trial awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own win-
dow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw Deloraine led out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>) chestnut neck glossy in the

<p/>sun, and William prepared for a journey, and the other servants
shaking hands, and bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) good-bye. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) ride
off, and could hardly help flying back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother to exclaim,
<div class="bookquote">``O Charlie, they have sent Deloraine away !''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>while the longing
to send one kind greeting became more earnest than ever ; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) withstood it, and tlirowing herself on the bed, exclaimed, --
*He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) will never come back -- never, never ! ' and gave way, unre-
strainedly, to a fit of weeping ; nor was it till this had spent
itself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was sitting on the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bed trying to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)-
self, when Laura came in.

<p/>' My own Amy -- my poor, dearest, -- 1 am very soi-iy ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear Laura,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>and Amy gladly rested iier aching
head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew what to do for you ! ' proceeded Laura. ' You
cannot cease to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>), and yet you ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I ought, I suppose I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy in a voice exhausted
with crying.

<p/>' That's right, darling. You will not be weak, and pine for
one who is not worthy.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not worthy, Laura?''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm, and
holding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head.



<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! my poor Amy, we thought-;--
' Yes ; and it is so still. I know it



<p/>is so. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>) did not
doit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then what do you think of Margaret and Philip 1 '

<p/>' There is some mistake.''

<p/>' And how can you defend what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said of papa ? '

<p/>' I don<div class="bookquote">``t,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Amy, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face. ' That is the worst ; but
I am sure it was only a moment's passion, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must be
very unhappy about it now. I don't think papa would mind it,
at least not long, if it was not for this other dreadful misappre-
hension. O, Laura ! why cannot something be done to clear it up?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything will be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura. ``Papa has written to
Mr. Wellwood, and Philip means to go and make inquiries at
Oxford and St. Mildred<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' When 1 ' asked Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not till term begins. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is to have a fortnight s
leave before the regiment goes to Ireland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, I hope it will come right then. People must come to an
understanding when they meet ; it is so different from writing.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will do everything to set things on a right footing. You
may be confident of that. Amy, for your sake as much as any-
thing else.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't think why he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should know I have anythmg to do
with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, blushing. ' I had much rather he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not.''

<p/>' Surely, Amy, you think he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) can be trusted with your secret ;
and there is no one who can take more care for you. You 7nusi
look on him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as one of ourselves.''

<p/>Amy made no answer, and Laura was annoyed.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 189

<p/>' You are vexed with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) for having told this to papa ; but
that is not reasonable of you, Amy ; your better sense must tell
you that it is the only truly kind course, both towards Guy and
yourself.''

<p/>It was said in Pliilip's manner, which perhaps made it harder
to bear ; and Amy could scarcely answer,--

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) means it for the best.''

<p/>' You would not have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) be silent ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, sadly. <div class="bookquote">``No ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should have done
something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might have done it more kindly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura endeavoured to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that nothing could have
been more kind and judicious, and Amy sat dejectedly owning the
good intention, and soothed by the affection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) family ; but
with the bitter suffering of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart unallayed, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fond
tender feelings torn at the thought of what Guy must be en-
during, and with the pain of knowing it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father's work.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had one comfort, in the certainty that Guy would bear it
nobly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was happy to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) confidence confirmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother and Charles ; and one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) need not
give up, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might no longer think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lover,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) Verena still, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew it or not. It
could not be wrong to remember any one in her (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) prayers, and to
ask that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might not be led into temptation, but have strength
to abide patiently. That helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was in the
hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known ; and
a line of poetry seemed to be whispered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) ears, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own
sweet tones, --

<p/>Wait, and the cloud shall roll away.

<p/>So, after the first day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) went on pretty well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) was
indeed silent and grave, and no longer the sunbeam of Holly well ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) share in what was passing, and a common
observer would hardly have remarked the submissive melancholy
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) father was very affectionate, and often
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) jewel of good girls ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was too much afraid of
women's tears to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) about Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) left that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>)
mother : and Mrs. Edmonstone, having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
father's will, was unwilling to say more.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) doubted whether it was judicious to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) in
dwelling on Guy ; for, even supposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) character clear, they
had ofiended him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deeply, and released him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) from any engagement
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), so that there was nothing to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) from forming
an attachment elsewhere. Mrs. Edmonstone did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would ; but it was better to say nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
should not speak prudently, and only keep up the subject in
Amy's mind.

<p/>Charles stormed and wrangled, told Mr. Edmonstone ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was
breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter's heart, that was all ; ' and talked of un-
fairness and injustice, till Mr. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond
all bearing, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own son should call him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) a tyrant, and
accused Guy of destroying all peace in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family.



<p/>190 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>The replies to the letters came ; some thought them satisfactory,
and the others wondered that they thought so. Mr. Wellwood
gave the highest character of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) pupil, and could not imagine
how -any irregularities could be laid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) charge ; but when asked
in plain terms how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) disposed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) time, could only answer in
general, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) had friends and engagements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) own at St.
Mildred's and its neighbourhood, and had been several times at
Mrs. Henley's and at Colonel Harewood's. The latter place,
unfortunately, was the very object of Philip's suspicions ; and
thus the letter was anything but an exculpation.

<p/>Guy wrote to Charles in the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heart, expressing
gratitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confidence and sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again begged for
the supposed evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) misconduct, declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could ex-
plain it, whatever it might be, and proceeded to utter deep
regrets for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hasty expressions.

<p/>' I do not know what I may have said,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wrote ; ' I have no
doubt it was unpardonable, for I am sure my feelings were so,
and that I deserve whatever I have brought on myself. I can
only submit to Mr. Edmonstone's sentence, and trust that time
will bring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knowledge that I am innocent of what I am
accused of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has every right to be displeased with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Charles pronounced this to be only Guy's way of abusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father saw in it a disguised admission of guilt. It
was thought, also, to be a bad sign that Guy intended to remain
at South Moor till the end of the vacation, though Charles argued
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must be somewhere ; and if they wished to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out
of mischief, why exile him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) from Holly well ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would hardly
listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's representation, that on Amy's account it
would not be right to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) there till the mystery was
cleared up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tried to stir his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred's,
and investigate matters for himself ; but, though Mr. Edmonstone
would have liked tJie appearance of being important, this failed,
because Philip declared it to be unadvisable, knowing that it
would be no investigation at all, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle would be
talked over directly. Next, Charles would have persuaded Philip
himself to go, but the arrangements about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) leave did not make
this convenient ; and it was put off till he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) farewell
visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister, in October. Lastly, Charles wrote to Mrs.
Henley, entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) some information about this
mysterious evidence which was wanting ; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) reply was a
complete ' set down ' for interference in a matter with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
had no concern.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was very angry. In fact, the post seldom came in without
occasioning a fresh dispute, which only had the effect of keeping
up the heat of Mr. Edmonstone's displeasure, and making the
whole house uncomfortable.

<p/>Fretf ulness and ill-humour seemed to have taken possession of
Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father. Such a state of things had not prevailed
since Guy's arrival ; Hollywell was hardly like the same house j



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 191

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura could do nothing without being
grumbled at or scolded by one or other of the gentlemen ; even
Amy now and tlien came in for a little petulance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father's
part, and Charles could not always forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for saying, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mournful, submissive tone, -- ' It is of no use to talk about it.''



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>This just decree alone I know,
Man must be disciplined by woe,

I'll bow my spirit, and be still.

<p/>Guy, in the meantime, was enduring the storm in loneliness,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was unwilling to explain the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) trouble to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
companions. The only occasion of the suspicions, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
think of, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) request for the sum of money ; and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
not mention to Mr. Wellwood, nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) inclined to make confi-
dants of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) other companions, though pleasant, right-minded
youths.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) had only announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) had had a letter which had
grieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) considerably, but of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) could not mention the
contents ; and as Harry Graham, who knew something of the
Broadstone neighbourhood, had picked up a report that Sir Guy
Morville was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy, there was an idea
among the party that there was some trouble in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
attachment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had once before been made, by some joke, to
colour and look conscious ; and now this protected him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) from in-
convenient questions, and accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) depression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was
like what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been on first coming to Hollywell -- grave and
silent, falling into reveries when others were talking, and much
given to long, lonely wanderings. Accustomed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been
in boyhood to a solitary life in beautiful scenery, there was some-
thing in a fine landscape that was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) like a friend and com-
panion ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sometimes felt that it would have been worse if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been in a dull, uniform country, instead of among moun-
tain peaks and broad wooded valleys. Working hard, too, helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) not a little, and conic sections served him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) almost as well as
they served Laura.

<p/>A more real help was the neighbourhood of Stylehurst. On
the first Sunday after receiving Mr. Edmonstone's letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
went to church there, instead of with the others, to St. Mildred's.
They thought it was for the sake of the solitary walk ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
had other reasons for the preference. In the first place, it was a
Communion Sunday, and in the next, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could feel more kindly
towards Philip there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) needed all that could
strengthen such a disposition.

<p/>Many a question did he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ask himself, to certify whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
wilfully entertained malice, or hatred, or any uncharitableness.



<p/>192 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>It was a long, difficult examination ; but at its close, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt con-
vinced that, if such passions knocked at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) heart, it
was not at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own summons, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) drove them away with-
out listening to them. And surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might approach to gain
tlie best aid in that battle, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
strong and deep repentance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fit of passion, and longing
earnestly for the pledge of forgiveness.

<p/>The pardon and peace he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sought came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and in such
sort that the comfort of that day, when fresh from the first
shock, and waiting in suspense for some new blow, was such as
never to be forgotten. They linked themselves with the grave
shade of the clustered gray columns, and the angel heads on the
roof of that old church ; with the long grass and tall yellow
mullens among its churchyard graves, and with the tints of the
elm-trees that closed it in, their leaves in masses either of green
or yellow, and opening here and there to show the purple hills
beyond.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) wandered in the churchyard between the services. All
enmity to Philip was absent now ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt as if it would
hardly return when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stood by the graves of the Archdeacon
and of the two Frances Morvilles, and thought what that spot
was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) cousin. There were a few flowers planted round Mrs.
Morville's grave, but they showed that they had long been
neglected, and no such signs of care marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) daughter Fanny's.
And when Guy further thought of Mrs. Henley, and recollected
liow Philip had sacrificed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cherished prospects and hopes
of distinction, and embraced an irksome profession, for the sake
of these two sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not find it difficult to excuse the
sternness, severity, and distrust which were an evidence how
acutely a warm heart had suffered.

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) suffered cruelly from being cut off from Amy, yet
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) reverence for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to submit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had always felt
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was too far above him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
liopes, been allowed to aspire to the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), it was on
trial, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) failure, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old evil passions, had sunk
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shuddered to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) being united to
anything so unlike herself, and which might cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so much
misery ; it was wretchedness to think that even now she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might
be suffering for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; and yet not for worlds would he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) have lost
the belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so feeling, or the remembrance of the
looks which liad shone on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so sweetly and timidly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's feet ; though that remembrance was only another
form of misery. But Amy would be tranquil, pure and good,
whatever became of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should always be able to think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), looking like one of those peaceful spirits, with bending
head, folded hands, and a star on its brow, in the Paradiso of
Flaxman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) serenity would be untouched ; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
might be lost to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could still be content while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
look up at it through his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turbid life. Better she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) were lost to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) than that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) peace should be injured.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 193

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) still, of course, earnestly longed to prove his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) innocence,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hopes lessened ; for as long as the evidence was with-
held, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had no chance. After writing as strongly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could do no more, except watch for something that might
unravel the mystery ; and Charles's warm sympathy and readi-
ness to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) were a great comfort.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) uncle again ; perhaps Sebastian was
ashamed to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) after their last encounter, and was still
absent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) engagement ; but the wife and cliild were still at
8t. Mildred's, and one afternoon, when Guy had rather unwil-
lingly gone thither with Mr. Well wood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saw Mrs. Dixon
sitting on one of the benches which were placed on the paths
cut out on the side of the hill, looking very smart and smiling,
among several persons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own class.

<p/>To be ashamed to recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was a weakness beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), and was leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), pluming herself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
notice, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saw little Marianne's blue eyes fixed wistfully
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ran up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
joyfully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a few steps from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother's party.
' Well, little one, how are you ? I have your piece of spar quite
safe. Have you said how d'ye do to Bustle ? '

<p/>' Bustle ! Bustle ! ' called the soft voice ; but it needed a whistle
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) master to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to be caressed by the little girl.

<p/>' Have you been taking any more pleasant walks 1 '

<p/>' Oh yes. We have been all round these pretty paths. And
I should like to get to the top of this great high hill, and see all
round ; but mamma says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has got a bone in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leg, and
cannot go.''

<p/>' Do you think mamma M^ould give you leave to go up with
me ? Should you like it ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coloured all over ; too happy even to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, <div class="bookquote">``I will meet you here when
you have done your business in the town, in an hour or so.
Poor little thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) has not many pleasures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>tutor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs Dixon made no difficulty, and was so profuse in thanks
that Guy got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) way as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could, and was soon
on the soft thy my grass of the hill-side, the little girl frisking
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in great delight, playing with Bustle, and chattering
merrily.

<p/>Little Marianne was a delicate child, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) frolics did not
last long. As the ascent became steeper, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) breath grew shorter,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) toiled on in a resolute uncomplaining manner after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
long, vigorous steps, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) looked round, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) panting
far behind, turned to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), till the
top Avas achieved, and the little girl stood on the topmost stone,
gazing round at the broad sunny landscape, with the soft green
meadows, the harvest fields, the woods in their gorgeous autumn
raiment, and the moorland on the other side, with its other peaks
and cairns, brown with withered bracken, and shadowed in
moving patches by the floating clouds. The exhilarating wind

<p/>o



<p/>194 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>brought a colour into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale cheeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flossy curls were
blowing over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in silence, pleased and curious to observe
how so beautiful a scene struck the childish eye of the little
Londoner. The first tiling she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, after three or four minutes'
contemplation -- a long time for such a child -- was, ' Oh ! I never
saw anything so pretty ! ' then presently after, ' Oh, I wish little
brother Felix was here ! ' ^

<p/>' This is a pleasant place to think about your little brother,''
said Guy, kindly ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face, and exclaimed,
' Oh ! do you know about Felix ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``Here, sit on my knee, and
rest after your scramble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Mamma never lets me talk of Felix, because it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
cry,<div class="bookquote">'' said Marianne ; ' but I wish it sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Felix</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) little heart was soon open. It appeared that Felix was
the last who had died, the nearest in age to Marianne, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
favourite playfellow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) told of some of their sports in their
London home, speaking of them with eagerness and fondness
tliat showed what joys they had been, though to Guy they seemed
but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) talked of
walks to school, when Felix would tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would do when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was a man, anl how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) at the crossings, and
how rude boys used to drive them, and how they would look in
at the shop windows and settle what they would buy if they
were rich. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) being ill -- ill so very long ;
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little chair, and could not play, and tlien
always lay in bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) liked to sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) there ; but at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) died, and they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) away in a great black coffin, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would never come back again. But it was so dull now, there
was no one to play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>).

<p/>Though the little girl did not cry, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked very mournful,
and Guy tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).
' Going to heaven ' only conveyed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a notion of death and
separation, and this phrase, together with a vague idea who had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to be good, seemed to be the extent
of the poor child's religious knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hardly ever had
been at church ; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had read one or two Bible
stories, it seemed to have been from their having been used as
lessons at school. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a dim notion that good people read
the Bible, and there was one on the little table at home, witli
the shell-turkey-cock standing upon it, and mamma read it when
Felix died ; but it was a big book, and the shell-turkey-cock
always stood upon it ; in short, it seemed only connected with
mamma's tears, and the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Guy was very much shocked, and so deep in thought that lie could
hardly talk to the child in their progress down the hill ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>)
was just so tired as to be inclined to silence, and quite happy
clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) over to her (<font color='blue'><b>Felix</b></font>) mother at the
foot of the hill, and went to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, at the place appointed.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 195

<p/>' Wellwood/ said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), breaking silence, when they had walked
about half way back to the farm, `do you think your cousin
would do me a great kindness 1 You saw that child ? Well, if
the parents consent, it would be the gre<itest cliarity on earth
if Miss Wellwood would receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) school/

<p/>' On what terms 1 What sort of an education is she (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) to liave 1 '

<p/>' The chief thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) wants is to be tauglit Christianity, poor
cliild ; the rest Miss Wellwood may settle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) is my first cousin.
I don't know whether you are acquainted with our family
liistory 1 ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went on to explain as much as was needful.
It ended in a resolution that if Miss Wellwood would undertake
the charge, the proposal should be made to Mrs. Dixon.

<p/>It was a way of assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) relations likely to do real good,
and on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would be able, under colour of the
liayment for the child, to further Miss Wellwood's schemes, and
give lier the interest of the thousand pounds, until his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) five and
twentieth year might put his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) property in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own power.

<p/>Miss Wellwood readily consented, much pleased with tlie
simplicity and absence of false shame he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) showed in the whole
transaction, and very anxious for the good of a child in a class
so difficult to reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) next went to Mrs. Dixon, expecting
more difficulty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) found none. Slie thouglit it
better Marianne should live at St. Mildred's than die in London,
and was ready to catch at the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) being fitted for a
governess. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was so strongly persuaded that the rich
cousin might make Marianne's fortune, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would have been
very unwilling to interfere with the fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had taken for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>Little Marianne was divided between fear of leaving mamma
and liking for St. Mildred's, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) first interview with Miss
Wellwood, and Miss Jane's showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a little white bed, quite
turned the scale in their favour. Before the time came for Guy's
return to Oxford, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) settled, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own account
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) happy life, and had listened to Miss Jane Wellwood's
delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sweet temper and good disposition.

<p/>Those thousand pounds ; Guy considered again and again
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could explain their destination, and whether this
would clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only a minor charge, and
besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repugnance to mention such a design, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw too
many obstacles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way. Captain Morville and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sister were
the very persons from whom Miss Wellwood's project was to be
kept secret. Besides, what would be gained ? It was evident
that Guy's own assertions were doubted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could bring no
confirmation of them ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never spoken of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intention to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor, and Mr. Wellwood could, therefore, say nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>)
favour. If Mr. Edmonstone alone had been concerned, or if this
had been the only accusation, Guy might have tried to explain
it ; but with Philip he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew it would be useless, and therefore
would not enter on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could only wait patiently.

<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>Most delicately, hour by hour,

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) canvassed human mysteries,

<p/>And stood aloof from other minds.

<p/>Himself unto himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sold,

<p/>Upon himself, himself did feed.

<p/>Quiet, dispassionate, and cold,

<p/>With chiselled features clear and sleek,-- Tennyson

<p/>Guy had been about a week at Oxford, when one evening, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was sitting alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) received an unexpected
visit from Captain Morville. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was glad, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) thought a
personal interview would remove all misconstructions, and held
out his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) hand cordially, saying : --

<p/>' You here, Philip ! When did you come ? '

<p/>* Half an hour ago. I am on my way to spend a week with
the Thorndales. I go on to-morrow to my sister<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>While speaking, Philip was surveying tlie apartment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
held that a man's room is generally an indication of liis disposi-
tion, and assuredly there was a great deal of character in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
own, with the scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste of its
arrangements. Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could not fail to see traces
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) cousin's habits, but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was obliged to confess to himself
that there was very little to guide him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). The furniture was
strictly as its former occupant liad left it, only rather the worse
for wear, and far from being in order. The chairs were so heaped
with books and papers, that Guy had to make a clearance of one
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) visitor could sit down ; but there was nothing else to
complain of, not even a trace of cigars ; but knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to be
a great reader and lover of accomplishments, Philip wondered
that the only decorations were Laura's drawing of Sintram, and
a little print of RedclyfFe, and the books were chiefly such as
were wanted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) studies ; the few others liaving for the most
part the air of old library books, as if lie had sent for them from
Redclyffe. Was this another proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had some way of
frittering away his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) money with nothing to show for it? A
Sophocles and a lexicon were ojDen before him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) on the table, and
a blotting-book, which lie closed, but not before Philip had
caught sight of what looked like verses.

<p/>Neither did his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) countenance answer Philip's expectations. It
had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) usual bright lively expression ; there was a sadness
which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) smile like a gleam on a shov/ery day, instead of
constant sunshine ; but there was neither embarrassment nor
defiance, and the gleam-like smile was there, as with a frank,
confiding tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, --

<p/>' This is very kind of you, to come and see what you can do
for me.''

<p/>Philip was by no means preimred to be thus met half-way, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought Guy wanted to secure him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as an intercessor, and
hardened himself into righteous severity.



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 197

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one can be more willing to help you than I, but you
must, in the first place, lielp yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Instantly the sedate measured tone made Guy's heart and
head throb with impatience, awakening all the former memories
so liardly battled down ; but with tlie impulse of anger came
the thought, ' Here it is again ! If I don't keep it down now,
I am undone ! The enemy will seize me again ! ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forced
himself not to interrupt, while Philip went calmly on.

<p/>' While you are not open, nothing can be done.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My only wish, my only desire, is to l-RRB-e open,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy,
speaking fast and low, and repressing the feeling, which, never-
theless, affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice ; ' but the opportunity of explanation
has never been given me.''

<p/>' You need complain of that no longer. I am here to convey
to my uncle any explanation you may wish to address to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
I will do my best to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to attend to it favourably, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is deeply offended and hurt by what has passed.''

<p/>' I know -- I know,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, colouring deeply, and all irrita-
tion disappearing from voice and manner ; ' I know there is no
excuse for me. I can only repeat that I am heartily sorry for
whatever I may have said', either of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) or of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Of course,<div class="bookquote">'' returned Philip, ' I should never think of resenting
what you may have said in a moment of irritation, especially as
you express regret for it. Consider it as entirely overlooked on
my part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy was nearly choked in uttering a ' Thank you,'' which did
not sound, after all, much like acceptance of forgiveness.

<p/>' Now to the real matter at issue,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip : ' the applica-
tion for the money, which so amazed Mr. Edmonstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I do not see that it is the point,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' I wanted it for
a scheme of my own : he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not think fit to let me have it, so
there is an end of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Mr. Edmonstone does not think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wishes to be con-
vinced that you have not spent it beforehand.''

<p/>' What would you have beyond my word and honour that I
have not 1 ' exclaimed Guy.

<p/>' Far be it from me to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) doubts it,'' said Philip ; and
as at those words the flash of the Morville eye darted lightning,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) expected that the next moment, ' Do you 1 ' would be tliun-
dered forth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not, with truth, answer ' No ; ' but it
was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) maxims that a man need never be forced into an
open quarrel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tranquilly continued -- ' but it is better not
to depend entirely on assertion. Why do you not bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
full proofs of your good intention, and thus restore yourself to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confidence 1 '

<p/>' I have said that I am bound not to mention the purpose.''

<p/>' Unfortunate ! ' said Philip ; then, Avhile Guy bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip till it
bled, the pain really a relief, by giving some vent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) anger
at the implied doubt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went on, -- -<div class="bookquote">``If it is impossible to clear
this up, the next advice I would give is, that you should show



<p/>198 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>what your expenditure has been ; lay your accounts before him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>),
and let them justify you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Most people would have resented this as an impertinent pro-
posal, were it only that doing so would have served td conceal
the awkward fact that the accounts had not been kept at all.
Guy had never been tauglit to regard exactness in this respect
as a duty, had no natural taste for precision, and did not feel
responsible to any person ; nor, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had kept any, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
have shown them, without exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle. To refuse, would,
however, be a subterfuge, and after a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made an effort,
and confessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had none to show ; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew Philip
would despise him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for it as a fool, and probably take it as posi-
tive evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>It would have been more bearable if Philip would but have
said ' How foolish,'' instead of drily repeating ' Unfortunate ! '

<p/>After a pause, during which Guy was not sufficiently master
of himself to speak, Philip added-- ' Then this matter of the
thousand pounds is to be passed over ? You have no explanation
to ofFer 1 '

<p/>' No : ' and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) paused. ' When my word is not accepted,
I have no more to say. But this is not the point. What I
would know is, what are the calumnies that accuse me of having
gamed ? If you really wish to do me a service, you will give
me an opportunity of answering these precious proofs.''

<p/>' I will,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Philip ; who could venture on doing so
himself, thougli, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister's sake, it was unsafe to trust Mr.
Edmon stone, with whom what was not an absolute secret was
not a secret at all. ' My uncle knows that a thirty pound cheque
of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), in your name, was paid by you to a notorious gamester.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy did not shrink, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) simply answered -- ' It is true.''

<p/>' Yet you have neither played, nor betted, nor done anything
that could come under the definition of gambling ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then why this payment ? '

<p/>' I cannot explain that. I know appearances are against me,<div class="bookquote">''
replied Guy, steadily, and with less irritation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
hitherto shown. ' I once thought my simple word would have
sufficed ; but since it seems that will not do, I will not again
make what you call assertions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' In fact, while you profess a desire to be open and sincere, a
mystery appears at every turn. What would you have us do ? '

<p/>' As you think fit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered proudly.

<p/>Philip had been used to feel men's wills and characters bend
and give way beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) superior force of mind. They might,
like Charles, chafe and rage, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) calmness always gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
the ascendant almost without exertion, and few people had ever
come into contact with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) without a certain submission of
will or opinion. With Guy alone it was not so ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been
sensible of it once or twice before ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had no masteiy, and
could no more bend that spirit than a bar of steel. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 199

<p/>could not bear, for it obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to be continually making
efforts to preserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own sense of superiority.

<p/>' Since this is your ultimatum,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said -- ' since you deny your
confidence, and refuse any reply to these charges, you have no
right to complain of suspicion. I shall do my best, both as your
true friend, and as acting with your guardian's authority, to dis-
cover all tliat may lead to the elucidation of the mystery. In the
first place, I am desired to make every inquiry here as to your
conduct and expenditure. I liope they will prove satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am very much obliged to you,'' answered Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice
stern and dignified ; and the smile that curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip was like
Philip's own.

<p/>Philip was positively annoyed, and desirous to say something
to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) down, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not committed himself by any
vehemence, and Philip was too cool and wise to compromise his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
own dignity ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rose to go, saying, ' Good night ! I am sorry
I cannot induce you to act in the only way that can right you.''

<p/>' Good night ! ' replied Guy, in the same dignified manner in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had spoken ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) passion had been surmounted.

<p/>They parted, each feeling that matters were just where they
were before. Philip went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) inn, moralizing on the
pride and perverseness which made it impossible to make any
impression on a RedclyfFe Morville, whom not even the fear of
detection could lead to submission.

<p/>Next morning, while Philip was hastily breakfasting, the door
opened, and Guy entered, pale and disturbed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been
awake all night.

<p/>' Philip ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) frank, natural voice, ' I don't think
we parted last night as your good intentions deserved.''

<p/>' O, ho ! ' thought Philip ; ' the fear of an investigation has
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to reason ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, ' Well, I am very glad you
see things in a truer light this morning ; ' then asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
breakfasted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cousin added,

<p/>' Have you anything to say on the matter we discussed last

<p/>night r

<p/>' No. I can only repeat that I am not guilty, and wait for
time to show my innocence. I only came to see you once more,
that I might feel we parted friends.''

<p/>' I shall always hope to be a true friend.''

<p/>' I did not come here for altercation,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy -LRB-an answer
rather to the spirit than the words-RRB-, ' so I will say no more. If you
wish to see me again, you will find me in my rooms. Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip was puzzled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wondered whether Guy had come
wishing to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), but had found pride indomitable at
the last moment ; or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been showing himself too
severely just to admit entreaty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would be able to judge
better after he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) inquiries, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) proceeded with
them at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) met with no such replies as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) expected.
Every one spoke of Sir Guy Morville in high terms, as strict in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) habits of application, and irreproachable in conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)



<p/>200 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>was generally liked, and some regret was expressed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) lived
in so secluded a manner, forming so few intimacies ; but no one
seemed to think it possible that anything wrong could be
imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). Philip could even perceive that there was
some surprise that such inquiries should be made at all, espe-
cially by so young a man as himself. Mr. Wellwood, the person
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) most wished to see, was not at Oxford, but was at home
preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) ordination.

<p/>Nor could Philip get nearer to the solution of the mystery
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went to the tradesmen, who were evidently as much
surprised as the tutors, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) always paid in ready money.
Captain Morville felt like a lawyer whose case is breaking down,
no discoveries made, nothing done ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was not one whit con-
vinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) cousin's innocence, thinking the college authorities
blind and careless, and the tradesmen combined to conceal
their extortions, or else that the mischief had been done at St.
Mildred's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was particularly provoked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) remembered
Guy's invitation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) rooms, knowing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
must have done, what would be the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) inquiry.

<p/>Philip was conscious that it would have been kind to have gone
to say that, so far, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had found nothing amiss, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not
like giving Guy this passing triumph. It made no difference in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) real opinion ; and why renew a useless discussion ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) per-
suaded himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had left himself no time, and should miss
the train, and hastened off to the station, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had to wait
a quarter of an hour, consoling himself with reflecting --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, though I might have gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), it would have
been useless. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is obstinate, and occasions of irritating his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
unfortunate temper are above all to be avoided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>One short year after, what would not Philip have given for
that quarter of an hour !

<p/>By six o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was at St. Mildred's, greeted with delight
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister, and with cordiality by Dr. Henley. They were
both proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), and every tender feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) sister had, was
for Philip, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pupil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) childhood, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) most
valued companion and counsellor through her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) early womanhood.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a picked dinner-party to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew the
doctor's conversation was not exactly the thing to entertain him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
through a whole evening, and the guests might well think they
had never seen a handsomer or more clever brother and sister
than Mrs. Henley and Captain Mor^dlle. The old county families,
if they did wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) marriage, were always glad to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
brother, and it was a great pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to see old friends.

<p/>Only once did his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister, in the course of the evening, make
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) feel the difference of their sentiments, and that was about
Miss Wellwood. Philip defended her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) warmly ; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
heard that there was a plan getting up for excluding her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) from
the hospital, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) expressed strong disapprobation at the time ;
and after the guests Avere gone, spoke upon the subject with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband. The doctor entered into no party



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 201

<p/>questions, and had only been stirred up to the opposition by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
wife ; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) owned that the Miss Wellwoods had done a great deal
of good, and made the nurses do their duty better than he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had
ever known, and was quite ready to withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opposition.
Mrs. Henley argued about opinions, but Philip was a match for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) own line ; and the end of it was, that tliough she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
would not allow herself to be convinced, and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) head at
lier brother's way of tl linking, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had prevailed, and
that Miss Wellwood would be unmolested.

<p/>There was not another person in the world to whom Margaret
would have yielded ; and it served to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to the sense
of Universal dominion which had been a little shaken by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
conversation with Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Guy.was a great deal with the Wellwoods, `said Mrs. Henley.

<p/>' Was he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), indeed ? '

<p/>' O, you need not think of that. It would be too absurd. The
youngest must be twice his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I was not thinking of any such thing,'' said Philip, smiling, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought of the very different course Guy's affections had taken,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did hear he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy. Is
there anything in that report ? '

<p/>' No ; certainly not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I should pity the woman who married him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), after the specimen
I saw of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) temper.''

<p/>' Poor boy ! ' said Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lady Eveleen has been a great deal at Holly well, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>)

<p/>' Considering what a catch he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be for one of the Edmon-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you had just been pitying the woman who should
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). Perhaps my aunt had Lady Eveleen there to act as
a screen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) own daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That our good-natured aunt should have acted with such
ultra-prudence ! ' said Margaret, laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) grave ironical
tone. ' Lady Eveleen is very pretty, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) not 1 A mere beauty,
I believer

<p/>' Just so ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) is much admired ; but Guy is certainly not
inclined to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I should have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the very man to fall in love young,

in a very lover-like way. Do you admire Laura so much?''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is very pretty.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And little Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is a mere child, and will hardly ever be anything more ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is a very good little amiable thing.''

<p/>' I wish poor Charles's temper was improved.''

<p/>*So do I ; but it is very far from improvement at present, in



<p/>202 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) zeal for Guy. Guy has been very attentive
and good-natured to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and has quite won his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heart ; so that
I should positively honour him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for liis championship if it was
not in great degree out of opposition to liis fatlier and myself.
To-morrow, Margaret, you must give me some guide to the most
probable quarters for learning anything respecting tliis poor
boy's follies.''

<p/>Mrs. Henley did her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) best in that way, and Philip followed up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) inquiries with great ardour, but still unsuccessfully. Jack
Wliite, the hero of the draft, was not at St. Mildred's, nor likely
to be heard of again till the next races ; and whether Sir Guy
liad been on the race-ground at all was a doubtful point. Next,
Philip walked to Stylehurst, to call on Colonel Harewood, and
see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could learn anything in conversation witli him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; but
the Colonel did not seem to know anything, and liis sons were
not at home. Young Morville was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) thought, a spirited lad,
very good-natured ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had been out sliooting once or twice with
Tom, and had a very fine spaniel. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been at the races,
the Colonel did not know it ; lie had some thoughts of asking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to join their party, but had been prevented.

<p/>This was no reason, thought Philip, why Guy might not have
been with Tom Harewood Avithout the Colonel's knowledge. Tom
was just the man to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) amongst those who were given to
betting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have been drawn in, and, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had
given some pledge of payment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was of age, or, possibly,
obtained an immediate supply of money from the old steward at
Redclyffe, who was devotedly attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>). If so, Philip
trusted to be able to detect it from the accounts ; on the other
supposition, there was no hope of discovery.

<p/>The conversation with Colonel Harewood kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so late
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had no time for going, as usual, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) old haunts, at
Stylehurst ; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) feel inclined just then to revive the sad-
dening reflections they excited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spent the evening in talking
over books with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sister, and the next day proceeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
journey to Thorndale Park.

<p/>This was one of the places where he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was always the most
welcome, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had been a school-boy, received in a way
especially flattering, considering that the friendship was entirely
owing to the uncompromising good sense and real kindness with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had kept in order the follies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) former fag.

<p/>Charles might laugh, and call them the young man and young
man's companion, and Guy more classically term them the pious
^neas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fidus Achates, but it was a friendship that did
honour to both ; and the value that the Thorndales set upon
Captain Morville was not misplaced, and scarcely over-rated.
Not particularly clever themselves, they the more highly appre-
ciated his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) endowments, and were proud that ' James ' had been
able to make such a friend ; for they knew, as well as the rest of
the world, that Captain Morville was far from seeking the
acquaintance for the sake of their situation in life, but that it



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 203

<p/>was from real liking and esteem. How far this esteem was
gained by the deference the whole family jDaid to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) opinion,
was another question ; at any rate, the courting was from them.

<p/>The Miss Tliorndales deemed Captain Morville the supreme
authority in drawing, literature, and ecclesiastical architecture ;
and whenever a person came in their way who was thought
liandsome, always pronounced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was not by any means
equal to James's friend. Lady Thorndale deliglited to talk over
James with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) kindness ; and Lord
Thoi`ndale, rather a pompous man himself, liked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somewhat
stately manners, and talked politics with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sincerely wishing
lie was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour at RedclyfFe, and calculating how much
good he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would do there. Philip listened with interest to accounts
of how the Thorndale and Morville influence had always divided
the borough of Moorworth, and, if united, might disjDose of it at
will, and returned evasive answers to questions what the young
heir of Redclyfie might be likely to do.

<p/>James Thorndale drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) friend to Redclyfle, as Philip had
authority from -RSB-\Ir. Edmon stone to transact any business that
might be required with Markham, the steward ; and, as has been
said before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ex^Dected to discover in the accounts something
that might explain why Guy had ceased to press for the thousand
pounds. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could find nothing amiss in them, though
-- bearing in mind that it is less easy to detect the loss of a score
of sheep than of one -- lie subjected them to a scrutiny which
seemed by no means agreeable to the gruff old grumbling steward.
He (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) also walked about the park, saw to the marking of certain
trees that were injuring each other ; and finding that there was
a misunderstanding between Markham and the new rector, Mr.
Ashford, about certain parish matters, where the clergyman was
certainly right, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) bore down Markham's ojDposition with Mr.
Edmonstone's weight, and felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was doing good service.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) paused at the gate, and looked back at the wide domain
and fine old house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) pitied them, and the simple-hearted,
honest tenantry, for being the heritage of such a family, and the
possession of one so likely to misuse them, instead of training
them into the means of conferring benefits on them, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
country. What would not Philip himself do if those lands were
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), -- just what was needed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) talents free scope ? and
what would it be to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) beautiful Laura their mistress ?

<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) week at Thorndale Park, Captain Morville returned
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) farewell visit at Holly well, before joining his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
regiment at Cork, whence it was to sail for the Mediterranean.



<p/>204 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) reckoned much on tliis \4sit, for not even Laura herself could
fathom the depth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), strengthening in the
recesses where he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) so sternly concealed it, and viewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ever as
more faultless since she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) liad been his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) own. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
noble, strong-minded, generous, fond Laura, lie could bear with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sister, witli the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) home, and
witli the trials that had made liim a grave, severe man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
proved the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mind by the self-command lie had
tauglit her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and for which lie was especially grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), as it
made liim safer and more unconstrained, able to venture on more
demonstration than in those early days when every look had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) blush and tremble.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone brought the carriage to fetch 1dm from the
station, and quickly began, --

<p/>' I suppose, as you have not written, you have found notliing
out?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' And you could do nothing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). Eli ? '

<p/>' No ; I could not get a word of explanation, nor break through
the fence of joride and reserve. I must do him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) the justice to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) bears the best of characters at Oxford ; and if there were
any debts I could not get at them from the tradesmen.''

<p/>' Well, well, say no more about it ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) is an ungrateful young
dog, and I am sick of it. I only wish I could wash my hands of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>) altogether. It was mere folly to ex^Dect any of that set could
ever come to good-. There's everything going wrong all at once
now ; poor little Amy breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart after him (<font color='blue'><b>Eli</b></font>), and, worse
than all, there's poor Charlie laid up again,'' said Mr. Edmonstone,
one of the most affectionate people in the world ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) maun-
dering mood making him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) speak of Charles's illness as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only
regarded it as an additional provocation for himself.

<p/>' Charles ill ! ' exclaimed Philip.

<p/>' Yes ; another of those formations in the joint. I hoped and
trusted that was all over now ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is as bad as ever, -- has not
been able to move for a week, and goodness knows when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
will again.''

<p/>' Indeed ! I am very sorry. Is there as much pain as before ? '

<p/>' Oh, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has not slept a wink these four nights. Mayerne
talks of opium ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) won't have it till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has seen you,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is so anxious about this unlucky business. If anything could
persuade me to have Guy back again, it would be that this
eternal fretting after him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is so bad for poor Charlie.''

<p/>' It is on Amy's account that it is impossible to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) here,''
said Philip.

<p/>' Ay ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shall never set eyes on Amy again unless all this is
cleared up, which it never will be, as I desire mamma to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).
By the bye, Philip, Amy said something of your having a slip
with Charles on the stairs.''

<p/>' There was very nearly an accident ; but I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
not hurt. I hope it has nothing to do with this illness ? '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 205

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) says it was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own fault,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone, * and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) should have been actually down but for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' But is it really thouglit it can have caused this attack ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly suppose so; but Thompson fancies there may
have been some jar. However, don't distress yourself ; I dare
say it would have come on all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip did not like to be forgiven by Mr. Edmonstone, and
there was sometliing very annoying in liaving this mischance
connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) name, though without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fault ; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
wish Charles to have the kind of advantage over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that might
be derived from seeming to pass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) share in the misfortune.

<p/>When they arrived at HoUywell, it was twilight, but no one
was in the drawing-room, generally so cheerful at that time of
day ; the fire had lately been smothered with coals, and looked
gloomy and desolate. Mr. Edmonstone left Philip there, and
ran up to see how Charles was, and soon after Laura came in,
sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) side, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand in both hers.

<p/>' You bring no good news ? ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), sadly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) read the
answer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face. ' O ! how I wish you had. It would be such
a comfort now. You have heard about poor Charlie ? '

<p/>' Yes ; and very sorry I am. But, Laura, is it really thought
that accident could have occasioned it ? '

<p/>' Dr. Mayerne does not think so, only Mr. Thompson talked of
remote causes, when Amy mentioned it. I don't believe it did
any harm, and Charlie himself says you saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) from falling
down-stairs,''

<p/>Philip had begun to give Laura his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) version of the accident, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had already done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father, when Mrs, Edmonstone came
down, looking harassed and anxious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew that
Charles was very desirous to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) up at once.

<p/>There was a fire in the dressing-room, and the door was open
into the little room, which was only lighted by a lamji on a
small table, where Amy was sitting at work. After sliaking
hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went away, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) alone with Charles, who lay
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) narrow bed against the wall, fixed in one position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
forehead contracted with pain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyelids red and heavy from
sleeplessness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes very quick and eager, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands and
arms thrown restlessly outside the coverings,

<p/>' I am very sorry to find you here,'' said Philip, coming up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and taking, rather than receiving, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hot, limp hand. ' Is
the pain very bad V

<p/>' That is a matter of course,'' said Charles, in a sharp, quick
manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) voice full of suliering, ' I want to hear what you
have been doing at Oxford and St. ISIildred<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am sorry I do not bring the tidings you wish.''

<p/>' I did not expect you would. I know you too well ; but I
want to hear what you have been doing -- what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said,'' answered
Charles, in short, impatient sentences.

<p/>' It can be of no use, Charlie. You are not in a state to enter
on agitating subjects.''



<p/>206 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I tell you I will hear all/ returned Charles, with increased
asperity. ' I know you will say nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) advantage that
you can help, but still I know you will speak what you think
the truth, and I want to judge for myself.''

<p/>' You speak as if I was not acting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good.*

<p/>* Palaver ! ' cried Charles, fully sensible of the advantage ^ his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
illness gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). * I want the facts. Begin at the beginning.
Sit down -- there's a chair by you. Now tell me, where did you
tind him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) r

<p/>Philip could not set Charles down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) present state, and was
obliged to submit to a cross-examination, in Avhich he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) showed no
abatement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) natural acuteness, and, unsparing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always
was, laid himself under no restraint at all. Philip was compelled
to give a full history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) researches ; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had afforded no
triumph to Guy, Cliarles revenged him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>' Pray, what did Guy say when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heard the result of this fine
voyage of discovery 1 '

<p/>' I did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again.*

<p/>^Not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ! not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so far justified ! '

<p/>*I had no time -- at least I thouglit not. It would liave
been useless, for while these mysteries continue, my opinion is
unchanged, and there was no benefit in renewing vain disputes.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more!''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Charles. <div class="bookquote">``You have said all I
expected, and more too. I gave you credit for domineering and
prejudice, now I see it is malignity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sjDoke, Laura entered from the dressing-room, and stood
aghast at the words, and then looked imj^loringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cousin.
Dr. Mayerne was following her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and Charles called out, --

<p/>' NoAv, doctor, give me as much opium as you please. I only
want to be stupefied till the world has turned round, and then
you may wake me.''

<p/>Philip shook hands with Dr. Mayerne, and, without betraying
a shade of annoyance, wished Charles good night ; but Charles
had drawn the coverings over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head, and would not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).

<p/>' Poor fellow ! ' said Philip to Laura, when they were out of
the room. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is a very generous partisan, and excitement and
suffering make him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) carry his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) zeal to excess.''

<p/>' I knew you could not be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>* I could not be angry at this time at far more provocation
given by any one belonging to you, Laura.''

<p/>Laura's heart had that sensation which the French call se
serrer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) allude to the long separation to which
there seemed no limit ; but they could say no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) after dinner,
*I am more than ever convinced that things will right them-
selves. I never saw prejudice more at fault.''

<p/>* Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tell you all about it ? '

<p/>* I worked out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) all I could, and it is my belief Guy had
the best of it. I only wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not horsewhip Philip
round the quadrangle. I wash he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 2W

<p/>' Oh, no, no ! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) controlled himself ? '

<p/>' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not we should have heard of it fast enough ; ' and
Charles told what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been able to gather, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat by,
divided between joy aciid pain.

<p/>Philip saw very little more of Charles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) used to come to
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was once a day, but never received any encour-
agement to lengthen his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) visit. These gatherings in the diseased
joint were always excessively painful, and were very long in
coming to the worst, as well as afterwards in healing ; and
througli the week of Philip's stay at Holly well, Charles was either
in a state of great suffering, or else heavy and confused with
opiates. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's whole time and thoughts were absorbed
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) attended to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) day and niglit, and could hardly
spare a moment for anything else. Indeed, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affection
and anxiety for the young lovers, Charles was so entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
engrossing object, that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) first feeling of disappointment at the
failure of Philip's journey of investigation was because it would
grieve Charlie. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not think about Guy just then, and
for Amy there was nothing for it but patience ; and, good little
creature, it was very nice to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own troubles aside,
and be so cheerful a nurse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was almost
always in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) room, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) liked to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
could not conquer a certain shrinking from Philip.

<p/>Laura had once pleaded hard and earnestly for Guy with
Philip, but all in vain ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was only taught to think the case
more hopeless than before. Laura was a very kind nurse and
sister, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could better be spared than her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother and Amy,
so that it generally fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) lot to be down-stairs, making the
drawing-room habitable. Dr. Mayerne, whenever Charles was ill,
used to be more at Holly well than at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own house, and there
were few days tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not dine there. When Amy was out
of the way, Philip used to entertain them with long accounts of
Redclyffe, how fine a place it was, how far the estate reached on
the Moorworth road, of its capacities for improvement, wastes
of moorland to be enclosed or planted, magnificent timber need-
ing nothing but thinning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke of the number of tenantry,
and the manorial rights, and the influence in both town and
county, which, in years gone by, had been proved to the utmost
in many a fierce struggle with the house of Thorndale. Sir Guy
Morville might be one of the first men in England if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) were
not wanting to himself. Mr. Edmonstone enjoyed such talk, for
it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) revel in the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own magnanimity in refusing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughter to the owner of all this ; and Laura sometimes
thought how Philip would have graced such a position, yet how
much greater it was to rest entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own merits.

<p/>' Ah, my fine fellow ! ' muttered Dr. Mayerne to himself one
day, when Philip and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle had left the room, just after a
discourse of this kind, ' I see you have not forgotten you are the
next heir.''

<p/>Laura coloured with indignation, exclaimed, ' Oh ! ' then



<p/>208 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>checked herself, as if such an aspersion was not worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)

<p/>taking the trouble to refute it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! Miss Edmonstone, I did not know you were there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>*Yes, you were talking to yourself, just as if you were at

<p/>home,'' said Charlotte, who was specially pert to the old doctor,

<p/>because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew herself to be a great pet. ' You were telling

<p/>some home truths to make Laura angry.''

<p/>* Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would make a very good use of it if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had it,'' said
the doctor.

<p/>' Now you'll make me angry,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte ; ' and you have
not mended matters with Laura. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tliinks nothing short of
four-syllabled words good enough for Philip.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Hush ! nonsense, Charlotte ! ' said Laura, much annoyed.

<p/>' There, Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is avenging herself on you because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
can't scold me,'' said the doctor, pretending to whisiDer.

<p/>* Charlotte is only growing more wild than ever for want of
mamma,'' said Laura, trying to laugh it off ; but there was so
much annoyance evident about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), that Dr. Mayerne said, --

<p/>' Seriously, I must ai^ologize for my unlucky soliloquy ; not
that I tliought I was saying much harm, for I did not by any
means say or think the Captain wished Sir Guy any ill, and few
men who stood next in succession to such a property would be
likely to forget it.''

<p/>' Yes, but rhilip is not like other men,'' said Charlotte, who,
at fourteen, had caught much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother's power of repartee,
and could be quite as jDrovoking, when unrestrained by any one
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) cared to obey.

<p/>Laura felt it was more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) dignity not to notice this, and
replied, with an effort for a laugh, --

<p/>' It must be your guilty conscience that sets you apologizing,
for you said no harm, as you observe.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mayerne</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Mayerne, good-humouredly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) does very
well without it, and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) would be one of the first men
in the country if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thompson</b></font>) had it ; but it is in very good hands now,
on the whole. I don't think, even if the lad has been tempted
into a little folly just now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) can ever go very far wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No, indeed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte ; ' but Charlie and I don't believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has done anything wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spoke in a little surly decided tone, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opinion put
an end to the matter, and Philip's return closed the discussion.

<p/>Divided as the party were between up-stairs and down -stairs,
and in the absence of Charles's shrewd observation, Philip and
Laura had more opportunity of intercourse than usual, and now
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) departure would put an end to suspicion, tliey ventured
on more openly seeking each other. It never could be the per-
fect freedom that they had enjoyed before the avowal of their
sentiments, but they had many brief conversations, giving Laura
feverish, but exquisite, delight at each renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rare expres-
sions of tenderness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you going to do to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked, on the last



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE ^09

<p/>morning before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was to leave Holly well. ' I must see you
alone before I go.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) looked down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) rather
sternly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had never before made a clandestine aj^pointment,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not like feeling ashamed of it. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) said, --

<p/>' I go to East-hill School this afternoon. I shall come away
at half-past three.''

<p/>Mary Ross was still absent ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) six nephews and nieces having
taken advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) visit to have the measles, not like rea-
sonable children, all at once, so as to be one trouble, but one
after the other, so as to keep Aunt Mary with them as long as
possible ; and Mr. Ross did not know what would have become
of the female department of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) parish but for Laura, who
worked at school-keei^ing indefatigably.

<p/>Laura had some difficulty in shaking off Charlotte's company
this afternoon, and was obliged to make the most of the proba-
bility of rain, and the dreadful dirt of the roads. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
represented it as so formidable, that Mrs. Edmonstone, who had
hardly time to look out of window, much less to go out of doors,
strongly advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to stay at home herself; and Charlotte
grew all the more eager for the fun. Luckily, however, for
Laura, Dr. Mayerne came in, laughing at the reports of the
weather ; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was wanted to prescribe for a poor old
man in an opposite direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) took Charlotte with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to
show the way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was much better pleased to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
for a companion than the grave Laura.

<p/>Philip, in the meantime, had walked all the way to Broad-
stone, timing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) return exactly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might meet Laura as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) came out of the school, and feel as if it had been by chance.
It was a gray, misty November day, and the leaves of the elm-
trees came floating round them, yellow and damp.

<p/>' You have had a wet walk,'' said Laura, as they met.

<p/>' It is not quite raining,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered ; and they proceeded for
some minutes in silence, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, -- ' It is time we should
come to an understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in alarm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice was immediately
gentler ; indeed, at times it was almost inaudible from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) strong
emotion. ' I believe that no affection has ever been stronger or
truer than ours.''

<p/>' Has been ! ' repeated Laura, in a wondering, bewildered voice.

<p/>' And is, if you are satisfied to leave things as they are.''

<p/>' I must be, if you are.''

<p/>' I will not say I am satisfied with what must be, as I am
situated ; but I felt it due to you to set the true state of the
case before you. Few would venture their love as I do mine
with you, bound in reality, though not formally, with no pro-
mise sought or given ; yet I am not more assured that I stand
here than I am that our love is for ever.''

<p/>' I am sure it is ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) repeated fervently. ' O Philip, there
never was a time I did not love you : and since that day on

<p/>P



<p/>210 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Ashen Down, I have loved you with my whole heart. I am
somethnes afraid it has left no proper room for the rest, when
I find how much more I think of your going away than of poor
Charles.''

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, ' you have understood me as none but you would
have done, through coldness and reserve, apparently, even towards
yourself, and when to others I have seemed grave and severe
beyond my years. You have never doubted, you liave recognized
the warmth within ; you have trusted your happiness to me,
and it shall be safe in my keeping, for, Laura, it is all mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' There is only one thing,'' said Laura, timidly ; ' would it not
be better if mamma knew ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laura, I have considered that, but remember you are not
bound ; I have never asked you to bind yourself. You might
marry to-morrow, and I should have no right to complain.
There is nothing to prevent you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Slie exclaimed, as if with pain.

<p/>' True,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) answered ; ' you could not, and that certainty suf-
fices me. I ask no more without your parents' consent ; but it
would be giving them and you useless distress and perplexity to
ask it now. They would object to my poverty, and we should
gain nothing ; for I would never be so selfish as to wish to
expose you to such a life as that of the wife of a poor officer ;
and an open engagement could not add to our confidence in eacli
other. We must be content to wait for my promotion. By that
time ' -- he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) smiled gravely -- ' our attachment will have lasted so
many years as to give it a claim to respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is no new thing.''

<p/>' No newer than our lives ; but remember, my Laura, that you
are but twenty.''

<p/>' You have made me feel much older,<div class="bookquote">'' sighed Laura, ' not tliat
I would be a thoughtless child again. That cannot last long,
not even for poor little Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' No one would wish to part with the deeper feelings of elder
years to regain the carelessness of childhood, even to be exempted
from the suffering that has brought them.''

<p/>' No, indeed.''

<p/>' For instance, these two years have scarcely been a time of
great happiness to you.''

<p/>' Sometimes,<div class="bookquote">'' whispered Laura, ' sometimes beyond all words,
but often dreary and oppressive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Heaven knows how unwillingly I have rendered it so. Rather
than dim the brightness of your life, I would have repressed my
own sentiments for ever.''

<p/>' But, then, where would have been my briglitness 1 '

<p/>' I would, I say, but for a peril to you. I see my fears were
unfounded. You were safe ; but in my desire to guard you from
what has come on poor Amy, my feelings, though not wont to
overpower me, carried me further than I intended.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did they r

<p/>' Do not suppose I regret it. No, no, Laura ; tliose were the
most precious moments in my life, when I drew from you those
words and looks which have been blessed in remembrance ever
since ; and doubly, knowing, as I do, that you also prize that day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes -- yes '

<p/>' In the midst of much that was adverse, and with a necessity
for a trust and self-control of wliich scarce a woman but yourself
would have been capable, you have endured nobly '

<p/>' I could bear anything, if you were not going so far away.''

<p/>' You will bear that too, Laura, and bravely. It will not be
for ever.''

<p/>' How long do you think ? '

<p/>* I cannot tell. Several years may pass before I liave my pro-
motion. It may be that I shall not see that cheek in its fresh
bloom again, but I shall find the same Laura that I left, the
same in love, and strength, and trust.''

<p/>' Ah ; I shall grow faded and gray, and you will be a sun-burnt
old soldier,'' said Laura, smiling, and looking, half sadly, half
proudly, up to his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) noble features ; ' but hearts don't change like
faces ! '

<p/>After they came near tlie house, they walked up and down the
lane for a long time, for Philip avoided a less public j^ath, in order
to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) delusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was doing nothing in an under-
hand way. It grew dark, and the fog tliickened, straightening
Laura's auburn ringlets, and hanging in dew-drops on Philip's
rough coat, but little recked they ; it was such an hour as they
had never enjoyed before. Philip had never so laid himself open,
or assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) so earnestly of the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) affection ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
thrills of ecstasy overcame the desolate expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) depar-
ture, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sensible of strength to bear seven, ten, twenty
years of loneliness and apparent neglect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
would never fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>Yet, when at last they went in-doors, and Amy followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room, wondering to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so wet, and so late, who could
have seen the two sisters without reading greater peace and
serenity in the face of the younger.

<p/>Philip felt an elder brother's interest for poor little Amy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
did not see much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) compassionated her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as a victim
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's imprudence, hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would soon be weaned
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) attachment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a good, patient little
thing, so soft and gentle as probably not to have the strength
and depth that would make the love incurable ; and the better
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), the more unfit he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for Guy. It would
have been uniting a dove and a tiger ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only fear was, that
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was no longer at hand, Mr. Edmonstone's weak good-
nature might be prevailed on to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) best
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) protection, by making his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) uncle express a resolution never
to admit Guy into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family again, unless the accusation of
gambling was completely disproved.

<p/>The last morning came, and Philip went to take leave of Charles.

<p/>P2



<p/>212 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Poor Charles was feebler by this time, and too much subdued by
pain and languor to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as at first, but the spirit was the
same ; and when Philip wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good-bye, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hoped
soon to hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was better, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) returned for answer,

<p/>* Good-bye, Philip, I hope soon to hear you are better. I had
rather have my hip than your mind.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in no condition to be answered, and Philip repeated
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good-bye, little thinking how they were to meet again.

<p/>The others were assembled in the hall. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt's eyes were
full of tears, for she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dearly, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brother's only son,
early left motherless, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had regarded like her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own child,
and who had so nobly fulfilled all the fondest hopes. All his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
overbearing ways and uncalled-for interference were forgotten,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) voice gave way as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), saying,

<p/>' God bless you, Philip, wherever you may be. We sliall miss
you very much ! '

<p/>Little Amy's hand w^as put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) squeezed it kindly ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could hardly speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ' good-bye,'' for the tears that
came, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was grieved not to feel more sorry that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
highly-esteemed cousin, so kind and condescending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), was
going away for so very long a time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte; <div class="bookquote">``I shall be quite grown
up by the time you come home.*

<p/>' Don't make such uncivil auguries. Puss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father ; but
Philip heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was holding Laura's hand in a grasp
that seemed as if it never would unclose.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>I will sing, for I am sad,

<p/>For many my misdeeds ;
It is my sadness makes me glad,

<p/>For love for sorrow pleads.-- Williams

<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) last interview with Philip, Guy returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
rooms to force himself into occupation till his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin should
come to acknowledge that here, at least, there was nothing amiss.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) trusted that when it was proved all was right in this quarter,
the prejudice with regard to the other might be diminished,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hopes were lower since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had found out the real
grounds of the accusation, reflecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should never be
able to explain without betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) waited in vain. The hour passed at which Philip's coming
was possible ; Guy was disappointed, but looked for a letter ; but
post after post failed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) one. Perhaps Philip would
write from HoUywell, or else Mr. Edmonstone would write, or at
least he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was sure that Charles would write -- Charles, whose con-
fidence and sympathy, expressed in almost dailj^ letters, had been
such a comfort. But not a line came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reviewed in memory
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) last letter to Charles, wondering whether it could have



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 213

<p/>offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; but it did not seem possible ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought over all
tliat Philip could have learnt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) visit, to see if it could by any
means have been turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disadvantage. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had done nothing to which blame could be attached ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
never infringed the rules of college discipline ; and though still
backward, and unlikely to distinguish himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) believed that
was the worst likely to have been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only wished
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) true character was as good as what would be reported of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought and wondered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grew more and more restless
and unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could imagine no reason for the silence, unless
Mr, Edmonstone had absolutely forbidden any intercourse, and it
did not seem probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) would issue any commands in a
manner to bind a grown-up son, more especially as there had
been no attempt at communication with Amy. It was terrible
thus, without warning, to be cut off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and all besides that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) loved. As long as Charles wrote, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sitting by,
perhaps sealing the letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could even tell by the kind oi
paper and envelope, whether they were sitting in the dressing-
room or down-stairs ; but now there was nothing, no assurance
of sympathy, no word of kindness ; they might all have given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) up ; those unhappy words were like a barrier, cutting him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) off
for ever from the happiness of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had once had a glimpse.
Was the Redclyffe doom of sin and sorrow really closing in upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ?

<p/>If it had not been for chapel and study, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hardly knew how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should have got through that term ; but as the end of it
approached, a feverish impatience seized on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whenever the
post came in, for a letter, if only to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) not to come to Holly-
well. None came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw nothing for it but to go to Red-
clyffe ; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dreaded seeing it in its altered state when his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
spirits were high and unbroken, how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shrink from it now !
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did, however, make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mind, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reluc-
tance almost wronged his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own beloved home. Harry Graham
wanted to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) to come and spend Christmas at his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>)
home, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Graham</b></font>) lively family, but Guy felt as if gaiety was not
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could enjoy it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not wish to drown his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
present feelings, and steadily, though gratefully, refused this as
well as one or two other friendly invitations.

<p/>After lingering in vain till tlie last day of term, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wrote to
desire that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own room and the library might be made ready
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and that ' something ' might be sent to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at
Moorworth.

<p/>Railroads had come a step nearer, even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) remote corner of
the world, in the course of the last three years ; but there was still
thirty miles of coach beyond, and these lay through a part of the
country he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had never seen before. It was for the most part bleak,
dreary moor, such as, under the cold gray wintry sky, presented
nothing to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) musings on the welcome he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) might
have been at that very moment receiving at Hollywell.

<p/>A sudden dip in the high ground made it necessary for the



<p/>214 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>coach to put on tlie drag, and thus it slowly entered a village,
which attracted attention from its wretched appearance. The
cottages, of the rough stone of the country, were little better
than hovels ; slates were torn off, windows broken. Wild-looking,
uncombed women, in garments of universal dirt colour, stood at
the doors ; ragged children ran and shrieked after the coach •
the church had a hole in the roof, and stood tottering in spite of
rude repairs ; the churchyard was trodden down by cattle, and
the whole place only resembled the pictures of Irish dilapidation.

<p/>' What miserable place is this 1 ' asked a passenger.

<p/>* Yes, that's what all gentlemen ask,<div class="bookquote">'' replied tlie coachman ;
' and well you may. There's not a more noted place for thieves
and vagabonds. They call it Coombe Prior.''

 (<font color='red'><b>all gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy well knew the name, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never been there.
It was a distant offset of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own property, and a horrible sense
of responsibility for all the crime and misery there came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there no one to look after it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the traveller</b></font>)</div>continued the traveller.
' No squire, no clergyman 1 '

<p/>' A fox-hunting parson,<div class="bookquote">'' answered the coachman ; ' wlio lives
half-a-dozen miles off, and gallops over for the service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A fox-hunting parson</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy knew that the last presentation had been sold in the days
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather's extravagance, and beheld another effect of
ancestral sin.

<p/>' Do you know who is the owner of the place 1 '

<p/>' Yes, sir ; `tis Sir Guy Morville. You have heard tell of the
old Sir Guy Morville, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) made a deal of noise in the world.''

<p/>``What! The noted '

<p/>' I ought not to allow you to finish your sentence,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy,
very courteously, ' without telling you that I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I beg your pardon ! ' exclaimed the traveller.

<p/>' Nay,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, with a smile ; ' I only thought it was fair to
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Sir Guy himself ! ' said the coachman, turning round, and
touching liis hat, anxious to do the honours of liis coach. <div class="bookquote">``I
liave not seen you on this road before, sir, for I never forget a
face ; I liope you'll often be this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>After a few more civilities, Guy M^as at liberty to attend to
tlie fresh influx of sad musings on thoughtless waste affecting not
only the destiny of the individual himself, but whole generations
besides. How many souls might it not have ruined ? ' These
sheep, what had tliey done ! ' His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfatlier had repented, but
who was to preach repentance unto these ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not wonder
now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own liopes of happiness liad been blighted ; lie only
marvelled that a bright present or future had ever been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) --

<p/>While souls were wandering far and wide,
And curses swarmed on every side.

<p/>The traveller was, meanwhile, observing the heir of Redclyffe,
possessor of wealth and wide lands. Little did he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) guess how
that bright-eyed youth looked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) riches.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 215

<p/>Miles were passed in one long melancholy musing, till Guy-
was roused by the sight of familiar scenes, and found himself
rattling over the stones of the little borough of Moorworth, with
the gray, large-windowed, old-fashioned houses, on each side,
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with friendly eyes. There, behind those limes
cut out in arches, was the commercial school, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had spent
many an hour in construing with patient Mr. Potts ; and though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Potts</b></font>) had now a juster appreciation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Potts</b></font>) old master's erudition,
whicli he (<font color='blue'><b>Potts</b></font>) had once thought so vast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Potts</b></font>) recollected with venera-
tion his (<font color='blue'><b>Potts</b></font>) long and patient submission to an irksome, uncongenial
life. Rumbling on, the coach was in the square market-place,
the odd-looking octagon market-house in the middle, and the inn
-- the respectable old <div class="bookquote">``George' -- with its long rank of stables
and out-buildings forming one side. It was at this inn that Guy
had been born, and the mistress having been the first person who
had him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) arms, considered herself privileged to have a
great affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and had delighted in the greetings he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
always exchanged with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pony at her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
stable, and went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tutor.

<p/>There was a certainty of welcome here that cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
swung himself from the roof of the coach, lifted Bustle down, and
called out to the barmaid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hoped Mrs. La vers was well.

<p/>The next moment Mrs. La vers was at the door herself, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) broad, good-humoured face, close cap, bright shawl, and
black gown, just as Guy always recollected, and might, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could, have recollected, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was born. If she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) had any
more guests she (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) neither saw nor cared for them ; her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) welcome
was all for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not but smile and look cheerful,
if only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might not disajDj^oint her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>), feeling, in very truth,
cheered and gratified by her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) cordiality. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was in a hurry,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not show it ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) to seat him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>)
own peculiar abode, behind the glass-cases of tongue and cold
chicken, told her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came from Oxford, admired her (<font color='blue'><b>barmaid</b></font>) good fire,
and warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands over it, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) even asked if the
`something' had arrived which was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) home.

<p/>It was coming to the door at the moment, and proved to be
Mr. Markham's tall, high-wheeled gig, drawn by the old white-
faced chestnut, and driven by Markham himself -- a short, sturdy,
brown-red, honest-faced old man, with frosted hair and whiskers,
an air more of a yeoman than of a lawyer ; and though not pre-
cisely gentlemanlike, yet not ungentlemanlike, as there was no
pretension about him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).

<p/>Guy darted out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and was warmly shaken by the
hand, though tlie meeting was gruff.

<p/>' So, Sir Guy ! how d'ye do ? I wonder what brings you here
on such short notice 1 Good morning, Mrs. La vers. Bad roads
this winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the coach</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Mr. Markham. It is a treat, indeed, to have
Sir Guy here once more ; so grown, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Grown-- hum ! ' said Markham, surveying him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ; ' I don't see



<p/>216 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)'ll never be as tall as his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) father. Have you got your
things, Sir Guy? Ay, that's the way, -- care for nothing but
the dog. Gone on by the coach, most likely.''

<p/>They might have been, for aught Guy knew to the contrary,
but Boots had been more attentive, and they were right. Mrs.
La vers begged he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would walk in, and warm himself ; but Mark-
ham answered, --

<p/>' What do you say, Sir Guy ? The road is shocking, and it
will be as dark as a pit by the time we get home.''

<p/>' Very well ; we won't keep old Whiteface standing,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy.
' Good-bye, Mrs. Lavers ; thank you. I shall see you again
before long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div><p/>Before Markham had finished a short private growl on the
shocking state of the Moorworth pavement, and a protest that
somebody should be called over the coals, Guy began, --

<p/>' What a horrible place Coombe Prior is ! '

<p/>* I only know I wish you had more such tenants as Todd,<div class="bookquote">'' was
Markham's answer. ' Pays his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) rent to a day, and improves his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Todd</b></font>)</div><p/>' But what sort of man is he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' A capital farmer. A regular screw, I believe ; but that is no
concern of mine.''

<p/>' There are all the cottages tumbling down.''

<p/>* Ay ? Are they ? I shouldn't wonder, for they are all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
lease ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would not lay out an unproductive farthing. And
a precious bad lot they are there, too ! There were actually
three of them poaching in ClifFstone hanger this autumn ; but
we have them in jail. A pretty pass of impudence to be coming
that distance to poach ! '

<p/>Guy used to be kindled into great wrath by the most distant
hint of jDoachers ; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cared for men, not for game ; and
instead of asking, as Markham expected, the particulars of their
apprehension, continued --

<p/>' The clergyman is that Halroyd, is he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) not ? '

<p/>' Yes ; every one knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is. I declare it went against
me to take his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) ofter for the living ; but it could not be helped.
Money must be had ; but there ! least said, soonest mended.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must mend it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, so decidedly, that Markham
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) with surprise.

<p/>' I don't see Avhat's to be done till Halroyd dies ; and then
you may give the living to whom you please. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) lives so hard
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) can't last long, that is one comfort.''

<p/>Guy sighed and pondered ; and presently Markham resumed
the conversation.

<p/>' And what has brought you home at a moment's notice 1 You
miglit as well have written two or three days before, at least.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was waiting in hoiDes of going to Holly well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy
sorrowfully.

<p/>' Well, and what is the matter ? You have not been quarrel-
ling with your guardian, I hope and trust ! Going the old way,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 217

<p/>after all ! ' exclaimed Markham, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) usual gruff, grumbling
note, but with real anxiety, and almost mournfulness.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) took up some unjust suspicion of me. I could not bear
it patiently, and said something that has offended him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).''

<p/>' Oh, Sir Guy ! luot and fiery as ever. I always told you that
hasty temper would be the ruin of you.''

<p/>' Too true ! ' said Guy, so dejectedly, that the old man instantly
grew kinder, and was displeased with Mr. Edmonstone.

<p/>' What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) have taken into his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) head to suspect you of ? '

<p/>' Of gaming at St. Mildred<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>St. Mildred</b></font>)</div><p/>* You have not ? '

<p/>* Never!''

<p/>* Then why does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) believe you 1 '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has proof against me. I can't guess how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
discovered it ; but I was obliged to pay some money to a
gambling sort of man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks I lost it.''

<p/>' Then why don't you show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) your accounts ? '

<p/>' For one reason -- because I have kept none.''

<p/>As if it was an immense relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, Markham launched
out into a discourse on the extreme folly, imprudence, and all
other evils of such carelessness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was so glad to find this
was the worst, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) lecture lasted for two miles and a half,
during which Guy, though attentive at first, had ample space
for all the thrills of recognition at each well-known spot.

<p/>There was the long green- wooded valley between the hills
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first woodcock ; there Avas the great stone
on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) best knife in a fit of geological
research ; there was the pool where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to skate ; there the
sudden break in the hills that gave the first view of the sea.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not help springing up at the sight -- pale, leaden, and
misty as it was ; and though Markham forthwith rebuked him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
for not listening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) heart was still beating as at the first sight
of a dear old friend, when that peep was far behind. More
black heaths, with stacks of peat and withered ferns. Guy was
straining his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes far off in the darkness to look for the smoke
of the old keej-RRB-er's cottage chimney, and could with difficulty
refrain from interrupting Markham to ask after the old man.

<p/>Another long hill, and then began a descent into a rich valley,
beautiful fields of young wheat, reddish soil, full of fatness, large
spreading trees with noble limbs, cottages, and cottage gardens,
very unlike poor Coombe Prior ; Markham 's house -- a perfect
little snuggery -- covered all over with choice climbing plants,
the smart plastered doctor's house, the Morville Arms, looking
honest and venerable, the church, with its disproportionately
high tower, the parsonage rather liidden behind it : and, on the
opposite side of the road, the jDark-wall and tlie gate, where old
Sarah stood, in an ecstasy of curtsies.

<p/>Guy jumped out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), and to sj-RRB-are Whiteface ; for
there was a sharp, steep bit of hill, rising from the lodge, trying
to horses, in spite of the road being cut out in long spirals. On



<p/>218 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ran, leaving the road to Markham, straight up the liigh,
steep, slippery green slope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) came in sight of the great
dark-red sandstone pile of building ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) passed it, and ran
on to where the ground rose on one side of it still more abruptly,
and at the highest point was suddenly broken away and cut off
into a perpendicular crag, descending in some parts sheer down
to the sea, in others a little broken, and giving space for
the growth of stunted brushwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) stood at the liighest
point, where the precipice was most abrupt. The sea was dashing
far beneath ; the ripple, dash, and roar were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ears once
more ; the \vind -- such wind as only blows over the sea -- was
breathing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) face ; the broad, free horizon far before him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ;
the field of waves, in gray and brown shade indeed, but still his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
own beloved waves ; the bay, shut in with rocks, and with Black
Shag Island and its train of rocks projecting far out to the west,
and almost immediately beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), to the left, the little steep
street of the fishing part of the village, nestled into the cove,
which was formed by the mouth of a little mountain-stream, and
the dozen boats it could muster rocking on the water.

<p/>Guy stood and looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could never cease looking, or
enjoying the sea air and salt breeze. It was real pleasure at
first, for there were his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) friends ; and tliough there was
a throb and tightness of heart at thinking how all was changed
but such as this, and how all must change ; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had talked
witli Amy of this very thing, and had longed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stand-
ing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) there ; yet there was more of soothing than
suffering in the sensation.

<p/>So many thoughts rushed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fancied
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had stood there a long time, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned and liastened
down again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been so rapid as to meet Markham before
the servants had had time to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).

<p/>The servants were indeed few. There was, alas ! William of
Deloraine, waiting to hold Wliiteface ; there was Arnaud, an old
Swiss, first courier and then butler to old Sir Guy ; there was
Mrs. Drew, the housekeeper, also a very old servant ; and these
were all ; but their welcome was of the heartiest, in feeling, if
not in demonstration, as the gig went with an echoing, thun-
dering sound under tlie deep archway that led into the paved
quadrangle round which the house was built, that court where,
as Philip had truly averred, the sun hardly ever shone, so high
were the walls on each side.

<p/>Up the stone steps into the spacious dark hall, and into the
large, gloomy library, partially lighted by a great wood fire,
replying to Mrs. Drew's questions about his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
room, and asking Markham to stay and dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), Guy at
length found himself at home, in the very room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
spent every evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boyhood, with the same green leather
arm-chair, in the very place where his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather used to sit.

<p/>Markham consented to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and the evening was
spent in talking over the news of Eedclyffe. Markham spoke



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 219

<p/>with much Ijitterness of the way in which Captain Morville had
taken upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) looking into the accounts, though any-
one was welcome to examine them, was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) thought, scarcely
becoming in so young a man -- the heir-at-law, too.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) can't help doing minutely whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) undertakes,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Guy. ' If you had him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) here, you would never have to scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' Heaven forbid ! ' said Markham, hastily. ' I know the same
place would not hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) and me long.''

<p/>' You have told me nothing of our new vicar. How do you
get on with him (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``None the better for that same Captain Morville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>replied
Markham, plunging forth wdth into his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) list of grievances, respect-
ing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was waging a petty warfare, in the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
was standing up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) master's rights.

<p/>Mr. Bernard, the former clergyman, had been a quiet, old-
fashioned man, very kind-hearted, but not at all active, and things
had gone on in a sleepy, droning, matter-of-fact way, which
Markham being used to, thought exactly what ought to be. Now,
Mr. Ashford was an energetic person, desirous to do liis utmost
for the parish, and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) did was an offence to Markham,
from the daily service, to the objecting to the men going out
fishing on Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) opposed every innovation with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
might, and Captain Morville's interference, which had borne
Markham down with Mr. Edmonstone's authority, had only made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) more determined not to bate an inch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) growled every time
Guy was inclined to believe Mr. Ashford in the right, and brought
out some fresh complaint. The grand controversy was at present
about the school. There was a dame's school in the cove or
fishing part of the parish, maintained at the expense of the estate,
in a small cottage far from the church, and Mr. and Mrs. Ashford
had fixed their eyes on a house in the village, and so near the
church as to be very convenient for a Sunday School. It only
wanted to be floored, and to have a partition taken down, but to
this Markham would not consent, treating it as a monstrous
proposal to take away the school from old Jenny Eobinson.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mr. Ashford meant to pension her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) off? ' said Guy.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did say something about it ', but who is to do it, I should
like to know 1 '

<p/>' We are, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>* Pay two schoolmistresses at once ! One for doing nothing !
A pretty tolerable proposal for Mr. Ashford to be making ? '

<p/>' I don't see wliy. Of course it is my business ! '

<p/>' Besides, I don't see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) is not as fit to keep school as ever

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was.''

<p/>' That may well be,'' said Guy, smiling. ' We never used to be

<p/>noted for our learning.''

<p/>* Don't you be for bringing new lights into the parish. Sir
Guy, or we shall never have any more peace.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall see about old Jenny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>answered Guy. <div class="bookquote">``As to the



<p/>220 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>house, that must be done directly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) cottage is not fit to
keep school in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Grunt, grunt ; but though a very unbending viceroy, a trmst
from the reigning baronet had a potent effect on Markham,
whether it was for good or evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) might grumble, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
never disobeyed, and the boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was used to scold and order had
found that Morville intonation of the must^ which took away all
idea of resistance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) still, however, remonstrated.

<p/>' As you please. Sir Guy, but we shall have the deer frightened,
and the iDlantations cut to pieces, if the boys from the Cove are
to be crossing the park.''

<p/>' I'll be answerable for all the damage. If they are once pro-
perly spoken to, they will be on honour to behave well. I have
seen a little of what a village school ought to be at East-hill, and
I should like to see Redclyffe like it.''

<p/>Grunt again ; and Guy found that to make Markham amiable,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) must inquire after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) nephews and nieces.

<p/>All the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had much to occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and the dreaded
sense of solitude and bereavement did not come on till he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
parted with Markham, and stood alone before the fire in the large,
gloomy room, where the light of the lamp seemed absorbed in the
darkness of the distant corners, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had scarcely been
since the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) grandfather senseless in that
very chair. How different had that room once been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) eyes,
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) happy spirits defied every association of gloom, and the
bookshelves, the carved chairs, the heavy dark-green curtains and
deep windows, were connected with merry freaks, earnest re-
searches, delightful achievements or discoveries ! Honv long ago
that time seemed ! and how changed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) !

<p/>There was a certain tendency to melancholy in Guy's mind.
High spirits, prosperity, and self-discipline, had kept it from
developing itself until the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) troubles, but since
that time it had been gradually gaining ground, and this was
a time of great suffering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forefathers'
house, and felt himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) early youth, a_ doomed man,
destined to bear the penalty of their crimes in the ruin of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dearest liopes, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heirloom of misery had but waited
to seize on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) till the very moment when it would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
the most to endure.

<p/>' But bear it I must and will ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head from
the carved chimney-piece, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been resting it. ' I have
been in will a murderer myself, and what right have I to repine
like the Israelites, with tlieir self -justifying proverb? No ; let
me be thankful that I was not given up even then, but have been
able to repent, and do a little better next time. It will be a
blessing as yet ungranted to any of us, if indeed I should bear
to the full the doom of sorrow, so that it may be vouchsafed lue
only to avoid actual guilt. Yes, Amy, your words are still with
me---<div class="bookquote">'' Sintram conquered his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) doom,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-- and it was by following
death I Welcome, then, whatever may be in store for me, were



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 221

<p/>it even a long, cheerless life without you, Amy. There is another
world ! '

<p/>With the energy of freshened resolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) candle,
and walked, with echoing steps, up the black oak staircase, along
the broad gallery, up another flight, down another passage, to
his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own room. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had expressly written ' his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own room,'' and
confirmed it on his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) arrival, or Mrs. Drew would have lodged him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) thought more suitably for the master of the house. Nothing
had been done to alter its old familiar aspect, except lighting a
Are, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had never seen there before. There were all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
boyish treasures, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bows and arrows, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) collection of birds'
wings, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wonderful weapons and contrivances, from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fire-
balloon down to the wren's-egg, all just as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) left them, their
good condition attesting the care that Mrs. Drew had taken for
his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sake.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) acquaintance with them with a sort of regretful
affection and superiority ; but there was a refreshment in these
old memories which aided thQ.new feeling of life imparted to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) resolution to bear. Nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) only to bear, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had also
to do; and before the late hour at which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fell asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had
made up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mind what was the first step to be taken about
Coombe Priory, and had remembered with rejoicing that where-
as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had regretted leaving the chapel at college which had so
comforted and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), there was now daily service at Red-
ely ffe Church. The last thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mind, before reflection was
lost in sleep, was this stanza --

<p/>Gales from Heaven, if so He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will,

<p/>Sweeter melodies may wake
On the lowly mountain rill

<p/>Than the meeting waters make.
Who hath the Father and the Son,
May be left, but not alone.



<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/>And when the solemn deep church-bell

<p/>Entreats the soul to pray,
The midnight phantoms feel the spell,

<p/>The shadows sweep away.

<p/>Down the broad Vale of Tears afar,

<p/>The spectral camp is fled ;
Faith shineth as a morning star,

<p/>Our ghastly fears are dead. -- Longfellow

<p/>Mr. Ashford was a connection of Lady Thorndale's, and it
was about a year since the living of Redclyffe had been pre-
sented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>). Mr. and Mrs. Ashford were of course anxious to
learn all they could about their young squire, on whom the wel-
fare of the parish depended, even more than in most cases, as
the whole was his (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) property. Their expectations were not raised
by Mr. Markham's strenuous opposition to all their projects, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) constant appeals to the name of ' Sir Guy ' ; but, on the other



<p/>222 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>hand, they were pleased by the strong feeling of affection that
all the villagers manifested for their landlord.

<p/>The inhabitants of EedclyfFe were a primitive race, almost all
related to each other, rough and ignorant, and with a very strong
feudal feeling for ' Sir Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' who was king, state, supreme author-
ity, in their eyes ; and Mrs. Ashford further found that ' Master
Morville,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>as the old women called him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) individual character,
was regarded by them with great personal affection.

<p/>On the occasion when Captain Morville came to Redely ffe, and
left James Tliorndale to spend a couple of hours at the parsonage,
they interrogated the latter anxiously on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) acquaintance with
Sir Guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had not the least idea of creating prejudice, indeed,
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) as a companion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) saw everything through the
medium of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) friend, and spoke something to this effect : He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was
very agreeable ; they would like his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) manners ; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was tolerably
clever, but not to be named in the same day with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) cousin for
abilities, far less in appearance. Very pleasant, generally liked,
decidedly a taking man ; but there was some cloud over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just
now -- debts, probably. Morville had been obliged to go to Ox-
ford about it ; but Mr. Thorndale did not profess to understand
it, as of course Morville said as little of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) could. Thereupon
all began to admire the aforesaid Morville, already known by
report, and whose fine countenance and sensible conversation
confirmed all that had been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>).

<p/>And as, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) interference, Mr. Mark ham's opposition be-
came surly, as well as sturdy, and Sir Guy's name was sure to
stand arrayed against them whichever way they turned, the
younger part of the family learnt to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) somewhat in
the light of an enemy, and their elders awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) majority
with more of fear than of hope.

<p/>' Mamma ! ' cried Edward Ashford, rushing in, so as to bring
the first news to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, who had not been to the early
service, ' I do believe Sir Guy is come ! '

<p/>' Sir Guy was at church ! ' shouted Robert, almost at the same
moment.

<p/>Mr. Ashford confirmed the intelligence.

<p/>' I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) speaking, after church, to some of the old men,
so afterwards I went to ask old John Barton, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes, positively trembling with delight, for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never thought to have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cheery voice again, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was coming down by and by to see the last letter from
Ben, at sea.''

<p/>' That is very nice ! Shall you call ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is only here for a day or two, it will be
better to have made the acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ashford/Ashford</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Ashford went to the Park at two in the afternoon, and
did not return till near four.

<p/>' Well,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>), ' it is as James Thorndale says, there is some-
thing very prepossessing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Have you been there all this time ? '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 223

<p/>' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was not at home ; so I left my card, and was coming
away, when I met liim at the turn leading to the Cove. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)
need not have seen me unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) had liked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) came up in a
good-natured cordial way, and thanked me for coming to call.''

<p/>' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) cousin ? '

<p/>' Not in the least ; not nearly so tall or so handsome, but with
a very pleasant face, and seeming made up of activity, very
slight, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was all bone and sinew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was going
to see the Christmas ox at the farm, and asked me to come with
liim. Presently we came to a high gate, locked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was over
it in an instant, begged me to wait while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) ran on to the farm
for the key, and was back in a second with it.''

<p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) enter on any of the disputed subjects ?''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) began himself about the school, saying the house should
be altered directly ; and talked over the whole matter very satis-
factorily ; undertook himself to speak to Jenny Robinson ; and
was very glad to hear you meant her (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) still to keep the infants at
the Cove ; so I hope that matter is in a right train.''

<p/>' If Mr. Markham will but let him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).''

<p/>* O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is king or more here ! We met Markham at the farm ;
and the first thing, after looking at the cattle. Sir Guy found
some planks lying about, and said they were the very thing for
flooring the school. Markham mentioned some barn they were
intended for, but Sir Guy said the school must be attended to
at once, and went with us to look at it. That was what kept
me so long, measuring and calculating ; and I hope it may be
begun in a week.''

<p/>' This is delightful ! What more could we wish ? '

<p/>' I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will give trouble in parish matters, and in
personal intercourse he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will be sure to be most agreeable. I
wish I knew there was nothing amiss. It seems strange for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
to come here for the vacation, instead of going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guardian's,
as usual ; and altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had an air of sadness and depression,
not like a youth, especially such an active one. I am afraid
something is wrong ; those engaging people are often unstable.
One thing I forgot to tell you. We were walking through that
belt of trees on the east side of the hill, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) suddenly called
out to ask how came the old ash-tree to be marked. Markham
answered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) gruff way, it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) doing, but the Cap-
tain's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) turned crimson, and began some angry exclamation ;
but as Markham was going on to tell something else about it,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) short, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind ! I dare say it's all
right. I don't want to hear any more ! ' And I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
spoke much again till we got into the village. _ I am afraid
there is some misunderstanding between the cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' Or more likely Mr. Markham is teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) some jealousy
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) heir. We could not expect two Captain Morvilles in one
family, and I am glad it is no worse.''

<p/>All that the Ashfords further saw of their young baronet
made an impression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) favour ; every difficulty raised by



<p/>224 THE HEIE OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>the steward disappeared ; their plans were forwarded, and they
heard of little but his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) good-nature to the poor people ; but still
they did not know how far to trust these appearances, and did
not yet venture to form an opinion on him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>), or enter into intimacy.

<p/>' So the singers will not come to us on Christmas Eve, because
they say they must go to the Park,'' said Edward, rather savagely.

<p/>' I was thinking,'' said Mrs. Ashford, ' how forlorn it will be
for that poor youth to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) Christmas-day alone in that
great house. Don't you think we might ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to dinner 1 '

<p/>Before Mr. Ashford could answer, the boys made such an
uproar at the proposal of bringing a stranger to spoil their
Christmas, that their parents gave up the idea.^

<p/>It was that Christmas-day that Guy especially dreaded, as
recalling so many contrasts both with those passed here and at
Hollywell. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been exerting himself to
attend to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) duty, going about among his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)

<p/>Seople, arranging for their good or pleasure, and spending a good
eat of time over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) studies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had written to Mr. Ross,
to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) advice about Coombe Prior, and had set Markham,
much against his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) will, to remonstrate with Farmer Todd about
the repairs ; but though there was a sort of satisfaction in doing
these things -- though the attachment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) dependants soothed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and brought a new sense of the relation between himself
and them -- though views of usefulness were on each side opening
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) -- yet there was a dreariness about everything ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
was weary even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) undertook and planned energetically ;
each new project reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) that there was no Amy to plan
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could not sufficiently care for them.

<p/>Still more dreary was his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) old haunts, and to the
scenery which he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) loved so devotedly -- the blue sea and purple
hills, which had been like comrades and playfellows, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
had known what it was to have living companions. They used
to be everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had scarcely a wish beyond ;
afterwards his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) dreams had been of longing affection for them,
and latterly the idea of seeing Amy love them and admire them
had been connected with every vision of them ; and now the
sight of the reality did but recall the sense that their charm had
departed ; they could no longer suffice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) as of old ; and
their presence brought back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), with fresh pangs of dis-
appointment, the thought of lost^ happiness and ruined hopes,
as if Amy alone could restore their value.

<p/>The depression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) spirits inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) to dwell at present
more on the melancholy history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) parents than on anything
else. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had hitherto only heard the brief narration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
grandfather, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could ask no questions ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) now ob-
tained full particulars from Markham, who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
bent on hearing all, related everything, perhaps intending it as a
warning against the passions which, when once called into force,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) dreaded to find equally ungovernable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) present master.

<p/>Mr. Morville had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) great pride and glory, and, in fact,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 225

<p/>had been so left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) care, as to have been regarded like a son
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), if possible, better than Guy,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been more his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) school,
and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all the reproofs which had ever been bestowed
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good in view • and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was never known to man. It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had ever
talked it over ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) described, with strong, deep feeling, the
noble face and bearing of the dark-eyed, gallant-looking strip-
ling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) generosity and high spirit tainted and ruined by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
wild temper and impatience of restraint. There seemed to have
been a great sweetness of disposition, excellent impulses, and so
strong a love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father, in spite of early neglect and present
resentment, as showed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have been with only
tolerable training, which gave Guy's idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) more individu-
ality than it had ever had before, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) better under-
stand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) unhappy grandfather's remorse had been. Guy
doubted for a moment whether it had not been selfish to make
Markham narrate the history of the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had suffered
so much ; and Markham, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had been led into telling it,
and saw the deepening sadness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) young master's counten-
ance, wished it had not been told, and ended by saying it was
of no use to stir up what was better forgotten.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would have regretted the telling it still more if he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
known how Guy acted it all over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) solitude ; picturing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
father standing an outcast at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own home, yielding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pride and resentment for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife, ready to do
anything, yearning for reconciliation, longing to tread once
more the friendly, familiar hall, and meeting only the angry re-
pulse and cruel taunt ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) imagined the headlong passion, the
despair, the dashing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) horse in whirlwind-like swiftness ;
then the blow -- the fall -- the awful stillness of the form carried
back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father's house, and laid on that table a dead man !
Fierce wrath -- then another world ! Guy worked himself up in
imagining the horror of the scene, till it was almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
been an actor in it.

<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never cared so much for the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father
as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) yearning for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had felt in
early days at Hollywell, had returned in double force, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) now
fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have been here to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and to
share his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grief, to be a Mrs. Edmonstone, whose love no fault
and no offence could ever cancel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rode to Moorworth, and made Mrs. La vers tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
remembered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was nothing loath, and related how she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had
been surprised by Mr. Morville arriving with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) fair, shrinking
young wife, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) coming home again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) described Mrs. Morville with beautiful blue eyes and flaxen
hair, looking pale and delicate, and with clinging caressing ways
like a little child afraid to be left.

<p/>' Poor thing ! ' said Mrs. La vers, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes ; ' when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
was going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) clung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), and cried, and was so timid



<p/>226 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>about being left, that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) called me, and begged me to
stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). It was very pretty to see
how gentle and soft he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), sharp and hasty as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was
with most ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) go, coaxing hmi not to
stay away long ; till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) on the sota, saying,
<div class="bookquote">``There, there, Marianne, that will do. Only be a good child,
and I'll come for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I never forget those words, tor they
were the last I ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) speak.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Welir , . .• u

<p/>' Poor dear ! she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cried heartily at first ; but after a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
cheered up, and quite made friends with me. I remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
told me which were Mr. Morville's favourite songs, and sang
little scraps of them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>^ • j n

<p/>' Can you remember what they were 1 eagerly exclaimed Uuy.
<div class="bookquote">``Law, no, sir; I never had no head for music. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
laughed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey to Scotland, and got into spirits only
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not bear I should go out of the room ; and after a
time she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) grew very anxious for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) to come back. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
some tea, and tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to bed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would not go,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) seemed very tired ; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said Mr. Morville would
come to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to Kedclyffe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wanted to hear ail about
the great house, listening for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) all the time, and I trying to
quiet her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) stayed the better chance
there was. Then came a call for me, and down-stairs 1 tound
everything in confusion; the news had come-- I never knew
how. I had not had time to hear it rightly myself, when there
was a terrible cry from up-stairs. Poor thing ! whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was come, or whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mmd misgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
had come after me to the head of the stairs, and heard what they
were saying. I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ever rightly knew what had
happened, for before I could get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had fainted ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
was very ill from that moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, . , ^ , , . .^

<p/>' And it was the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) died ! said Guy, looking up, atter
a long silence. ' Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)-- could she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) take any notice of me i

<p/>``No, sir ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lived but half an hour, or hardly that, after you
were born. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) it was a son ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was not able to
hear or mind me, and sank away, fainting like. I fancied I heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) say something like <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Morville,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but I don t know ; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) breath was very soon gone. Poor dear ! added Mrs -Leavers,
wiping away her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) tears. ' I grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) had been
my own child; but then I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) waking up to hear
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was dead. I little thought then. Sir Guy, that I should
ever see you stand there,-- strong and well grown i almost
thought you were dead already when I sent for Mr. Harrison to

<p/>^<div class="bookquote">``Vas ft^vou that did so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face, mournful before,
lighting up in a sudden beam of gratitude. ^``Then I have to
thank you for more than all the world besides.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Law, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lavers</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Lavers, smiling, and looking pleased,
though as if but half entering into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meaning. ' Yes, it was



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 227

<p/>in that very china bowl ; I have kept it choice ever since, and
never let it be used for anything. I thought it was making very
bold, but the doctor and all thought you could not live, and
Mr. Harrison might judge. I was very glad just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) came
that Mr. Markham came from RedclyfFe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had not been able
to leave poor Sir Guy before.''

<p/>Guy soon after set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) homeward ride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) yearning
to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother had been satisfied ; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
still love the fair, sweet vision summoned up by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was less disposed to feel that it had been hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died. It was not Amy. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tender compassion
and affection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not lost a Verena in her (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>).
None could occupy that place save Amy ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, from
custom, reverted to Amy as still his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own, thrilled like a freshly-
touched wound, and tried to realize the solace that even yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
might be praying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>It was dreariness and despondency by day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) struggled
with it by energy and occupation ; but it was something even
worse in the evening, in the dark, solitary library, where the
very size of the room gave an additional sense of loneliness ;
and in the silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could hear, through the closed shutters,
the distant plash and surge of the tide, -- a sound, of which, in
former years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never been sensible. There, evening after
evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat, -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attention roaming from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) employment to
feed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sad reflections.

<p/>One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went to the large dark dining-room, unlocked
the door, which echoed far through the house, and found his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
way through the packed-up furniture to a picture against the
wall, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) light. It was a portrait by Lely,
a half-length of a young man, one hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword, the other
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plumed hat. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark chestnut hair fell on each side
of a bright youthful face, full of life and healtli, and with eyes
which, even in painting, showed what their vividness must have
been. The countenance was full of si3irit and joy ; but the
mouth was more hard and stern than suited the rest ; and there
was something in the strong, determined grasp of the sword,
which made it seem as if the hand might be a characteristic
portrait. In the corner of the picture was the name -- ' Hugo
Morville. Mt. 20, 1671.''

<p/>Guy stood holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) light, and looking fixedly at it for a
considerable time. Strange thoughts passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind
as the pictured eyes seemed to gaze piercingly down into his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
own. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) muttered aloud, --

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), too, would liaA^e said -- <div class="bookquote">``Is thy servant a dog, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
should do this?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>;

<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had once been in a happier, better
world, with the future dawning brightly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; but as if that
once yielding to the passions inherited from that wretched man,
had brought on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the doom of misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had oj-RRB-ened the
door to the powers of evil, and must bear the penalty.

<p/>Q 2



<p/>228 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>These feelings might partly arise from its having been only
now that, had all been well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have been with Amabel ;
so that it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never hitherto appreciated the
loss. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at first comforted himself by thinking it was
better to be without her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) than to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) distress ; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
found how hard it was to miss her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)-- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bright angel. Darkness
was closing on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ; a tedious, aimless life spread out before
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ; a despair of doing good haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and with it a sense
of something like the presence of an evil spirit triumphing in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having once put himself within its grasp.

<p/>It was well for Guy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was naturally active, and had ac-
quired power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not allow himself to
brood over these thoughts by day, and in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) busied
himself as much as possible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) studies, or in going over
with Markham matters that would be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) to know
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) came to the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) property. Yet still
these thoughts would thicken on him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), in spite of himself, every
evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) sat alone in the library.

<p/>The late hours of Christmas Eve was the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
most to suffer. The day had been gloomy and snowy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
spent it almost entirely in solitude, with no companion or diver-
sion to restore the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) mind, when he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) had tried it with
hard study. He (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) tried to read, but it would not do ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) was
reduced to sit looking at the fire, recalling this time last year,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) had been cutting holly, helping the sisters to deck the
house, and in the evening enjoying a merry Christmas party
full of blitheness and glee, where there were, of course, special
recollections of Amabel.

<p/>As usual, he (<font color='blue'><b>diver</b></font>) dwelt on the contrast, mused on the estrangement
of Mrs. Edmonstone, and tormented himself about Charles's
silence, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fell into the more melancholy train of thought of
the destiny of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) race.

<p/>Far better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to bear all alone than to bring on Amy
grief and horror, such as had fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own mother ; but it
was much to bear that loneliness and desolation for a lifetime.
The brow was contracted, and the lip drawn into a resolute ex-
pression of keeping down sufibring, like that of a man enduring
acute bodily pain ; as Guy was not yielding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self --telling the tempter, who would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) give up the
struggle-- that it was only for a life, and that it was shame and
ingratitude to be faint-hearted on the very night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ought
to be rejoicing that One had come to ruin the power of the foe,
and set him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) free. But where was his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) rejoicing ? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) cheered,--
was he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) comforted ? Was not the lone, blank despondency that
had settled on him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) more heavily than ever, a token that he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) was
shut out from all that was good,-- nay, that m former years
there had been no true joy in him (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>), only enjoyment of temporal
pleasure? Had his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) best days of happiness been, then, nothing
but hollo wness and self-deception ? p . i

<p/>At that moment the sound of a Christmas carol came faintly on



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 22S

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) ear. It was one of those tunes which, when tlie village choir
were the only musicians he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) had thought unrivalled ;
and now, even to his (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) tutored, delicate ear, softened as it was by-
distance, and endeared by association, it was full of refreshing,
soothing harmony. He (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) undrew the curtain, opened the shutter,
and looked into the court, where he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) saw some figures standing.
As soon as the light shone from the window, the carol was re-
sumed, and the familiar tones were louder and harsher ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>)
loved them, with all their rudeness and dissonance, and throwing
up the window, called the singers by name, asking why they
stood out in the snow, instead of coming into the hall, as usual.

<p/>The oldest of the set came to the window to answer, -- so old
a man that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was cracked, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) performance did more
harm than good in the psalms at church.

<p/>' You see. Sir Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), ' there was some of us thought you
might not like to have us coming and singing like old times,
'cause `tis not all as it used to be here with you. Yet we didn't
like not to come at all, when you had been away so long, so we
settled just to begin, and see whether you took any notice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Thank you. It was a very kind thought, James,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy,
touched by the rough delicacy of feeling manifested by these
poor men ; ' I had rather hear the carols than anything. Come
to the front door ; I'll let you in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James Thorndale/James</b></font>)</div><p/>' Thank you, sir,'' with a most grateful touch of the hat ; and
Guy hastened to set things in order, preferring the carols to every-
thing at that moment, even though disabused of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pristine ad-
miration for James Robinson's fiddle, and for Harry Ray's grand
shake. A long space was spent in listening, and a still longer in
the endeavour to show what Mr. Ashford meant by suggesting
some improvements which they were regarding with dislike and
suspicion, till they found Sir Guy was of the same mind. In
fact, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had sung a verse or two to illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meaning,
the opinion of the choir was, that, with equal advantages. Sir
Guy might sing quite as well as Harry Ray.

<p/>It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own voice, except at
church, since the earlier days of St. Mildred's, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went up
the long stairs and galleries to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found himself still singing.
It was.

<p/>Who lives forlorn,
On God's own word doth rest,

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) path is bright

<p/>With heavenly light,
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lot among the blest.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wondered, and remembered finding music for it with Amy's
help. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sighed heavily, but the anguish of feeling, the sense of
being in the power of evil, had insensibly left him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and though
sad and oppressed, the unchangeable joy and hope of Christmas
were shedding a beam on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).

<p/>They were not gone when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) awoke, and rose to a solitary
breakfast without one Christmas greeting. The light of the other



<p/>g



<p/>230 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>life was beginning to shine out, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) see how to do and
to bear, with that hope before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The hope was becoming less
vague ; the resolution, though not more firm, yet less desponding,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would go on to grajDple with temptation, and work stead-
fastly ; and with that liope before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now felt that even a
lifetime without Amy would be endurable.

<p/>The power of rejoicing came more fully at church, and the ser-
vice entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul as it never had done before. It had
never been such happiness, though repentance and mournful feel-
ings were ever present with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ; nor was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ' Verena ' absent
from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked about between the services, saw the
oor people dining in their holly-decked houses, exchanging
hristmas wishes with them, and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) old, beautiful, bright
smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) received demonstrations of their attachment, or beheld
their enjoyment. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went home in the dark, allowed Mrs. Drew
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) own way, and serve him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and Bustle witli a dinner
sufficient for a dozen people, and was shut up for the solitary
Christmas evening which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had so much dreaded, and which
would have been esteemed a misfortune even by those who had
no sad thoughts to occupy them.

<p/>Yet when the clock struck eleven he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was surprised, and owned
that it had been more than not being unhappy. The dark fiends
of remorse and despair had not once assaulted him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), yet it had not
been by force of employment that they had been averted. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
had read and written a little, but very litlle, and the time had
chiefly been spent in a sort of day-dream, though not of a return
to Holly well, nor of what Eedclyffe might be with Amy. It had
been of a dai^kened and lonely course, yet, in another sense, neither
dark nor lonely, of a cheerless liome and round of duties, with a
true home beyond ; and still it had been a happy, refreshing
dream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began the next morning with the fresh, brightened
spirit of a man who felt that such an evening was sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
reinvigorate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energies, and fit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the immediate duties
that lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>On the breakfast-table was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen for a long
time -- a letter directed to liim. It was from ^Ir. Ross, in answer
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) question about Coombe Prior, entering readily into the
subject, and advising him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to write to the Bishop, altogether with
a tone of friendly interest which, especially as coming from one
so near Hollywell, was a great pleasure, a real Christmas treat.
There was the wonted wish of the season -- a happy Christmas--
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) took gratefully, and lastly there was a mention that
Charles Edmonstone was better, the sufiering over, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
was not yet allowed to move.

<p/>It was a new light that Charles's silence had been occasioned
by illness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) immediate resolution was to write at once to
Mr. Ivoss, to beg for further particulars. In the meantime, the
perception that there had been no estrangement was such a ray
as can hardly be imagined without knowing the despondency it
had enlivened. The truth was, perhaps, that the tone of mind



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 231

<p/>was recovering, and after having fixed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) resolution
to endure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was able to receive comfort and refreshment from
without as well as from within.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) set to work to write at once to the Bishop, as Mr. Ross
advised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) could not bear to lose time, and therefore
wrote at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) should be of age on the 28th of March, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) hoped then to be able to arrange for a stipend for a curate, if
the Bishop approved, and would kindly enter into communication
on the appointment with Mr. Halroyd, the incumbent. After
considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) letter a little while, and wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was suffi-
ciently intimate with Mr. Ashford to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) if it would do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>)
wrote another to Mr. Ross, to inquire after Charles ; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
worked for an hour at mathematics, till a message came from the
gamekeeper to ask whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would go out shooting^ whereat
Bustle, evidently understanding, jumped about, and wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
tail so imploringly, that Guy could not resist ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
books upon the top of the great pile on the sofa, and, glad that
at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could gratify dog and man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sent word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
should be ready in five minutes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not help enjoying the ecstasy of all the dogs, and,
indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was surprised to find himself fully alive to the delight
of forcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way through a furze-brake, hearing the ice in the
peaty bogs crackle beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feet ; getting a good shot, bringing
down his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bird, finding snipe, and diving into the depths of the
long, winding valleys and dingles, with the icicle-hung banks of
their streamlets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came home through the village at about
half-past three o'clock, sending the keeper to leave some of his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>)
game at the parsonage, while he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) went himself to see how the
work was getting on at the school. Mr. and Mrs. Ashford and
the boys were come on the same errand, in spite of the cloud of
dust rising from the newly-demolished lath-and-plaster partition.
The boys looked with longing eyes at the gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand, and
the half -frozen compound of black and red mud on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) gaiters ;
but they were shy, and tlieir enmity added to their shyness, so
that even when he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) shook hands with them, and spoke good-
naturedly, they did not get beyond a monosyllable.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Ashford, feeling some compunction for having
left him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) solitude so long, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) to dinner for one of
the ensuing days, with some idea of getting some one to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), and named six o'clock.

<p/>' Won't that put you out 1 Don't you always dine early ? ' said
he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>). ' If you would let me, I should like to join you at your tea-
time.''

<p/>' If you will endure a host of children,'' said Mr. Ashford.

<p/>' I should like it of all things,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' I want to make
acquaintance very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand on Robert's
shoulder. ' Besides, I want to talk to you about the singing,
and how we are to get rid of that fiddle without breaking James
Robinson's heart.''

<p/>The appointment was made, and Guy went home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hasty



<p/>232 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>dinner, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Greek, and a little refreshing return afterwards to the
books which had been the delight of younger days. There was
no renewal of the burthen of despair that had so long haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
evenings. Employments thickened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands as the days
passed on. There was further correspondence about Coombe
Prior and tlie curate, and consultations with Markham about
farmer Todd, who was as obstinate and troublesome as possible.
Guy made Markham come to Coombe Prior with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), examine
and calculate about the cottages, and fairly take up the subject,
though without much apparent chance of coming to any satisfac-
tory result. A letter came from Mr. Ross, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) even more
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had ventured to hope, for it brought a message from
Charles himself. Charles had been delighted to hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and
had begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might be told how very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been
not to write ; and how incapable he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been, and still was ; but
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hoped Guy would write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the
same mind. Mr. Ross added an account of Charles's illness, say-
ing the suffering had been more severe than usual, and had totally
disabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) for many weeks ; that they had since called in a
London surgeon, who had given him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) might be better
now than ever before, but had prescribed absolute rest for at least
six weeks longer, so that Charles was now flat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back all day,
beginning to be able to be amused, and very cheerful and patient.
The pleasure of entering into communication with Hollywell
again, and knowing that Charles at least would be glad to hear
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), was so exquisite, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was almost surprised, con-
sidering that in essentials he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was before, and even
Cliarles could not be Amy.

<p/>They hadna sailed a league, a league,

<p/>A league, but barely three,
When the lift grew dark, and the wind grew loud.

<p/>Guy's evening with the Ashfords threw down many of the
barriers in the way of intimacy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) soon made friends with the
children, beginning with the two years old baby, and ending with
gaining even the shy and sturdy Robin, who could not hold out
any longer, when it appeared that Sir Guy could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the best
place for finding sea-urchins, the present objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) affections.

<p/>' But we should have to go through the park,'' said Edward,
disconsolately, when Guy had described the locality.

<p/>``Well, why not r

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not go into the park ! ' cried the children, in chorus.

<p/>' Not go into the park ! ' exclaimed Guy, looking at Mrs.
Ashford, in amazement ; then, as it flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that it was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) part to give leave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, -- ' I did not know I was such a
dog in the manger. I thought all the parish walked iiaturally



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 233

<p/>in the park. I don't know what else it is good for. If Markham
will lock it up, I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) to give you a key.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The boys were to come the next day -- to be shown the way
to the bay of urchins, and thenceforth they became his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) constant
followers to such a degree, that their parents feared they were
very troublesome, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) assured them to the contrary ; and no
mother in the world could have found it in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart to keep
tliem away from so much happiness. There was continually a
rushing home with a joyous outcry, -- ' Mamma ! Sir Guy gave
me a ride on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) horse ! ' ' Mamma ! Sir Guy helped us to the
top of that great rock ! ' ' Oh, papa ! Sir Guy says we may
come out shooting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to-morrow, if you will let us ! '
' Mamma ! papa ! look ! Do you see ? I shot this rabbit my
own self with Sir Guy's gun ! ' ' Papa ! papa ! Sir Guy showed
us his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will take us out to the Shag Rock, if
you will give us leave ! '

<p/>This was beyond what papa, still further beyond what mamma,
could like, since the sea was often very rough in parts near the
Shag ; there were a good many sunken rocks, and boys, water,
and rocks, did not apj-RRB-ear by any means a safe conjunction, so
Mrs. Ashford put the matter off for the present by the unsea-
sonableness of the weather ; and Mr. Ashford asked one or two
of the fishermen how far they thought landing on the Shag a
jDrudent attempt.

<p/>They did not profess to have often tried, they always avoided
those rocks ; but it could hardly be very dangerous, they said,
for when Sir Guy was a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to be about there for ever,
at first with an old boatman, and afterwards alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little
boat. They had often wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was trusted there ; but if
any one knew the rocks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did.

<p/>Still, Mrs. Ashford could not make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) mind to like the idea,
and the boys came to Sir Guy in a state of great discomposure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, `perhaps we shall manage it in the
summer. We will get your father to go out with us himself ;
and, in the meantime, who likes to come with me after the
rabbits in Cliffstone Copse ? Farmer Holt will thank Robin for
killing a dozen or so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Holt</b></font>) makes grievous complaints of them.''

<p/>Guy conducted the boys out of sight of the sea, and, to con-
sole them, gave them so much more use of the gun than usual,
that it might be considered as a wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) escaped being shot.
Yet it did not prevent a few sighs being sjoent on the boating.

<p/>' Can't you forget it 1 ' said Guy, smiling. ' You have no loss,
after all, for we are likely to have no boating weather this long
time. Hark ! don't you hear the ground-swell 1 '

<p/>' What's that 1 ' said the boys, standing still to listen to the
distant surge, like a continuous low moan, or roar, far, far away,
though there was no wind, and the sea was calm.

<p/>' It is the sound that comes before stormy weather,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy.
' It is as if the sea was gathering up its forces for the tempest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But what 1 -- how ? Tell me what it really is,'' said Robin.



<p/>234 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I suppose it is the wind on the sea before it has reached us,''
said Guy. ' How solemn it is ! '

<p/>Too solemn for the boys, who began all manner of antics and
noises, by way of silencing the impression of awfulness. Guy
laughed, and joined in their fun ; but as soon as they were gone
home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood in silence for a long time, listening to the sound,
and recalling the mysterious dreams and fancies with which it
was connected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boyhood, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had never wished
thus to drive away.

<p/>The storm he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had predicted came on ; and by the evening of
the following day, sea and wind were thundering, in tlieir might,
against the foot of the crags. Guy looked from the window,
the last thing at night, and saw the stars twinkling overhead,
with that extreme brilliancy which is often seen in the intervals
of fitful storms, and which suggested thoughts that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to
sleep in a vague, soothing dream.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was wakened by one tremendous continued roar of sea,
wind, and thunder combined. Sucli was the darkness, tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could not see the form of the window, till a sheet of pale blue
liglitning brought it fully out for the moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat up, and
listened to the ' glorious voice ' that followed it, thought what
an awful night at sea, and remembered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to fancy
it would be the height of felicity to have a shipwreck at Red-
clyffe, and shocked Mrs. Bernard by inhuman wishes that a ship
would only come and be wrecked. How often had he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) watched,
through sounds like these, for a minute gun ! Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had once
actually called up jDOor Arnaud in the middle of the night for
an imaginary signal. Redclyffe Bay was a very dangerous one ;
a fine place for a wreck, with its precipitous crags, its single safe
landing-place, and the great Shag Stone, on the eastern side,
with a whole progeny of nearly sunken rocks, dreaded in rough
weather by the fishermen themselves ; but it was out of tlie
ordinary track of vessels, and there were only a few traditions
of terrible wrecks long before his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) time.

<p/>It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had worked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fancy again, for the
sound of a gun was for a moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ear. It was lost in the
rush of hail against the window, and the moaning of tlie wind
round the old house ; but presently it returned too surely to be
imaginary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sprang to the window, and the broad, flickering
glare of lightning revealed the black cliff and pale sea-line ; then
all was dark and still, while the storm was holding its breath
for the thunder-burst wliich in a few more seconds rolled over-
head, shaking door and window throughout the house. As the
awful sound died away, in a moment's lull, came the gun again.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) threw up the window, and as the blast of wind and rain
swept howling into the room, it brought another report.

<p/>To close the window, light his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) candle, throw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) clothes,
and hasten down-stairs, was the work of a very few seconds.
Luckily, the key of the boat-house was lying on the table in the
hall, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had left it, after showing the boat to the Ashford



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 235

<p/>boys ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seized it, caught up the pocket telescope, put on a
rough coat, and proceeded to undo the endless fastenings of the
hall-door, a very patience-trying occupation ; and, when com-
pleted, tlie gusts that were eddying round the house, ready to
force their way in everywliere, took advantage of the first open-
ing to blow out liis candle.

<p/>However, they had in one way done good service, for the
shower had been as brief as it was violent, and the inky cloud
was drifting away furiously towards the east, leaving the moon
visible, near her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) setting, and allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) white cold light to
shine forth, contrasting with the distant sheets of pale lightning,
growing fainter and fainter,

<p/>Guy ran across the court, round to the west side of the house,
and struggled up the slope in the face of the wind, which almost
swept him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) down again ; and when at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gained the
summit, came rushing against liim with such force that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
hardly stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did, however, keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ground, and gazed out
over the sea. The swell was fearful ; marked by the silver light
on one side, where it caught the moonbeams, and the black shade
on the other, ever alternating, so that the eye could not fix on
them for a moment ; tlie spray leapt liigh in its wliiteness, and
the Shag stood up hard, bold, and black. The waves thundered,
bursting on the cliff ; and, high as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood, the spray dashed
almost blinding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face, wliile the wind howled round him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
as if gathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
from the cliff ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood hrm, and looked out again, to dis-
cern clearly wliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had seen. It was the mast of
a vessel, seen plainly against the light silvery distance of sea
on the reef west of the Shag. It was in a slanting direction,
and did not move ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not doubt that the ship had struck
on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the bay ; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light, and made
out what objects were or were not familiar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could perceive
the ship herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked with the glass, but could see no
one on board, nor were any boats in sight ; but observing some
of tlie lesser rocks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beheld some moving figures on them.
Help !-- instant help !-- was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked towards
the Cove. Lights were in the cottage windows, and a few sounds
came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as if the fishing population were astir.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hastened to the side of the cliff, which was partly clothed
with brushwood. There was a descent-- it could hardly be called
a path -- which no one ventured to attempt but himself and a
few of the boldest birds'-nesting boys of the village ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could lose no time, and scrambling, leaping, swinging himself
by the branches, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) reached the foot of the cliff in safety, and
in five minutes more was on the little quay at the end of the
steep street of the Cove.

<p/>The quay was crowded with the fisher-people, and there was
a strange confusion of voices-- some saying all was lost ; some,
that the crew had got to the rock ; others, that some one ought



<p/>236 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>to put off and help them ; others, that a boat would never live
in such a sea ; and an old telescope was in great requisition.

<p/>Ben Robinson, a tall, hardy young man, of five-and-twenty,
wild, reckless, high-spirited and full of mischief and adventure,
was standing on a pile at the extreme verge above the foaming
water, daring the others to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) to the rescue ; and,
though Jonas Ledbury, a feeble old man, was declaring, in a
piteous tone, it was a sin and a shame to let so many poor crea-
tures be lost in sight, without one man stirring to help them ;
yet all stood irresolute, watching the white breakers dashing on
the Shag, and the high waves that swelled and rolled between.

<p/>' Do you know where the crew are ? ' exclaimed Guy, shouting
as loud as lie could, for the noise of the winds and waves was
tremendous.

<p/>' There, sir, on the flat black stone,<div class="bookquote">'' said the fortunate pos-
sessor of the telescope. ' Some ten or eleven of them, I fancy,
all huddled together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ay, ay ! ' said old Ledbury. ' Poor creatures ! there they be ;
and what is to be done, I can't say ! I never saw a boat in
sucli a sea, since the night poor Jack, my brother, was lost, and
Will Ray Avith him (<font color='blue'><b>Ray</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy wlio</b></font>)</div>said Guy, wlio had in the meantime looked
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) glass. ' How soon is high water 1 '

<p/>It was an important question, for the rocks round the Shag
were covered before full tide, even when the water was still.
There was a looking up at the moon, and tlien Guy and the
fisliermen simultaneously exclaimed, that it would be in three^
hours ; which gave scarcely an hour to spare.

<p/>Without another word, Guy sprang from the quay to the boat-
house, unlocked it, and, by example, showed that the largest
boat was to be brought out. The men helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) vigorously,
and it stood on the narrow pebbly beach, the only safe landing-
place in the whole bay ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) threw into it a coil of rope, and called
out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) clear commanding voice -- ' Five to go with me ! '

<p/>Hanging back was at an end. They were brave men, who
had wanted nothing but a leader ; and with Sir Guy at their
head, were ready for anything. Not five, but five-and-twenty
were at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) command ; and even in the hurry of the moment, a
strong, affectionate feeling filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes with tears as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw
these poor fellows ready to trust their lives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hands.

<p/>' Thank you -- thank you ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed. ' Not all, though ;
ou, Ben Robinson, Harry Ray, Charles Ray, Ben Ledbury,
^at Green.''

<p/>They were all young men, without families, such as could
best be spared ; and each, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) name was called, answered,
' Here, Sir Guy ! ' and came forward with a resolute, satisfied air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be best to have a second boat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Brown,''  (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div>to the owner of the telescope, ' will you lend yours ?
`tis the strongest and lightest. Thank you. Martin had best
steer it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knows the rocks ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) went on to name the rest



<p/>W



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 237

<p/>of the crew ; but at the last there was a moment's pause, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) doubted.

<p/>A tall athletic young fisherman took advantage of it to press
forward.

<p/>' Please your honour, Sir Guy, may not I go ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better not, Jem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jem Guy</b></font>)</div>answered Guy. <div class="bookquote">``Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>in a lower voice,
' your mother has no one but you. Here ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) called, cheerfully,
' Jack Horn, you pull a good oar ! Now, then, are we ready ? '

<p/>' All ready, -- yes, sir ! '

<p/>The boat was launched, not without great difficulty, in the
face of such a sea. The men stoutly took their oars, casting a
look forward at the rocks, then at the quay, and on the face of
their young steersman. Little they guessed the intense emotion
that swelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) breast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) took the helm, to save life or to
lose it ; enjoying the enterprise, yet with the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>)
lot might be early death ; glad it was right thus to venture,
earnest to save those who had freely trusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>), and rapidly,
though most earnestly, recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) own repentance. All this
was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) mind, though nothing Avas on his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) face but cheerful
resolution.

<p/>Night though it was, tidings of the wreck had reached the
upper part of the village ; and Mr, Ashford, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) head out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) window to learn the cause of the sounds in the street, was
informed by many voices that a ship was on the Shag reef, and
that all were lost. To hasten to the Cove to learn the truth, and
see if any assistance could yet be afforded, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) instant thought ;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had not taken many steps before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) was overtaken by a
square, sturdy figure, wrapped in an immense great-coat,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, Mr. Markham, you are on your way to see about this
wreck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>said Markham, roughly, though not with the
repellent manner usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) towards Mr. Ashford, ' I must
be there, or that boy will be in the thickest of it. Wherever is
mischief, there is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I only wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not broken his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck
long ago.''

<p/>' By mischief, you mean danger ? '

<p/>' Yes. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has not heard of this wreck, for if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has,
no power on earth would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back from it.''

<p/>Comparing the reports they had heard, the clergyman and
steward walked on, Markham's anxiety actually making him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
friendly. They reached the top of the steep street of the Cove ;
but though there was a good view of the sea from thence, they
could distinguish nothing, for another cloud was rising, and had
obscured the moon. They were soon on the quay, now still mpre
crowded, and heard the exclamations of those who were striving
to keep their eyes on the boats.

<p/>' Sir Guy ! ' exclaimed Markham. ' You don't mean he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is
gone 1 Then I am too late ! What could you be thinking of,
you old fool, Jonas, to let that bov go ? You'll never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>)



<p/>238 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>again, I can tell you, Mercy ! Here comes another squall !
There's an end of it, then ! '

<p/>Markham seemed to derive some relief from railing at the
fishermen, singly and collectively, while Mr. Ashford tried to
learn the real facts, and gather opinions as to the chance of
safety. The old fishermen held that there was frightful risk,
though the attempt was far from hopeless ; they said the young
men were all good at their oars, Sir Guy knew the rocks very
well, and tlie chief fear was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might not know how to
steer in such a sea ; but they had seen that, though daring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was not rash. They listened submissively to Mr. Markham, but
communicated in an under-tone to the vicar, how vain it would
have been to attempt to restrain Sir Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>James Robinson/Robinson</b></font>)</div>said old James Robinson, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) spoke just like the
captain of a man-of-war ; and for all Mr. Markham says, I don't
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)'d have been able to gainsay him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).''

<p/>' Your son is gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Ay, sir ; and I would not say one word to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). I know
Sir Guy won't run him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) into risk for nothing ; and I hope, please
God, if Ben comes back safe, it may be the steadying of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>).''

<p/>' Twas he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) that volunteered to go before Sir Guy came, they
say?''

<p/>' Yes, sir,'' said the old man, with a pleased yet melancholy
look. ``Ben's brave enough ; but there's the difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)'d
have done it for the lark, and to dare the rest ; but Sir Guy does
it with thought, and because it is right. I wish it may be the
steadying of Ben ! '

<p/>The shower rushed over them again, shorter and less violent
than the former one, but driving in most of the crowd, and only
lea\dng on the quay the vicar, the steward, and a few of the
most anxious fishermen. They could see nothing ; for the dark
slanting line of rain swept over the waves, joining together the
sea and thick low cloud ; and the roaring of the sea and moaning
of the wind were fearful. No one spoke, till at last the black
edges of the Shag loomed clearer, the moon began to glance
through the skirts of the cloud, and the heaving and tossing of
the sea became more discernible.

<p/>' There ! -- there ! ' shouted young Jem, the widow's son.

<p/>' The boats ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Where 1 -- where ? -- for heaven's sake ! That's nothing ! '
cried Markham.

<p/>' Yes -- yes ! I see both,'' said Jem. ' The glass ! Where's
Mr. Brown's glass ? ' _

<p/>Markham was trying to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) own, but neither hand nor eye
were steady enough ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) muttered, -- ' Hang the glass ! ' and
paced up and down in uncontrollable anxiety. Mr. Ashford
turned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>), trying to speak consolingly, and entirely
liking the old man. Markham was not ungrateful ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was
almost in despair.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 239

<p/>' It is the same over again ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>). ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is the age his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
father was, though Mr. Morville never was such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) -- never--
how should he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is the last of them -- the best -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would
have been -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was. Would to heaven I were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), that, if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is lost, we might all go together.''

<p/>' There, sir,'' called Jem, who, being forbidden to do anything
but watch, did so earnestly ; ' they be as far now as opposite
West Cove. Don't you see them, in that light place 1 '

<p/>The moon had by this time gone down, but the first great
light of dawn was beginning to fall on the tall Shag, and sliow
its fissures and dark shades, instead of leaving it one hard,
unbroken mass. Now and then Jem thought he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) saw the boats ;
but never so distinctly as to convince the watchers that they
had not been swamped among the huge waves that tumbled
and foamed in that dangerous tract.

<p/>Mr. Ashford had borrowed Markham's telescope, and was
looking towards the rock, where tlie shipwrecked crew had taken
refuge.

<p/>' There is some one out of the boat, climbing on the rocks.
Can you make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) out, Jem ? '

<p/>' I see -- I see,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Brown ; ' there are two of them. They
are climbing along the lee-side of the long ridge of rocks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ay, ay,'' said old Ledbury ; ' they can't get in a boat close to
the flat rocks, they must take out a line. Bold fellows ! '

<p/>' Where are the boats 1 ' asked Mr. Ashford.

<p/>' I can tell that,<div class="bookquote">'' said Ledbury ; ' they must have got under
the lee of the lesser Shag. There's a ring there that Sir Guy
had put in to moor his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boat to. They'll be made fast there, and
those two must be taking the rope along that ledge, so as for
the poor fellows on the rock to have a hold of, as they creep
along to where the boats are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Those broken rocks ! ' said Mr. Ashford. ' Can there be a
footing, and in such a sea ? '

<p/>' Can you give a guess who they be, sir ? ' asked Robinson,
earnestly. ' If you'd only let Jem have a look, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) could
guess.''

<p/>Markham's glass was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) service.

<p/>' Hollo ! what a sea ! I see them now. That's Ben, going
last -- I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) red cap. And the first -- why, `tis Sir Guy
himself ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be such a fool, Jem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>cried Markham, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``Sir
Guy knows better. Give me the glass.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div><p/>But when it was restored, Markham went on spying in silence,
while Brown, keeping fast possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) own telescope, com-
municated his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) observations.

<p/>``Ay, I see them. Where are they? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)'s climbing now.
There's a breaker just there, will wash them off*, as sure as they're
alive ! I don't see 'em. Yes, I do-- there's Redcap ! There's
something stirring on the rock ! '

<p/>So they watched till, after an interval, in which the boats



<p/>240 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>disappeared behind the rocks, they were seen advancing over
the waters again -- one -- yes -- both, and loaded. They came fast,
they were in sight of all, growing larger each moment, mounting
on the crest of the huge rolling waves, then plunged in the
trough so long as to seem as if they were lost, then rising --
rising high as mountains. Over the roaring waters came at
length the sound of voices, a cheer, pitched in a different key
from the thunder of wind and wave ; they almost fancied they
knew the voice that led the shout. Such a cheer as rose in
answer, from all the Redclyffe villagers, densely crowded on
quay, and beach, and every corner of standing ground !

<p/>The sun was just up, his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) beams gilded the crests of the leaping
waves, and the spray danced up, white and gay, round the tall
rocks, whose shadow was reflected in deep green, broken by the
ever-moving swell. The Shag and its attendant rocks, ana the
broken vessel, were bathed in the clear morning light ; the sky
was of a beautiful blue, with magnificent masses of dark cloud,
the edges, where touched by the sunbeams, of a pearly white ;
and across the bay, tracing behind them glittering streams of
light, came up the two boats with their freight of rescued lives.

<p/>Martin's boat was the first to touch the landing-place.

<p/>' All saved,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) said ; ' all owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>pointing back to Sir
Guy.

<p/>There was no time for questions ; the wan, drenched sailors
had to be helped on shore, and the boat hauled up out of the way.
In the meantime, Guy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) steered in past the quay, smiled and
nodded to Mr. Ashf ord and Markham, and renewed the call, ' All
safe ! ' Mr. Ashford thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) had never seen anything
l3righter than his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) face -- the eyes radiant in the morning sun, the
damp hair hanging round it, and life, energy, and promptitude
in every feature and movement.

<p/>The boat came in, the sailors were assisted out, partly by their
rescuers, partly by the spectators. Guy stood up, and, with one
foot on the seat, supported on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knee and against his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm a
little boy, round whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) great-coat was wrapped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Jem ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shouted, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) rejected volunteer, who had
been very active in bringing in the boat, ' here's something for
you to do. This poor little fellow has got a broken arm. Will
you ask your mother to take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in 1 She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s the best nurse in
the parish. And send up for Mr. Gregson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jem/Ledbury/Jem Ledbury</b></font>)</div><p/>Jem received the boy as tenderly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was given ; and, with
one bound, Guy was by the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) two friends. Mr. Ashford
shook hands with heartfelt gratulation ; Markham exclaimed, --

<p/>' There, Sir Guy, after the old fashion ! Never was man so
mad in this world ! I've done talking ! You'll never be content
till you have got your death. As if no one could do anything
without you.''

<p/>' Was it you who carried out the line on the rock ? ' said Mr.
Ashford.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ben Bobinson and I. I had often been there, after sea



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 241

<p/>anemones and weeds, and I had a rope round me, so don't be
angry, Markham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I have no more to say,'' answered Markham, ahnost surly.
' I might as well talk to a sea-gull at once. As if you had any
right to throw away your life ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I enjoyed it too much to have anything to say for myself,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy ; ' besides, we must see after these poor men. There were
two or three nearly drowned. Is no one gone for Mr. Gregson 1 '

<p/>Mr. Gregson, the doctor, was already present, and no one who
had any authority could do anything but attend to the disposal
of the shipwrecked crew, Mr. Ashford went one way, Markham
another, Guy a third ; but, between one cottage and another, Mr.
Ashford learnt some particulars. The crew had been found on a
flat rock, and the fishermen had at first thought all their perils
in vain, for it was impossible to bring the boats up, on account of
the rocks, which ran out in a long reef. Sir Guy, who knew the
place, steered to the sheltered spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been used to
make fast his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own little boat, and undertook to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way
from thence to the rock where the crew had taken refuge, carry-
ing a rope to serve as a kind of hand-rail, when fastened, from
one rock to the other. Ben insisted on sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) peril, and
they had crept along the slippery, broken reefs, lashed by the
surge, for such a distance, that the fishermen shuddered as they
spoke of the danger of being torn off by the force of the waves,
and dashed against the rocks. Notliing else could have saved the
crew. They had hardly accomplished the passage through the
rising tide, even with the aid of the rope and the guidance of Sir
Guy and Ben, and, before the boats had gone half a mile on their
return, the surge was tumbling furiously over the stones where
they had been found.

<p/>The sailors were safely disposed of, in bed, or by the fireside,
the fishers vying in services to them. Mr. Ashford went to the
cottage of Charity Ledbury, Jem's mother, to inquire for the
boy with the broken arm. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) entered the empty kitchen,
the opposite door of the stairs was opened, and Guy appeared,
stepping softly, and speaking low.

<p/>' Poor little fellow ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is just going to sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
bore it famously ! '

<p/>' The setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm 1 '

<p/>* Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite sensible, and very patient, and that old
Charity Ledbury is a capital old woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Jem are
delighted to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and will nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) excellently. How
are all the others 1 Has that poor man come to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses 1 '

<p/>' Yes. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) safe in bed at old Robinson's. The captain
is at the Browns<div class="bookquote">''.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Browns</b></font>)</div><p/>' I wonder what time of day it is ? '

<p/>' Past eight. Ah ! there is the bell beginning. I was thinking
of going to tell Master Ray we are not t6o much excited to re-
member church-going this morning ; but I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) has found it
out only ten minutes too late. I must make haste. Good-bye ! ''

<p/>R



<p/>242 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* May not I come, too, or am I too strange a figure 1 ' said
Guy, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dress, thrown on in haste, and saturated with
sea-water.

<p/>' May you 1 ' said Mr. Ashford, smiling. ' Is it wise, with all
your wet things ? '

<p/>' I am not given to colds,'' answered Guy, and they walked on
quickly for some minutes ; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, in a low voice and
hurried manner, -- ' would you make some mention of it in the
Thanksgiving 1 '

<p/>' Of course I will,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Ashford, with much emotion. * The
danger must have been great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' It w^as,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, as if the strong feeling would show itself.
' It was most merciful. That little boat felt like a toy at the
will of the winds and waves, till one recollected who held the
storm in His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke very simply, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not help it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eye
fixed on the clear eastern sky, and with a tone of g ave awe and
thankfulness which greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the com-
plete absence of self-consciousness, or from any attempt either
to magnify or depreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) sense of the danger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You thought the storm a more dangerous time than your
expedition on the rock ? '

<p/>' It was not. The fishermen, who were used to such things,
did not think much of it ; but I am glad to have been out on
such a night, if only for the magnificent sensation it gives to
realize one's own powerlessness and His (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) might. As for the rock,
there was something to do to look to one's footing, and cling on ;
no time to think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It was a desperate thing ! '

<p/>* Not so bad as it looked. One step at a time is all one wants,
you know, and that there always was. But what a fine fellow
Ben Robinson is ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) behaved like a regular hero -- it was the
thorough contempt and love of danger one reads of. There must
be a great deal of good in him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>), if one only knew how to get hold
of it.''

<p/>' Look there ! ' was Mr. Ashford's answer, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) head
at the church wicket ; and, at a short distance behind, Guy saw
Ben himself walking up the path, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thankful, happy father,
a sight that had not been seen for months, nay, for years.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, ' such a night as this, and such a good old man
as the father, could not fail to bring out all the good in a man.''

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Mr. Ashford, ' such a night, under such a leader !
The sight of so much courage based on that foundation is what
may best touch and save that man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>After church, Guy walked fast away ; Mr. Ashford went home,
made a long breakfast, having the whole story to tell, and was off
to the scene of action again, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) found the master, quite
restored, and was presently joined by Markham. Of Sir Guy,
there was no news, except that Jem Ledbury said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had looked
in after church to know how the cabin-boy was going on, and



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 243

<p/>the master, understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been the leader in the
rescue, was very anxious to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and walked up to the
house with Markham and Mr. Ashford.

<p/>Markham conducted them straight to the library, the door of
which was open. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) crossed the room, smiled, and made a sign
to Mr. Ashford, who looked in some surprise and amusement. It
has been already said that the room was so spacious that the in-
habited part looked like a little encampment by the fire, though
the round table was large, and the green leather sofa and arm-
chair were cumbrous.

<p/>However, old Sir Guy's arm-chair was never used by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grand-
son ; Markham might sit there, and Bustle did sometimes, but
Guy always used one of the unpretending, unluxurious chairs,
which were the staple of the room. This, however, was vacant,
and on the table before it stood the* remains of breakfast, a loaf
reduced to half its dimensions, an empty plate and coffee-cup.
The fire was burnt down to a single log, and on the sofa, on all
the various books with which it was strewed, lay Guy, in anything
but a comfortable position, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head on a great dictionary, fairly
overcome with sleep : his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) very thick, black eyelashes resting on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fresh, bright cheek, and the relaxation of the grave expression
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) features making him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) look even younger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) really was.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so sound asleep that it was not till some movement of
Markham's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) awoke, and started up, exclaiming, --

<p/>' What a horrid shame ! I am very sorry ! ''

<p/>' Sorry ! what for ? ' said Markham. ' I am glad, at any rate,
you have been wise enough to change your things, and eat some
breakfast.''

<p/>' I meant to have done so much,'' said Guy ; ' but sea- wind
makes one so sleepy ! ' Then, perceiving the captain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came
forward, hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite recovered.

<p/>The captain stood mystified, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not believe this slim
youth could be the Sir Guy of whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had heard so much,
and, after answering the inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began, --

<p/>' If I could have the honour of seeing Sir Guy '

<p/>' Well r said Guy.

<p/>' I beg your pardon, sir ! ' said the captain, while they all
laughed, ' I did not guess you could be so young a gentleman. I
am sure, sir, `tis what any man might be proud of having done,

<p/>and 1 never saw anything like it ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, with a fresh

<p/>start, ' and it will do you honour everywhere. All our lives are
owing to you, sir.''

<p/>Guy did not cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) short, though very glad when it was over.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should not, in the captain's place, like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
thanks shortened, and besides, if ever there was happiness or
exultation, it was in the glistening eyes of old Markham, the first
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had ever been able to be justly proud of one of the family,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) loved with so much faithfulness and devotion.

<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>Is there a word, or jest, or game,

<p/>But time encrustetli round
With sad associate thoughts the same?

<p/>Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

<p/>Among the persons who spent a forlorn autumn was Mr.
Koss, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) troubles were not quite of the same descrip-
tion as those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) young parishioners. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughter
very much ; all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) household affairs got out of order ; the
school-girls w^ere naughty, and neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), nor Miss Edmonstone,
nor the mistress, could discover the culprits ; their inquiries pro-
duced nothing but a wild confusion of mutual accusations, where
the truth was undistinguishable. The cook never could find
anything to make broth of ; Mr. Ross could never lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) hands
on the books he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) wanted for himself or anybody else ; and, lastly,
none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) shirts ever had their buttons on.

<p/>Mary, meanwhile, had to remain through a whole course of
measles, then to greet the arrival of a new nephew, and to attend
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) christening : but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made a vow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be at
home by Christmas, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) kept it.

<p/>Mr. Ross had the satisfaction of fetching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) home from the
station the day before Christmas Eve, and of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opposite
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own side of the table, in the evening, putting on
the buttons, and considering it an especial favour and kindness,
for which to be for ever grateful, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had written all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
Christmas sermons beforehand, so as to have a whole evening clear
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) was never a great letter-writer, and Mary had a
great deal to hear, for all that had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were the main
facts, with very few details.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had very few letters, even from Hollywell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
' I suppose it is on account of Charles's illness. You think him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
really better ? '

<p/>' Yes, much better. I forgot to tell you, you are wanted for
their Christmas party to-morrow night.''

<p/>' Oh ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is well enough for them not to put it off ! Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) able
to be out of bed 1 '

<p/>* No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lies perfectly flat, and looks very thin. It has been
a very severe illness. I don't think I ever knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) suffer so
much ; but, at the same time, I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) behave so well,
or show so much patience, and consideration for other people.
I was the more surprised, because at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed to have
relapsed into all the ways he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had shaken off ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
so irritable and fretful, that poor Mrs. Edmonstone looked worn
out ; but it seems to have been only the beginning of the illness ;
it was very different after he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was laid up.''

<p/>* Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had you to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>* Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked for it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never did before, and Amabel
reads to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) every morningc There is certainly much more that



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE. 245

<p/>is satisfactory about those young Edmonstones than there once
seemed reason to expect.''

<p/>' And now tell me about Sir Guy. What is the matter ? Why
does he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not come home this winter 1 '

<p/>' I cannot tell you the rights of it, Mary. Mr. Edmonstone is
very much offended about something he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is reported to have said,
and suspects him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) of having been in mischief at St. Mildred's ; but
I am not at all persuaded that it is not one of Mr. Edmonstone's
affronts.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)

<p/>' At Redclyffe. I have a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) which I am going
to answer to-night. I shall tell the Edmonstones about it, for
I cannot believe that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had been guilty of anything very
wrong, his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) mind would be occupied in this manner ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
gave Mary the letter.

<p/>' Oh, no ! ' exclaimed Mary, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) read. ' I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) cannot
be in any mischief. What an admirable person he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is ! I am
very sorry this cloud has arisen ! I was thinking last summer
how happy they all were together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Either this or Charles's illness has cast a gloom over the
whole house. The girls are both grown much graver.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Amy graver ? ' said Mary, quickly.

<p/>' I think so. At least she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not seem to cheer up as I should
have expected when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother grew better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looks as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been nursing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) too closely, and yet I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walking
a good deal.''

<p/>' Poor little Amy ! ' said Mary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) asked no more ques-
tions, but was anxious to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own observations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not see the Edmonstones till the next evening, as the
day was wet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only received a little note telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that
the carriage would be sent to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Mr. Ross. The whole
of the family, except Charles, were in the drawing-room, but
Mary looked chiefly at Amy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in white, with holly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
hair, and did not look sorrowful ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was paler and thinner
than last summer, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke, smiled, and laughed
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought, it was without the gay, childish freedom of
former times. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a small, pale, quiet girl now, not a merry,
caressing kitten. Mary recollected what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been in the wood
last summer, and was sure it was more than Charles's illness that
had altered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ; yet still Amy had not Laura's harassed look.

<p/>Mary had not much talk with Amy, for it was a large party,
with a good many young ladies and children, and Amy had a
great deal of work in the way of amusing them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had a
wearied look, and was evidently exerting herself to the utmost.

<p/>' You look tired,'' said Mary, kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is only stupidity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, smiling rather sadly.
<div class="bookquote">``We can't be entertaining without Charlie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It has been a melancholy winter,'' began Mary, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
surprised, for Amy's face and neck coloured in a moment ; then,
recovering herself, with some hesitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, --



<p/>246 • THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>, ' Oh ! but Charlie is much better, and that is a great comfort.
I am glad you are come home, Mary.''

<p/>* We are going to have some magic music,'' was said at the
other end of the room. ' Wlio will play 1 '

<p/>' Little Amy ! ' said Mr. Edmonstone. ' Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) 1 She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
always does it to admiration. Amy, come and be a performer.''

<p/>Amy rose, and came forward, but the colour had flushed into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cheeks again, and the recollection occurred to Mary, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
fame as a performer, in that way, arose from the very amusing
manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Sir Guy had conducted the game last
year. At the same moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother met her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and whispered, --

<p/>' Had you rather not, my dear ? '

<p/>' I can do it, mamma, thank you -- never mind.''

<p/>' I should like to send you up to Charlie -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has been so long
alone.''

<p/>' Oh ! thank you, dear mamma,'' with a look of relief.

<p/>' Here is Charlotte wild to be a musician,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmon-
stone. ' Perhaps you will see liow she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) can manage ; for I think
Charles must want a visit from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) little nurse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a musician</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy moved quietly away, and entered Charles's room, full of
warm gratitude for the kindness which was always seeking how
to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>Charles was asleep, and throwing a shawl round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat
down in the dim light of the lamp, relieved by the stillness, only
broken by now and then a louder note of the music down-stairs.
It was very comfortable, after all that buzz of talk, and the jokes
that seemed so nonsensical and tiresome. There were but two
people who could manage to make a party entertaining, and that
was the reason it was so different last year. Then Amy wondered
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was the only person who felt sick at heart and dreary ; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only wondered for a moment -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) murmured half aloud to
herself, ' I said I never would think of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) except at my prayers !
Here I am doing it again, and on Christmas night. I won't
hide my eyes and moan over my broken reed ; for Christmas
is come, and the circles of song are widening round ! Glory !
good will, peace on earth ! How he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sang it last year, the last
thing, when the people were gone, before we went up to bed.
But I am breaking my resolution again. I must do something.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took up a book of sacred poetry, and began to learn a
piece which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) already nearly knew ; but the light was bad,
and it was dreamy work ; and x^robably she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was half asleep, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thoughts wandered off to Sintram and the castle on the
Mondenfelsen, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) like what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had pictured
the Redclyffe crags, and the castle itself was connected in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
imagination with the deep, echoing porch, while Guy's own
voice seemed to be chanting --

<p/>Who lives forlorn,
On God's own word doth rest;
His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) path is bright
With heavenly light,
' His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lot among the blest.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 247

<p/>* Are you there, Amy ? ' said Charles, waking. ' What are you
staying here for ? Don't they want you ? '

<p/>' Mamma was so kind as to send me up.''

<p/>' I am glad you are come, for I have something to tell you.
Mr. Ross has been up to see me, you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) has a letter
from Guy.<div class="bookquote">'' Amy's heart beat fast, and, with eyes fixed on the
ground, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) listened as Charles continued to give an account of
Guy's letter about Coombe Prior. ' Mr. Ross is quite satisfied
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>). Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) concluded. ' I wish you could have heard
the decided way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) will live it down.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>Amy's answer was to stoop down and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother's forehead.

<p/>Another week brought Guy's renewal of the correspondence.

<p/>' Amy, here is something for you to read,'' said Charles, holding
up the letter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came into the room.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew the writing. ' Wait one moment, Charlie, dear ; '
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran out of the room, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother fortunately alone,
and said, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face, -- <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, dear, do you think I
ought to let Charlie show me that letter ? '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone took hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hand, and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) round
so as to look into the face through its veiling curls. The hand
shook, and the face was in a glow of eagerness. ' Yes, dearest ! '
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not help it ; and then, as Amy ran back
again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) asked herself whether it was foolish, and bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sweet little daughter ; then declared to herself that it must -- it
should -- it would come right.

<p/>There was not a word of Amy in the letter, but it, or some-
thing else, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more bright and cheerful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been
for some time past. It seemed as if the lengthening days of Janu-
ary were bringing renewed comfort with them, when Charles,
who ever since October had been confined to bed, was able to
wear the Chinese dressing-gown, be lifted to a couch, and wheeled
into the dressing-room, still prostrate, but much enjoying the
change of scene, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called coming into the world.

<p/>These were the events at quiet HoUywell, while Redclyfie was
still engrossed with the shipwreck, which seemed to have come
on purpose to enliven and occupy this solitary winter. It per-
plexed the Ashfords about their baronet more than ever. Mr.
Ashford said that no one whose conscience was not clear could
have confronted danger as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) had done ; and yet the certainty
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) was under a cloud, and the sadness, so inconsistent with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) age and temperament, still puzzled them. Mrs. Ashford
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) had made a discovery. The second day after the
wreck, the whole crew, except the little cabin-boy, were going to
set off''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>to the nearest sea-port ; and the evening preceding their
departure, they were to meet their rescuers, the fishermen, at a
supper in the great servants' hall at the park. Edward and
Robert were in great glory, bringing in huge branches of ever-
greens to embellish the clean, cold place ; and Mr. and Mrs.
Ashford and Grace were to come to see the entertainment, after
having some cofiee in the library.



<p/>248 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Guy prepared it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) company by tumbling his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) books head-
long from the sofa to a more remote ottoman, sticking a bit of
holly on the mantel-shelf, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beloved old friend,
Strutt's ' Sports and Pastimes,^ to amuse Grace, and making up
an immense lire ; and then, looking round, thought the room
was uncommonly comfortable ; but the first thing that struck
Mrs. Ashford, when, with face beaming welcome, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>)
in from the great hall, was, how forlorn rooms looked that had
not a woman to inhabit them.

<p/>The supper went off with great eclat. Arnaud at the head
of the table carved with foreign courtesies, contrasted with the
downright bluff way of the sailors. As soon as Sir Guy brought
Mrs. Ashford to look in on them, old James Robinson proposed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) health, with hopes he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) would soon come and live among them
for good ; and Jonas Ledbury added another wish, that ' Lady
Morville ' might soon be there too. At these words, an expres-
sion of pain came upon Guy's face ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips were rigidly pressed
together ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned hastily away, and paced up and down before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could command his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) countenance. All were so bus^ cheering,
that no one heeded his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) change of demeanour save Mrs. Ashford ;
and though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) returned to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been
standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) complexion was deepened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lip quivered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
voice trembled in returning thanks, Mr. Ashford only saw tlie
emotion naturally excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) people's attachment.

<p/>The lady understood it better ; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked it over
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband in the evening, they were convinced the cause
of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trouble must be some unfortunate attachment, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might think it his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) duty to overcome ; and having settled this,
they became very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and anxious to make Redclyffe
agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>Captain and crew departed ; the little boy was better, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
hosts. Charity and Jem Ledbury, only wished to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) for
ever ; the sensation at Redclyffe was subsiding, when one morning
Markham came, in a state of extreme satisfaction and import-
ance, to exhibit the county paper, with a full account of the
gallant conduct of the youthful baronet. Two or three days
after, on coming home from a ride to Coombe Prior, Guy found
Lord Thorndale's card, and heard from Arnaud that ' my lord
had made particular inquiries how long he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) would be in the
country, and had been to the cliff to see where the wreck was.''

<p/>Markham likewise attached great importance to this visit, and
went off into a long story about his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) influence, and the repre-
sentation of Moorworth, or even of the county. As soon as Guy
knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was talking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed, ' Oh, I hope all
that is not coming on me yet ! Till I can manage Todd and
Coombe Prior, I am sure I am not fit to manage the country ! '

<p/>A few mornings after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) found on the table an envelope,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) studied, as if playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) eagerness. It had an
East-hill post-mark, and a general air of Holly well writing, but
it was not in the hand of either of the gentlemen, nor was the



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 249

<p/>tail of the y such as Mrs. Edmonstone was wont to make. It
liad even a resemblance to Amabel's own writing, that startled
liim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) opened it at last, and within found the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) could
not doubt-- Charles's, namely -- much more crooked than usual,
and the words shortened and blotted :--

<p/>``Dear G.,-- I ought not to do this, but I must; I have
tyrannized over Charlotte, and obtained the where\yithal. Write
me a full account of your gallant conduct. I saw it first in A.<div class="bookquote">``s
face. It has done you great good with my father. I will write
more wlien I can. I can't get on now. ' C. M. E.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) might well say he (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) had first seen it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) sister's face.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) the paper, and was looking for something
he (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>), when ' RedclyfFe Bay ' met her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eye,
and then came the whole at one delightful glance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) saw the
heightened colour, the exquisite smile, the tear-drop on the
eyelash.

<p/>' Amy ! what have you there % '

<p/>vShe pointed to the place, gave the paper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) hand, and
burst into tears, the gush of triumphant feeling. Not one was
shed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was divided from the hero of the shipwreck ;
they were pure unselfish tears of joy, exultation, and thankfulness.
Charles read the history, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) listened in silence ; then looked
it over again with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and betrayed how thoroughly she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had
been taught the whole geography of Eedclyfie Bay. The next
person who came in was Charlotte ; and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) under-
stood what occupied them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went into an ecstasy, and flew
away with the paper, rushing with it straight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father's
room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) broke into the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letter-writing, by
reading it in a voice of triumph.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone was delighted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was just the person who
would be far more taken with an exploit of this kind, such as
would make a figure in the world, than by steady perseverance
in well-doing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) heart was won directly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wrath at the
hasty words had long been diminishing, and now was absolutely
lost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) admiration. ' Fine fellow ! noble fellow ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said.
' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is the bravest boy I ever heard of ; but I knew what was in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) from the first. I wish from my heart there was not this
cloud over him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>). I am sure the whole story has not a word of
truth in it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) won't say a word to clear himself, or else we
would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) here again to-morrow.''

<p/>This was the first time Mr. Edmonstone had expressed any-
thing of real desire to recall Guy, and it was what Charles meant
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letter.

<p/>The tyranny over Charlotte was exercised while the rest were
at dinner, and they Avere alone together. They talked over the
adventure for the tenth time tliat day, and Charles grew so
excited that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must at once write to Guy ;
ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) the materials, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hesitated,



<p/>250 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) into it, by declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should get up and reach
the things himself, which would be a great deal worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
wanted to write from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dictation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not consent,
thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother might not consider it proper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
began vigorously ; but though long used to writing in a recum-
bent posture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found himself less capable now than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
expected, and went on soliloquizing thus : ' What a pen you've
given me, Charlotte. There goes a blot ! Here, another dip,
will you ! and take up that with the blotting paper before it
becomes more like a spider.''

<p/>' Won't you make a fresh beginning ? '

<p/>' No, that has cost me too much already. I've got no more
command over my fingers. Here we go into the further corner
of the paper. Well ! C. M. E. There `tis-- do it up, will you 1
If he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) can read it he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll be lucky. How my arms ache ! '

<p/>' I hope it has not hurt you, Charlie ; but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) will
be very glad of it. O ! I am glad you said that about Amy.''

<p/>' Who told you to read it. Puss 1 '

<p/>' I could not help it, `tis so large.''

<p/>' I believe I didn't ought to have said it. Don't tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) I did/
said Charles ; ' but I couldn't for the life of me -- or what is
more to the purpose, for the trouble of it -- help putting it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
is too true a knight not to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lady, not exactly smiled,
but cried.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a true knight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, emphatically, as with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) best pen, and with infinite satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) indited the
*Sir Guy Morville, Bart., Redclyfie Park, Moorworth,'' only
wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could lengthen out the words infinitely.

<p/>' Do you remember, Charlie, how we sat here the first evening
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) came, and you took me in about the deadly feud ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was no take-in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; `only the feud is all on one
side.''

<p/>' Oh, dear ! it has been such a stupid winter without Guy,<div class="bookquote">''
sighed Charlotte ; ' if this won't make papa forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), I don't
know what will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>* I wish it would, with all my heart,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' but
logically, if you understand the word, Charlotte, it does not
make much difference to the accusation. It would not exactly
be received as exculpatory evidence in a court of justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' You don't believe the horrid stories 1 '

<p/>' I believe that Guy has gamed quite as much as I have myself ;
but I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cleared beyond the power of Philip to
gainsay or disbelieve it. I should like to have such a force of
proof as would annihilate Philip ; and if I was anything but
what I am, I would have it. If you could but lend me a leg for
two days, Charlotte.''

<p/>' I wish I could.''

<p/>' One thing shall be done,<div class="bookquote">'' proceeded Charles : ' my father
shall go and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in person when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comes of age. Now
Don Philip is out of the way, I trust I can bring that about.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLVFFE 251

<p/>' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would but come here ! '

<p/>' No, that must not be, as mamma says, till there is some
explanation ; but if I was but in my usual state, I would go with
papa and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) in London. I wonder if there is any chance
of it. The 28th of March -- ten weeks off! If I can but get
hold of those trusty crutches of mine by that time I'll do, and
I'll do, and I'll do. We will bring back Amy's knight with
flying colours.''

<p/>', Oh, how happy we should be ! '

<p/>' If I only knew what sort of sense that Markham of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) may
liave, I would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) a hint, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) to ferret out at St.
Mildred's. Or shall I get Dr. Mayerne to order me there for
change of air ? '

<p/>So schemed Charles ; while Gruy, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) side, busied himself
at RedclyfFe as usual ; took care and thought for the cabin-boy
-- returned Lord Thorndale's call without finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at home --
saw the school finished, and opened -- and became more intimate
with the Ashfords.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) should not come home at Easter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) should
be very busy reading for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) degree ; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) birthday this
year fell in Holy Week, there could be no rejoicings ; besides, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was not to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) property in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own hands till he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was
five-and-twenty, it would make no difTerence to the people. The
Ashfords agreed they had rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was safe at home for the
vacation, and were somewhat anxious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) spoke of coming
home to settle, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) degree.

<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own part he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was glad the season would prevent any
rejoicings, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was in no frame of mind to enter into them,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) birthday had been so sad a day for liis grandfather, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had no associations of pleasure connected with it.

<p/>Markliam understood the feeling, liked it, and shared it, only
saying that they would have their day of rejoicing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
married. Guy could not answer, and the old steward remarked
the look of pain.

<p/>' Sir Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), ' is it that which is wrong with you ?
Don't be angry with an old man for asking the question, but I
only would hope and trust you are not getting into any scrape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' Thank you, Markham,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, after an effort ; ' I cannot
tell you about it. I will only set you at rest by saying it is
nothing you could think I ought to be ashamed of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why -- what has come between? What could man or
woman object to in you 1 ' said Markham, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) proudly.

<p/>' These unhappy suspicions,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Guy.

<p/>' I can't make it out,<div class="bookquote">'' said Markham. ' You must have been
doing something foolish to give rise to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy told nearly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had said on the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
return, but nothing could be done towards clearing up the
mystery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) returned to Oxford as usual.

<p/>March commenced, and Charles, though no longer absolutely
recumbent, and able to write letters again, could not yet attempt



<p/>252 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE.

<p/>to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) crutches, so that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) designs vanished, except that
of persuading his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father to go to London to meet Guy and
Markham there, and transact the business consequent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
ward's attaining liis majority. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) trusted much to Guy's
personal influence, and said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father, ' You know no one has
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) yet but Philip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would tell things to you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
might not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>It was an argument that delighted Mr. Edmonstone.
' Of course I have more weight and experience, and -- and poor
Guy is very fond of us. Eh, Charlie 1 '

<p/>So Charles wrote to make an appointment for Guy to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
guardian and Markham in London on Easter Tuesday. ' If you
will clear up the gambling story,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wrote, `all may yet be well.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>Guy sighed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) laid aside the letter. <div class="bookquote">``All in vain, kind
Charlie,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to himself, ' vain as are my attempts to keep
my poor uncle from sinking himself further ! Is it fair, though,<div class="bookquote">''
continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), with vehemence, `that the happiness of at least
one life should be sacrificed to hide one step in the ruin of a man
who will not let himself be saved ? Is it not a waste of self-
devotion '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? Have I any right to sacrifice hers? Ought I not
rather' -- and a flash of joy came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -- `to make my uncle
give me back my promise of concealment ? I can make it up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). It cannot injure him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), since only the Edmonstones will
know it ! But ' -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lips firmly together -- ' is
this the spirit I have been struggling for this whole winter 1
Did I not see tliat patient waiting and yielding is fit penance
for my violence. It would be ungenerous. I will wait and bear,
contented that Heaven knows my innocence at least in this.
For her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), when at my best I dreaded that my love might bring
sorrow on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) -- how much more now, when I have seen my
doom face to face, and when the first step towards her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would
be what I cannot openly and absolutely declare to be right !
That would be the very means of bringing the sufiering on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
and I should deserve it.''

<p/>Guy quitted these thoughts to write to Markham to make
the appointment, finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) letter Avitli a request that Mark-
ham would stop at St. Mildred's on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way to London, and pay
Miss Wellwood, the lady with whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle's daughter was
placed, for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quarter's board. ' I hoioe this will not be a very
troublesome request,<div class="bookquote">'' wrote Guy ; ' but I know you had rather I
did it in this way, than disobey your maxims, as to not sending
money by the post.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The time before the day of meeting was spent in strengthening
himself against the pain it would be to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confidence to
Mr. Edmonstone, and thus to throw away the last chance of
reconciliation, and of Amy. This would be the bitterest pang
of all -- to see them ready to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forced to reject
their kindness.

<p/>So passed the preceding week, and with it his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) twenty-first
birthday, spent very differently from the way in which it would



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 253

<p/>ordinarily be passed by a youth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) position. It went by in
hard study and sad musings, in bracing himself to a resolution
that would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held dear, and, as the only means of
so bracing himself, in trying to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gaze more steadily beyond
the earth.

<p/>Easter day steadied the gaze once more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and as the
past week had nerved him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the spirit of self-sacrifice, the feast
day brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) true unchanging joy, shining out of sadness,
and enlightening the path that would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to keep liis reso-
lution to the utmost, and endure the want of earthly hope.



<p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>Alrecady in thy spirit thus divine,
Whatever weal or woe betide,
Be that high sense of duty still thy guide,

<p/>And all good powers will aid a soul like thine.-- Southey

<p/>' Now for it ! ' thought Guy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dismissed liis cab, and
was shown up-stairs in the hotel. <div class="bookquote">``Give me the strength to
withstand ! '

<p/>The door was opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) beheld Mr. Edmonstone, Mark-
ham, and another -- it surely was Sebastian Dixon ! All sprung
up to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) ; and Mr. Edmonstone, seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) by both
hands, exclaimed --

<p/>* Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is himself ! Guy, my boy, my dear boy, you are the
most generous fellow in the world ! You have been used abomin-
ably. I wish my two hands had been cut off before I was
persuaded to write that letter ; but it is all right now. Forget
and forgive -- eh, Guy? You'll come home with me, and we
will write this very day for Deloraine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy was almost giddy with surprise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held one of Mr.
Edmonstone's hands, and pressed it hard ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes, as if in a dream. ' All right 1 ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>' All right ! ' said Mr. Edmonstone. ' I know where your
money went, and I honour you for it ; and there stands the man
who told me the whole story. I said, from the first, it was a
confounded slander. It was all owing to the little girl.''

<p/>Guy turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face in amazement towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, who was
only waiting to explain. ``Never till this morning had I the
least suspicion that I had been the means of bringing you under
any imputation. How could you keep me in ignorance ? '

<p/>' You have told '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the cheque,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>broke in Mr. Edmonstone, `and of all the
rest, and of your providing for the little girl. How could you
do it with that pittance of an allowance of yours ? And Master
Philip saying you never had any money ! No wonder, indeed ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had known you were pinching yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dixon/Mr. Dixon</b></font>)</div>said Dixon,
* my mind would have revolted '

<p/>' Let me understand it.'' said Guy, grasping the back of a chair



<p/>254 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>*Tell me, Markham. Is it really so? Am 1 cleared? Has
Mr. Edmonstone a right to be satisfied ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Sir Guy/ was Markham's direct answer. *Mr. Dixon
has accounted for your disposal of the thirty pound cheque, and
there is an end of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy drew a long breath, and the convulsive grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
fingers relaxed.

<p/>' I cannot thank you enough ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle ; then to
Mr. Edmonstone, ' how is Charles ? '

<p/>' Better-- much better, you shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to-morrow-- eh, Guy ? '

<p/>* But I cannot explain about the one thousand pounds.''

<p/>' Never mind -- you never had it, so you can't have misspent
it. That's neither here nor there<div class="bookquote">''.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' And you forgive my language respecting you.''

<p/>' Nonsense about that ! If you never said anything worse
than that Philip was a meddling coxcomb, you haven't much to
repent of ; and I am sure I was ten old fools when I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
bore me into writing that letter.''

<p/>' No, no ; you did right under your belief ; and circumstances
were strong against me. And is it clear? Are we where we
were before?''

<p/>' We are -- we are in everything ; only we know better what
you are worth, Guy. Shake hands once more. There's an end
of all misunderstanding and vexation, and we shall be all right
at home again ! '

<p/>The shake was a mighty one, Guy shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face for a
moment or two, and then said --

<p/>' It is too much. I don't understand it. How did you know
this matter wanted explanation ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>``I learnt it from Mr. Markham, and you will do me the
justice to believe, that I was greatly shocked to find that your
generosity '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth of the matter is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>said Markham. <div class="bookquote">``You sent
me to Miss Wellwood's, at St. Mildred's. The principal was not
within, and while waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) to make the payment, I got
into conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) sister. Miss Jane. She (<font color='blue'><b>'s</b></font>) told me that the
child, Mr. Dixon's daughter, was always talking of your kindness,
especially of a morning at St. Mildred's, when you helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) in
some difficulty. I thought this threw some light on the matter,
found out Mr. Dixon this morning, and you see the result.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I do, indeed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' I wish I could attempt to thank
you all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks enough for me to see you look like yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>said
Markham. ' Did you think I was going to sit still and leave
you in the mess you had got yourself into, with your irregularity
about keeping your accounts ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, as if it was
especially pleasant to be obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). ' You never can guess
what I owe to you ! '

<p/>' Nay, I deserve no thanks at all,'' said Sebastian, ' since I was



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 255

<p/>the means of bringing the imputation on you ; and I am sure it
is enough for a wretch like me, not to have brought only misery
wherever I turn -- to have done something to repair the evil I
have caused. Oh, could I but bring back your father to what
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was when first I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as you are now ! '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was getting into one of those violent fits of self-reproach,
at once genuine and theatrical, of which Guy had a sort of
horror, and it was well Mr. Edmonstone broke in, like comedy
into tragedy.

<p/>' Come, what's past can't be helped, and I have no end of
work to be done, so there's speechifying enough for once. Mr.
Dixon, you must not be going. Sit down and look over the
newspaper, while we sign these papers. You must dine with
us, and drink your nephew's health, though it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) real
birthday.''

<p/>Guy was much pleased that Mr. Edmonstone should have
given this invitation, as well as with the consideration Markham
had shown for Dixon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) narration. Mr. Dixon, who had
learnt to consider parents and guardians as foes and tyrants,
stammered and looked confused and enraptured ; but it appeared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) could not stay, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had a professional engagement.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) gave them an exhortation to come to the concert where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
was employed, and grew so ardent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) description of it, that
Guy could have wished to go ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) companions were in haste
to -say there was far too much to do. And the next moment
Guy told himself, that Mr. Edmonstone's good-natured face and
joyous `eh, Guy?'' were more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) than any music he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
hear nearer than Hollywell.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went down-stairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, who all the way raved
about the music, satisfied to find ears that could comprehend,
and was too full of it even to attend or respond to the parting-
thanks, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) last words were something about a magnificent
counter-tenor.

<p/>Guy walked up slowly, trying to gather his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thoughts : but
when it came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that Amy was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brain
seemed to reel with ecstasy, and it would have taken far more
time than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could spare to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sober senses ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opened
the door, to convince himself at least of Mr. Edmonstone's
presence, and was received with another shake of the hand.

<p/>' So here you are again. I was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was carrying you off
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) concert after all. I believe you have half a mind for it.
Do you like to stay in London for the next ? Eh, Guy ? ' and it
was good to hear Mr. Edmonstone's hearty laugh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) patted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ward on the shoulder, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) blushing, smiling shake of
the head, and gave a knowing look, which let in a fresh light on
Markham, and luckily was unseen by Guy.

<p/>' Well,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Mr. Edmonstone, ' the man is more gentle-
manlike than I expected. A good sort of fellow at the bottom,
I dare say. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was pretty considerably shocked to find he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had
brought you into such a scrape.''



 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>256 THE HEIR OF REDCLYTFE

<p/>* He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is very g:eneroiis/ said Guy. * Oh, there is much of a
noble character in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' Noble ? humph ! ' put in Markham. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has gone down-hill
fast enough, since I used to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) in your father's time ; but
I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had the decency not to be the undoing of you.''

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) feeling is his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) great point,'' said Guy, ' when you can once

<p/>get at it. I wish ' But breaking off short, ``I can't make

<p/>it out. <div class="bookquote">``What did little Marianne tell you? Or was it Miss
Wellwoodr

<p/>* It was first the youngest sister/ said Markham. ' I sat there
talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) some little time ; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said you had been very kind
to the family, and the child was very grateful to you -- was
always talking of some morning when you and your dog came,
and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father had been out all night, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother was crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, and declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be sent
to prison, till you came and helped them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, that's it,'' said Guy.

<p/>' Well, I remembered what you had told me of the mystery
of the draft, and guessed that this might be the clue to it. I
begged to see the child, and in she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) came, the very image of your
mother, and a sharp little thing that knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) meant, but
had not much idea of the shame, poor child, about her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) father.
She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) told me the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coming home in the morning, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) mother being in great distress, and saying they were ruined,
till you came and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) mother, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) something.
I asked if it was money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said it was paper. I showed
her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) a draft, and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) knew it was like that. So then I made her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)
tell me where to find her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) father, whom I used to know in old
times, and had to write to, now and then. I hunted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up,
and a creditable figure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was, to be sure ; but I got the truth
out of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at last, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard you had got into disgrace
on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) account, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raved like a tragedy hero, and swore he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
come and tell your guardian the whole story. I put him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) into a
cab for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should repent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had just got to the end of
it when you came in.''

<p/>' It is of no use to thank you again, Markham \ '

<p/>* Why, I have been getting your family out of scrapes these
forty years or thereabouts,<div class="bookquote">'' said Markham ; ' `tis all I am good
for ; and if they had been no worse than this one, it would be better
for all of us. But time is getting on, and there is enough to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>To the accounts they went at once. There was a good deal
to be settled ; and though Guy had as yet no legal power, accord-
ing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandfather's will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was of course consulted about
everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was glad that, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not be alone to
bring himself to the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) newly-recovered happiness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should have this sobering and engrossing occupation. There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat, coolly discussing leases and repairs, and only now and
then allowing himself a sort of glimpse at the treasury of joy
awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had time to dwell on it. The Coombe
Prior matters were set in a better train, the preliminary arrange-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 257

<p/>ments about the curacy were made, and Guy had hopes it would
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) friend Mr. Wellwood's title for Orders.

<p/>There was no time to write to Hollywell, or rather Mr. Ed-
monstone forgot to do so till it was too late, and then consoled
himself by observing that it did not signify if his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) family were
taken by surprise, since joy killed no one.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) family were by no means of opinion that it did not signify
when the next morning's post brought them no letter. Mrs.
Edmonstone and Charles had hoped much, and Amy did not
know how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had hoped till the melancholy words, ' no
letter,'' passed from one to the other.

<p/>To make it worse, by some of those mismanagements of Mr.
Edmonstone's which used to run counter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife's arrange-
ments, a dinner-party had been fixed for this identical Wednes-
day, and the prospect was agreeable to no one, especially when
the four o'clock train did not bring Mr. Edmonstone, who, there-
fore, was not to be expected till seven, when all the world would
be arrived.

<p/>Laura helped Amy to dress, put the flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hair, kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) it was a trying day ; and Amy sighed wearily,
thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and went down with arms twined in hers, whisper-
ing, ' If I could help being so foolish as to let myself have a
little hope ! '

<p/>Laura thought the case so hopeless, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was sorry Amy
could not cease from the foolishness, and did not answer. Amy
sat down at the foot of the sofa, whither Charles was now carried
down every day, and without venturing to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), worked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) netting. A carriage -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) colour came and went, but it
was only some of the guests ; another -- the Brownlows. Amy
was speaking to Miss Brownlow when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard more greetings ;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up, caught by the arm of the sofa, and looked again.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father was pouring out apologies and welcomes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
mother was shaking hands with Guy.

<p/>Was it a dream 1 She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, then looked again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) by this time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fingers close on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
white glove for one moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice in the
earnest ' How are you, Charlie ? ' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) first his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) usual kiss of greeting, then, not letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) go, looked
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for a moment, and, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not help it, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
on both cheeks, and said, ' How d'ye do, my little Amy V in a
voice that meant unutterable things. All the room was swim-
ming round ; there was nothing for it but to run away, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran, but from the ante-room she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard the call outside,
' Sir Guy's bag to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) room,'' *and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not rush out among
the servants. At that moment, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spied Mary Ross
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) darted up to them, said something incohe-
rent about Mary's bonnet, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own room.

<p/>' Amy, my dear, you look wild. What has come to you ? '

<p/>' Papa is come home, and ' the rest failed, and Amy was as

<p/>red as the camellia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair.



<p/>258 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* And ? ' repeated Mary ; ' and the mystery is explained 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh ! I don't know ; they are only just come, and I was so
silly, I ran away, -- I did not know what to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div><p/>' I`hey are come, are they ? ' thought Mary. ' My little Amy, I
see it all.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) made the taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bonnet and the settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lace
as elaborate an operation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could, and Amy flitted about as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not by any means know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was doing. A springy,
running step was heard on the stairs and in the passage, and
Mary, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little friend's face, perceived
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neck turn red for a moment, after which Amy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm,
pressed it affectionately, and they went down.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was very glad to see Amabel looking
tolerably natural. ' Mamma ' was of course burning to hear'>ll,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was so confident that the essentials were safe, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
present care was to see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) two young lovers would be able
to comport themselves, and to be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) guard against attending
to them more than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) guests.

<p/>Amy, after passing by Charles, and getting a squeeze from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
ever-sympathizing hand, put herself away behind Mary, while
Laura talked to every one, hoping to show that there was some
self-possession in the family. Guy reappeared, but, after one
glance to see if Amy was present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not look at lier again,
but went and leant over the lower end of Charles's sofa, just as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) used to do ; and Charles lay gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and entirely
forgetting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been trying to say just before to Mrs.
Brownlow, professing to have come from London that morning,
and making the absent mistakes likely to be attributed to the
lovers themselves.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstome came, and dinner followed. As Mrs. Edmon-
stone paired off her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) company, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) considered what to do with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) new arrival.

<p/>' If you had come two hours ago,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>), within herself, ' I
would have let you be at home. Now you must be a great man,
and be content with me. It will be better for Amy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly Guy was between her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and Mrs. Gresham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did
not try to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and was amused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fitful attempts
at making conversation with Mrs. Gresham, when it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ought to be taking notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gresham</b></font>). Amy -LRB-very fortunately,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own opinion-RRB- was out of sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), on the same side of
the table, next to Mr. Ross, who, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) daughter, guessed
enough about the state of things to let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) alone.

<p/>Charles was enjoying all manner of deliglitful conjectures with
Charlotte, till the ladies returned to the drawing-room, and tlien
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dared to Mary Ross, far more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had
gained from Laura, who, as they came out of the dining-room,
had said, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me any questions, for I know nothing at all
about it.''

<p/>new flowers, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was by this time able to attend very
well, satisfied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) happiness had returned, and content to
wait till the good time for knowing how. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could even be
composed when the gentlemen came in, Guy talking to Mr. Eoss
about Coombe Prior, and then going to Charles ; but presently
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw no more, for a request for music was made, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
obliged to go and play a duet with Laura. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not dislike
this, but there followed a persecution for some singing. Laura
would have spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), but could not ; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was turn-
ing over the book to try to find something that was not impossible
to begin, and Laura whispering encouragingly, ' This -- try this --
your part is almost nothing ; or can't you do this ? ' another
hand turned over the leaves, as if perfectly at home in them, and,
without speaking, as if it was natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to spare Amy, found
a song which they had often sung together, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might join
as much or as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) chose, under cover of his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
had not a thought or sensation beyond the joy of hearing it again,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood motionless, as if in a trance. When it was over,
he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said to Laura, ' I beg your pardon for making such bad work.
I am so much out of practice.''

<p/>Mrs. Brownlow was seen advancing on them ; Amy retreated,
leaving Guy and Laura to fulfil all that was required of them,
Avhicli they did with a very good grace, and Laura's old familiar
feeling began to revive, so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) whispered while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
finding the place, ' Don't you dislike all this excessively ? '

<p/>' It does as well as anything else, thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' was the answer.
' I can do it better than talking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At last they were released, and the world was going away.
Mary could not help whispering to Mrs. Edmonstone, <div class="bookquote">``How glad
you must be to get rid of us ! ' and, as Mrs. Edmonstone answered
with a smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ventured further to say, -- ' How beautifully
Amy has behaved ! '

<p/>Little Amy, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had heard the last carriage roll off,
wished every one good night, shook hands with Guy, holding
up the lighted candle between him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face as a veil, and
ran away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own room. The others remained in a sort
of embarrassed silence, Mr. Edmonstone rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hands ;
Laura lighted the candles, Charlotte asked after Bustle, and was
answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) was at Oxford, and Charles, laying hold of
the side of the sofa, pulled himself by it into a sitting posture.

<p/>' Shall I help you 1 ' said Guy.

<p/>' Thank you, but I am not ready yet ; besides, I am an actual
log now, and am carried as such, so it is of no use to wait for me.
Mamma shall have the first turn, and I won't even leave my
door open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, yes, yes ; go and have it out with mamma, next best
to Amy herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is run away -- eh, Guy?'' said Mr.
Edmonstone.

<p/>Guy and Mrs. Edmonstone had not hitherto trusted themselves
to speak to each other, but they looked and smiled ; then, wishing

<p/>the rest good night, they disappeared. Then there was a simul-
taneous outbreak of ' Well ? '

<p/>' All right ! ' said Mr. Edmonstone. ' Every word was untrue.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is the noblest fellow in the world, as I knew all the time, and
I was an old fool for listening to a pack of stories against him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).''

<p/>' Hurrah ! ' cried Charles, drumming on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sofa.
' Let us hear how the truth came out, and what it was.''

<p/>' It was that Dixon. There has he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) been helping that man for
ever, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) child to school, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) sums upon sums,
paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) gaming debts with that cheque ! '

<p/>' Oh, oh ! ' cried Charles.

<p/>' Yes that was it ! The child told Markham of it, and Markham
brought the fatlier to tell me. It puts me in a rage to think of
tlie monstrous stories Philip has made me believe ! '

<p/>' I was sure of it ! ' cried Charles. ' I knew it would come out
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had only been so much better than other people that
nobody could believe it. Cleared ! cleared ! Why, Charlotte,
Mr. Eeady-to-halt will be for footing it cleverly enough ! ' as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
was wildly curvetting round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/>' I was always sure,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone. ' I knew it was
not in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to go wrong. It was only Philip, who would persuade
me black was white.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>^I never believed one word of it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; `still less after
I saw Philip's animosity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>^ Les absens out tovjours tort,^ interrupted Laura ; then, afraid
of saying too much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) added, -- ' Come, Charlotte, it is very late.''

<p/>' And I shall be the first to tell Amy ! ' cried Charlotte. ' Good
night, papa ! -- good night, Charlie ! '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) rushed up-stairs, afraid of being forestalled. Laura lin-
gered, putting some books away in the ante-room, trying to
overcome the weary pain at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not know how
to be confident. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) fatlier's judgment was worthless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
eyes, and Philip had predicted that Amy would be sacrificed after
all. To see them happy made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sigh at the distance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own
hopes, and worse than all was self-reproach for unkindness in not
rejoicing with the rest, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) real affection for Guy him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guilty ;
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thouglit of Philip's belief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
innocent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister for enjoying a delusive happi-
ness. With effort, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room, and, finding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a little overpowered by Charlotte's tumultuous joy, saw that
peace and solitude were best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could have more
certain intelligence, and, after very tender good-nights, carried
off'' Charlotte.

<p/>It would be hard to describe Mrs. Edmonstone's emotion, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) preceded Guy to the dressing-room, and sat down, looking
up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) old place by the fire. Slie tliouglit
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not look well, though it might be only that the sun-burnt
colour had given place to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) natural fairness ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes, though
bright as ever, did not dance and sparkle ; a graver expression



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 261

<p/>sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brow ; and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) still looked very young, a change
there certainly was, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) man instead of boy -- a look
of having suffered, and conquered suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt even more
motherly affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) now than when lie last stood there in
the full tide of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first outburst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) daughter, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heart was almost too full for speech ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed to be
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, -- ' I am very glad to have
you here again.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) smiled a little, then said, ' May I tell you all about it ? '

<p/>' Sit down here. I want very much to hear it. I am sure
you have gone through a good deal.''

<p/>' I have, indeed,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), simply and gravely ; and there was
a silence, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was certain that, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have
endured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not feel it to have been in vain.

<p/>' But it is at an end,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). ' I have scarcely seen Mr.
Edmonstone, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is perfectly satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is so kind as to be satisfied, though you know I still can-
not ex23lain about the large sum I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) for.''

<p/>' We will trust you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling ; ' but I am
very anxious to hear how you came to an understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy went over the story in detail, and very much affected she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
was to hear how entirely unfounded had been the suspicion, and
how thankful he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was for Mr. Edmonstone's forgiveness.

<p/>' You had rather to forgive us ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget how ill I behaved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, colouring. ' K you
knew the madness of those first moments of provocation, you
would think that the penance of a lifetime, instead of only one
winter, would scarce have been sufficient.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not say, as Charles does, that the suspicion
justified your anger 1 '

<p/>' No, indeed ! ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) paused and spoke again. ' Thank Heaven,
it did not last long ; but the insight it gave me into the unsub-
dued e\d.l about me was a fearful thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' But you conquered it. They were the unguarded exclama-
tions of the first shock. Your wliole conduct since, especially
the interview with Philip, has shown that your anger has not
been abiding, and that you have learnt to subdue it.''

<p/>' It could not abide, for there was no just cause of offence. Of
course such a dreadful outburst warned me to be on my guard ;
and you know the very sight of Philip is a warning that there is
danger in that way ! I mean,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, becoming conscious that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been very severe, ' I mean that I know of old that I am
apt to be worried by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) manner, and that ought to make me
doubly cautious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was struck by the soberer manner in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) faults. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was as ready to take full blame, but
without the vehemence which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to expend in raving at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self instead of at the offender. It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) had brought
himself to the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) used to desire so earnestly.

<p/>' I am very glad to be able to explain all to Philip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said



<p/>26S THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I will write as soon as possible. Oh, Mrs. Edmonstone ! if you
knew what it is to be brought back to such unhoped-for happiness,
to sit here once more, with you,<div class="bookquote">'' -- liis voice trembled, and the
tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes, -- ' to have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), to liave all overlooked,
and return to all I hoped last year. I want to look at you all, to
believe that it is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) finished, smiling.

<p/>' You both behaved very well this evening,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), laughing,
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could do so better than anything else at that moment.

<p/>' You both ! ' murmured Guy to himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! little Amy has been very good this winter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) with a beautiful expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes, wag
silent a little while, and suddenly exclaimed, in a candid, expostu-
lating tone, ' But now, seriously, don't you think it a very bad
thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) V

<p/>' My dear Guy,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), scarcely repressing a disposition to
laugh, ' I told you last summer what I thought of it, and you
must settle the rest with Amy to-morrow, I hear the drawing-
room bell, which is a sign I must send you to bed. Good night ! '

<p/>' Good night ! ' repeated Guy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lield her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand. ' It is so
long since I have had any one to wish me good night ! Good
night, mamma ! '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ran down to lend a helping
hand in carrying Cliarles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, crossed the
passage to see how it was ^vdth her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little Amy, and to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at
rest for the night.

<p/>Amy's candle was out, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was in bed, lying full in the
light of the Easter moon, which poured in glorious wliiteness
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) started up as the door opened. ' Oh,
mamma ! how kind of you to come ! '

<p/>' I can only stay a moment, my dear ; your papa is coming up ;
but I must just tell you that I have been having such a nice talk
with dear Guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has behaved beautifull-RCB-^, and papa is quite
satisfied. Now, darling, I hope you will not lie awake all night,
or you won't be fit to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to-morrow.''

<p/>Amy sat up in bed, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's neck.
<div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is happy again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to
hear all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) shall tell you himself to-morrow, my dear. Now, good
night ! you have been a very good cliild. Now, go to sleep, my
dear one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Amy lay down obediently. ' Thank you for coming to tell me,
dear mamma,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. ' I am very glad ; good niglit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and there was something in the sweet,
obedient, placid look of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face, as the white moonlight shone
upon it, that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother pause and gaze again with the
feeling, only tenderer, left by a beautiful poem. Amy looked up
to see why she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) delayed ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) another kiss, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
in the moonlight.

<p/>Little Amy's instinct was to believe the best, and do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
bidden, and there was a quietness and confidence in the tone of



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 263

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind which gave a sort of serenity of its own even to sus-
pense. A thankful, happy sensation that all was well, mamma
said so ; and Guy was there, had taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not agitate herself to know how or why, for mamma had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to put herself to sleep ; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought of all the most
thanksgiving verses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) store of poetry, and before the moon
had passed away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) window, Amabel Edmonstone was
wrapped in a sleep dreamless and tranquil as an infant's.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>Hence, bashful cunning,
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.
I am your wife if you will marry me. -- Tempest

<p/>Amabel awoke to such a sense of relief and repose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
scarcely liked to ask herself the cause, lest it might ruffle her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
complete peace. Those words ' all right,'' seemed to be enough
to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) that the cloud was gone.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother came in, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) one or two of the main facts,
and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) down under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wing, only stopping by the way
for a greeting to Charles, who could not rise till after breakfast.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) fast, and gazed up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) face, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) coloured so
deeply, cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eyes, and looked so meek and submissive,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) go, and said nothing.

<p/>The breakfast party were for the most part quiet, silent, and
happy. Even Charlotte was hushed by the subdued feeling of
the rest, and Mr. Edmonstone's hilarity, though replied to in
turn by each, failed to wake them into mirth. Guy ran up and
down-stairs continually, to wait upon Charles ; and thus the
conversation was always interrupted as fast as it began, so that
the only fact that came out was the cause of the lateness of their
arrival yesterday. Mr. Edmonstone had taken it for granted
that Guy, like Philip, would watch for the right time, and warn
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; while Guy, being excessively impatient, had been so much
afraid of letting himself fidget, as to have suffered the right
moment to pass, and then borne all the blame.

<p/>' How you must have wanted to play the Harmonious Black-
smith,'' said Charlotte.

<p/>' I caught myself going through the motions twice,'' said Guy.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone said to herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might contest the
palm of temper with Amy even ; the difference being, that hers
was naturally sweet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a hasty one, so governed that the result
was the same.

<p/>When breakfast was over, as they were rising, Guy made two
steps towards Amabel, at whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had hitherto scarcely looked,
and said, very low, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) straightforward way : ' Can I speak to
you a little while 1 '

<p/>Amy's face glowed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother
said something about the drawing-room, where the next moment



<p/>264 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not use any little restless arts to play
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) embarrassment ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not torment the flowers or the
chimney ornaments, nor even her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own rings ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hands folded and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head a little bent down, like a pendant
blossom, ready to listen to whatever miglit be said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not speak at first, but moved uneasily about. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came nearer, and began speaking fast and nervously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amabel, I want you to consider -- you really ouglit to think
whether this is not a very bad thing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The drooping head was raised, the downcast lids lifted up,
and the blue eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with a look at once confiding
and wondering. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) proceeded --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought you nothing but unhappiness already. So
far as you have taken any interest in me, it could cause you only
pain, and the more I think of it, the more unfit it seems that one
so formed for light, and joy, and innocent mirth, should haA^e
anything to do with the darkness that is round me. Tliink
well of it. I feel as if I had done a selfish thing by you, and
now, you know, you are not bound. You are quite free ! No
one knows anything about it • or if they did, the blame would
rest entirely with me. I would take care it should. So, Amy,
think, and think well, before you risk your happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>rejDlied Amy, in a soft, low voice, with such a look
of truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) clear eyes, ' I must care for whatever happens to
you, and I had rather it was with you, than without you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
said, casting them down again,

<p/>' My Amy ! -- my own ! -- my Verena ! ' -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held fast one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands, as they sat together on the sofa -- ' I had a feeling,
that so it might be through the very worst, yet I can hardly
believe it now.''

<p/>' Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, looking up, with the gentle resolution that
had lately grown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), ' you must not take me for more than
I am worth, and I should like to tell you fairly. I did not speak
last time, because it was all so strange and so deliglitful, and I
had no time to think, because I was so confused. But that is a
long time ago, and this has been a very sad Avinter, and I have
thought a great deal. I know, and you know, too, that I am a
foolish little thing ; I have been silly little Amy always ; you
and Charlie have helped me to all the sense I have, and I don't
think I could ever be a clever, strong-minded woman, such as
one admires.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid !''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Guy; moved, perhaps, by a cer-
tain remembrance of St. Mildred's.

<p/>' But,'' continued Amy, ' I believe I do really wish to be good,
and I know you have helped me to wish it much more, and I
have been trying to learn to bear things, and so' -- out came
something, very like a sunny smile, though some tears followed --
`so if you do like such a silly little thing, it can't be lielped, and
we will try to make the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Only don't say any more
about my being happier without you ; for one thing I am very



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 265

<p/>sure of, Guy, I had rather bear anything with you, than know
you were bearing it alone. I am only afraid of being foolish and
weak, and making things worse for you.''

<p/>' So much worse ! But still,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, ' speak as you may, my
Amy, I cannot, must not, feel that I have a right to think of
you as my own, till you have heard all. You ought to know
v/hat my temper is before you risk yourself in its power. Amy,
my first thought towards Philip was nothing short of murder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, and saw how far entirely he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said.

<p/>' The first -- not the second,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the second -- the third. There was a moment when I
could have given my soul for my revenge ! '

<p/>' Only a moment ! '

<p/>' Only a moment, thank Heaven ! and I have not done quite
so badly since. I hope I have not suffered quite in vain ; but if
that shock could overthrow all my wonted guards, it might,
though I pray Heaven it may not, it might happen again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you conquered yourself then, and that you will
again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/>' And suppose I was ever to be mad enough to be angry with
you?''

<p/>Amy smiled outright here. * Of course, I should deserve it ;
but I think the trouble would be the comforting you afterwards.
Ivlamma said' -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) added, after a long silence, during whicli
Guy's feeling would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) speak -- `mnmma said, and I
think, that you are much safer and better with such a quick
temper as yours, because you are always struggling and fighting
witli it, on the real true religious ground, than a person more even
tempered by nature, but not so much in earnest in doing right.''

<p/>' Yes, if I did not believe myself to be in earnest about that, I
could never dare to sj3eak to you at all.''

<p/>' We will help each other,'' said Amy ; ' you have always helped
me, long before we knew we cared for each other ! '

<p/>' And, Amy, if you knew how the thought of you helped me
last winter, even when I thought I had forfeited you for ever.''

<p/>Their talk only ceased when, at one o'clock, Mrs. Edmonstone,
who had pronounced in the dressing-room that three hours was
enough for them at once, came in, and asked Guy to go and help
to carry Charles down-stairs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went, and Amy nestled up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face
to be kissed.

<p/>' It is very nice ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) whispered ; and then arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
brother's sofa, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) progress down-stairs beginning.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so light and thin as to be very easily carried, and was
brought in between Guy and one of the servants. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
settled on the sofa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began thus, -- ' There was a grand oppor-
tunity lost last winter. I was continually rehearsing the scene,
and thinking what waste it was to go through such a variety of
torture without the dignity of danger. If I could but have got



<p/>266 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>up ever so small an alarm, I would have conjured my father to
send for Guy, entreated pathetically that the reconciliation
might be effected, and have drawn my last breath clasping their
hands, thus ! Tlie curtain falls ! '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made a feint of joining their hands, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head back, and
shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes witli an air and a grace that put Charlotte into an
ecstasy, and made even Amy laugh, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) quitted the room,
blushing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if it had been your last breath,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, `you
would not have been much the wiser.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would have come to life again in time to enjoy the coup de
theatre. I had some thoughts of trying an overdose of opium ; but
I thought Dr. May erne would have found me out. I tell you,
because it is fair I should have the credit ; for, Guy, if you knew
what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was to me all the winter, you would perceive my super-
human generosity in not receiving you as my greatest enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I shall soon cease to be surprised at any superhuman gener-
osity,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' But how thin you are, Charlie ; you are a very
feather to carry ; I had no notion it had been such a severe
business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Most uncommon ! ' said Charles, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head, with a
mock solemnity.

<p/>' It was the worst of all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, ' six weeks
of constant pain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' How very sorry Philip must have been ! ' exclaimed Guy.
' Philip 1 ' said Charlotte.

<p/>' Why, was it not owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) 1 Surely, your father told me
so. Did not he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) let you fall on the stairs 1 '

<p/>' My dear father ! ' exclaimed Charles, laughing ; ' every dis-
aster that happens for the next twelvemonth will be imputed
to Philip.''

<p/>' How was it, then ? ' said Guy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact was this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; `it was in the thick. of the
persecution of you, and I was obliged to let Philip drag me up-
stairs, because I was in a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took the opportunity of
giving me some impertinent advice which I could not stand. I
let go his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arm, forgetting what a dependent mortal I am, and
down I should assuredly have gone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not caught me, and
carried me off, as a fox does a goose. So it was liis fault, as one
may say, in a moral, though not in a physical sense.''

<p/>' Then,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) mother, ' you do think your illness was owing
to that accident ? '

<p/>``I suppose the damage was brewing, and that the shake brought
it into an active state. Tliere's a medical opinion for you ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I never knew what you thought of it before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Edmonstone.

<p/>' Wliy, when I had a condor to pick on Guy's account witli

<p/>Philip, I was not going to pick a crow on my own,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Oh ! is luncheon ready ; and you all going ? I never see

<p/>anybody now. I want the story of the shipwreck, though, of



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 267

<p/>course, Ben What's-his-name was the hero, and Sir Guy Morville
not a bit of it.''

<p/>Laura wanted to walk to East Hill, and the other young
people agreed to go thither, too.

<p/>' It will be nice to go to church there to-day,'' said Amy, in a
half wliisper, heard only by Guy, and answered by a look that
showed how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) understood and symjoathized.

<p/>' Another thing,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, colouring a good deal ; ' shall you
mind my telling Mary ? I behaved so oddly last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
was so kind to me that I think I ought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had seen enough last night to be very curious to-day,
though hardly expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) curiosity to be gratified. However,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bonnet for church, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window, and saw the four coming across the fields from
HoUywell. Guy and Amy did not walk into the village arm-in-
arm ; but, as they came under the church porch, Guy, unseen by
all, lield out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand, sought hers, and, for one moment, pressed
it fervently. Amy knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) felt this like their betrotlial.

<p/>After the service, they stood talking with Mr. Ross and Mary,
for some little time. Amy held apart, and Mary saw how it
was. As they were about to turn homewards, Amy said quickly,
' Come and walk a little way home with me.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went on with Mary before the rest ; and when out of sight
of them all, said, ' Mary ! ' and then stopped short.

<p/>' I guess something. Amy,'' said Mary.

<p/>' Don't tell any one but Mr. Ross.''

<p/>' Then I have guessed right. My dear little Amy, I am very
glad ! So tnat was the reason you flew out of the room last
evening, and looked so bright and glowing ! '

<p/>' It was so good of you to ask no questions ! '

<p/>' I don't think I need ask any now. Amy ; for I see in your
face how right and happy it all is.''

<p/>' I can't tell you all, Mary, but I must one thing, -- that the
whole terrible story arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) helping a person in distress.
I like you to know that.''

<p/>' Papa was always sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had not been to blame,'' said
Mary.

<p/>' Yes ; so Charlie told me, and that is the reason I wanted you
to know.''

<p/>' Then, Amy, something of this had begun last summer ? '

<p/>' Yes ; but not as it is now. I did not half know what it was
then.''

<p/>' Poor dear little Amy,'' said Mary ; ' what a very sad winter
it must have been for you ! '

<p/>' Oh, very ! ' said Amy ; ' but it was worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was quite alone ; and here every one was so kind to me.
Mamma and Laura, and poor Charlie, through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) illness and
pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was so very kind. And do you know, Mary, now it is
all over, I am very glad of this dismal time ; for I think that it
has taught me how to bear things better.''



<p/>268 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked very happy. Yet it struck Mary that it was strange to
hear that the first thought of a newly-betrothed maiden was how
to brace herself in endurance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered, however, whether
it was not a more truly happy and safe frame tlian that of most
girls, looking forward to a life of unclouded happiness, such as
could never be realized. At least, so it struck Mary, though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) owned to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) experience of lovers was limited.

<p/>Mary walked with Amy almost to the borders of Hollywell
garden ; and when the rest came up with them, thougli no word
passed, there was a great deal of congratulation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) warm
shake of Guy's hand, and no lack of reply in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) proud smile and
reddening cheek. Charlotte could not help turning and going
back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) a little way, to say, ' Are not you deliglited, Mary 1
Is not Amy the dearest thing in the world ? And you don't
know, for it is a secret, and I know it, how very noble Guy has
been, while they would suspect liim.''

<p/>' I am very, very glad, indeed ! It is everything delightful'

<p/>' I never was so happy in my life,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte ; ' nor Charlie,
either. Only think of having Guy for our brother ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is
going to send for Bustle to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary laughed, and parted with Charlotte, speculating on the
cause of Laura's graver looks. Were they caused by the fear of
losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister, or by a want of confidence in Guy ?

<p/>That evening, how happy was tlie party at Hollywell, when
Charles put Guy through a cross-examination on the shipwreck,
from the first puff* of wind to the last drop of rain ; and Guy
submitted very patiently, since lie was allowed the solace of
praising his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Redclyffe fishermen.

<p/>Indeed, this time was full of tranquil, serene happiness. It
was like the lovely weather only to be met with in the spring,
and then but rarely, when the sky is cloudless, and intensely
blue, -- the sunshine one glow of clearness without burning, -- not
a breath of wind checks the silent growth of the expanding buds
of light exquisite green. Such days as these shone on Guy and
Amabel, looking little to the future, or if they did so at all, with
a grave, peaceful awe, reposing in the present, and resuming old
habits, -- singing, reading, gardening, walking as of old, and that
intercourse with each other that was so much more than ever
before.

<p/>It was more, but it was not quite the same ; for Guy was a
very chivalrous lover ; the polish and courtesy that sat so well
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) frank, truthful manners, were even more remarkable in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) courtship. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ways with Amy had less of easy familiarity
than in the time of their brother-and-sister-like intimacy, so that
a stranger miglit have imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wooed, not won. It was as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hardly dared to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could really be his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own,
and treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with a sort of reverential love and gentleness,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with ever-increasing honour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
was better able to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) now than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more childish
days last summer ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not merely see, as before, that



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 269

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was looking at the upper surface of a mystery. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had,
at the same time, grown in character ; his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) excitability and
over-sensitiveness seemed to have been smoothed away, and to
have given place to a calmness of tone, that was by no means
impassibility.

<p/>When alone with Amy, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was generally very grave, often
silent and meditative, or else their talk was deep and serious ;
and even with the family he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was less merry and more thought-
ful than of old, though very bright and animated, and showing
full, free affection to them all, as entirely accepted and owned
as one of them.

<p/>So, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was. Mr. Edmonstone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) intense delight
in lovers, patronized them, and made commonplace jokes, which
they soon learnt to bear without much discomposure. Mrs.
Edmonstone was all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) constant appellation of ' mamma '
betokened, delighting in Guy's having learnt to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) so,
Charles enjoyed the restoration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend, the sight of Amy's
happiness, and the victory over Philip, and was growing better
every day. Charlotte was supremely happy, watching the first
love affair ever conducted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sight, and little less so in the
return of Bustle, who resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old habits as regularly as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had only left HoUywell yesterday.

<p/>Laura alone was unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own
feelings ; but sad at heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was, with only one who could
sympathize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) far away, and the current of feeling
setting against him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) depression, and
was obliged to allow it to be attributed to the grief that one
sister must feel in parting with another ; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) compassion
for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) little Amy, coupled with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) latent jealousy,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) particularly tender and affectionate, it gave even more
probability to the supposition. This made Guy, who felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was committing a robbery on them all, particularly kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wished to atone for the injury of taking away her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sister ;
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) kindness gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) additional pain at entertaining such
hard thoughts of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).

<p/>How false she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was pitied ! and how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hated
the congratulations, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had the full share ! She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
thought, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should be able to rejoice when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
had heard Philip's opinion ; and how delightful it would be for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to declare himself satisfied with Guy's exculpation.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVII

<p/>I forgave thee all the blajiie,

<p/>I could not forgive the praise. -- Tennyson

<p/>* If ever there was a meddlesome coxcomb on this earth ! '
Such was the exclamation that greeted the ears of Guy as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) supported Charles into the breakfast-room ; and, at the same
time, Mr. Edmonstone tossed a letter into Guy's plate, saying, --



<p/>270 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* There's something for you to read.''

<p/>Guy began ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips were tightly pressed together ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brows
made one black line across his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eye sparkled
even through his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bent-down eyelashes ; but this lasted only a
few moments ; the forehead smoothed again, and there was a
kind of deliberate restraint and force upon himself, which had so
much power, that no one spoke till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had finished, folded it up
with a sort of extra care, and returned it, only saying, --

<p/>' You should not show one such letters, Mr. Edmonstone.''

<p/>' Does not it beat everything 1 ' cried Mr. Edmonstone. ' If that
is not impertinence, I should like to know what is ! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has
played my Lord Paramount rather too long, as I can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ! I
ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) consent, forsooth ! Probation, indeed ! You might marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to-morrow, and welcome. There, give it to mamma. See
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) does not say the same. Mere spite and malice all along.''

<p/>Poor Laura ! would no one refute such cruel injustice 1 Yes,
Guy spoke, eagerly, --

<p/>' No no ; that it never was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite right under his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) belief.''

<p/>' Don't tell me ! Not a word in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) favour will I hear ! '
stormed on Mr. Edmonstone. ' Mere envy and ill-will,''

<p/>' I always told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) so,'' said Charles. ' Pure malignity ! '

<p/>' Nonsense, Charlie ! ' said Guy, sharply ; ' there is no such
thing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Guy, I can't stand this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr, Edmonstone. ``I
won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) defended ; I never thought to be so deceived ; but
you all worshipped the boy as if every word that came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
mouth was Gospel truth, and you've set him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would
not condescend to take an advice of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own father, who little
thought what an upstart sprig he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was rearing ; but I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has come to the wrong shop for domineering -- eh, mamma 1 '

<p/>' Well ! ' cried Mrs. Edmonstone, who had read till near the
end with tolerable equanimity ; ' this really is too bad ! '

<p/>' Mamma and all ! ' thought poor Laura, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother con-
tinued, -- <div class="bookquote">``It is wilful prejudice, to say the least, -- I never could
have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) capable of it ! '

<p/>Charles next had the letter, and was commenting on it in a
style of mingled sarcasm and fury ; while Laura longed to see
it justify itself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was sure it would.

<p/>' Kead it, all of you -- every bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Edmonstone, ' that
you may see this paragon of yours ! '

<p/>' I had rather not,'' said Amy, shrinking as it came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>' I should like you to do so, if you don't dislike it very much,''
said Guy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) read in silence ; and then came the turn of Laura, who
marvelled at the general injustice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) read.

<p/>' Cork, April 8th.

<p/>' My dear Uncle, -- I am much obliged to you for the com-
munication of your intention with regard to Amabel ; but, in-
deed, I must say I am a good deal surprised that you should have



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 271

<p/>so hastily resolved on so important a step, and have been satisfied
with so incomplete an explanation of circumstances which ap-
peared to you, as well as to myself, to show that Guy's character
was yet quite unsettled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conduct such as to create
considerable apprehension tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was habitually extremely
imprudent, to say the least of it, in the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own
affairs. How much more, unfit, therefore, to have the happiness
of another intrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? I believe -- indeed, I understood
you to have declared to me that you were resolved never to
allow the engagement to be renewed, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should, with the
deference which is only due to you as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) guardian, consent to
clear up the mystery with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has thought fit to invest all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pecuniary transactions ; and this, it appears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) refuses, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
persists in denying all explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) demand for that large
sum of money. As to the cheque, which certainly was applied
to discreditable uses, though I will not suffer myself to suppose
that Guy was in collusion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle, yet it is not at all
improbable that Dixon, not being a very scrupulous person,
may, on hearing of the difficulties in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) nephew has been
placed, come forward to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) embarrassment, in
the hope of further profit, by thus establishing a claim on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
gratitude. In fact, this proof of secretly renewed intercourse
with Dixon rather tends to increase the presumption that there is
something wrong. I am not writing this in the expectation that
the connection should be entirely broken off'', for that, indeed,
would be out of the question as things stand at present ; but
for my little cousin's sake, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own, I entreat of you
to pause. They are both extremely young -- so young, that if
there was no other ground, many persons would think it advis-
able to wait a few years ; and why not wait until the time fixed
by his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) grandfather for his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) coming into possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pro-
perty ? If the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) attachment to Amabel is firm
and true, the probation may be of infinite service to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), as
keeping before him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), during the most critical period of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) life,
a powerful motive for restraining the natural impetuosity of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
disposition ; while, on the other hand, if this should prove to
have been a mere passing fancy for the first young lady into
whose society he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has been thrown on terms of easy familiar
intercourse, you will then have the satisfaction of reflecting that
your care and caution have preserved your daughter from a life
of misery. My opinion has never altered respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ; that
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is brave and generous, with good feelings and impulses,
manners peculiarly attractive, and altogether a character calcu-
lated to inspire affection, but impetuous and unsteady, easily led
into temptation, yet obstinate in reserve, and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) temper of
unchecked violence. I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) happiness of every kind ; and,
as you well know, would do my utmost for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) welfare ; but my
aff<div class="bookquote">``ection for your whole family, and my own conscientious con-
viction, make me feel it my duty to offer this remonstrance,
which I hope will be regarded as by no means the result of any

<p/>' Yours afi'ectionately,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``P. MORVILLE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>All the time Laura was reading, Guy was defending Philip
against the exaggerated abuse that Mr. Edmonstone and Charles
were pouring out, till at last, Mrs. Edmonstone, getting out of
patience, said, --

<p/>' My dear Guy, if we did not know you so well, we should
almost accuse you of affectation.''

<p/>' Then I shall go away,'' said Guy, laughing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rose. ' Can
you come out with me ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), in a lower tone, leaning over
the back of Amy's chair.

<p/>' No ; wait a bit,'' interposed Mr. Edmonstone ; ' don't take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) out, or you won't be to be found anywhere, and I want to
speak to you before I write my letter, and go to the Union
Meeting. I want to tell Master Philip, on the spot, that the
day is hxed, and we snap our fingers at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) probation.
Wait till twenty-five ! I dare say ! '

<p/>At <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>the ladies had made the first
move towards departure, but they were not out of hearing at
the conclusion. Guy looked after Amy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not look
round, and Charles lay twisting Bustle's curls round his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fingers,
and smiling to himself at the manner in which the letter was
working by contraries. The overthrow of Philip's influence was
a great triumph for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), apart from the way in which it affected
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone was disappointed that Guy would not set
about fixing the day, in time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to announce it in a letter
to be written in the course of an hour. Guy said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not
begun on the subject with Amy, and it would never do to hurry
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Indeed, it was a new light to himself that Mr. Edmonstone
would like it to take place so soon.

<p/>' Pray, when did you think it was to be ? ' said Mr, Edmonstone.
' Upon my word, I never in all my days saw a lover like you, Guy ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was too happy to think about the future; besides, I did
not know whether you had sufficient confidence in me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Confidence, nonsense ! I tell you if I had a dozen daughters,
I would trust them all to you.''

<p/>Guy smiled, and was infected by Charles's burst of laughing,
but Mr. Edmonstone went on unheeding -- ``I have the most
absolute confidence in you ! I am going to write to Philip this
minute, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has played three-tailed Bashaw rather too
long. I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) it is to be very soon, at any rate ; and that
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wishes to see how I value liis pragmatical advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may
come and dance at the wedding. I declare, your mamma and tliat
colonel of his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) have perfectly spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) with their flattery ! I
knew wliat would come of it ; you all would make a prodigy of
him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is so puffed up, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) entirely forgets who he (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is ! '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 278

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; `that can't be laid to my door/
' But I'll write him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) such a letter this instant as shall make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) who he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) has to deal
with. Eh, Charlie?''

<p/>' Don't you think,'' said Guy, preparing to go, ' that it might
be better to wait a day or two, till we see our way clearer, and
are a little cooler ? '

<p/>' I tell you, Guy, there is no one that puts me out of patience
now, but yourself. You are as bad as Philip himself. Cool ?
I am coolness itself, all but what's proper spirit for a man to
show when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family is affronted, and himself dictated to, by a
meddling young jackanapes. I'll serve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out properly ! '

<p/>A message called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away. Guy stood looking perplexed
and sorrowful.

<p/>' Never mind,'' said Charles, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take care the letter is moderate.
Besides, it is only Philip, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knows that letter- writing is not
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am afraid things will be said in irritation, which you will
both regret. There are justice and reason in the letter.<div class="bookquote">''
' There shall be more in the answer, as you will see.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>' No, I will not see. It is Mr. Edmonstone's concern, not mine.
I am the last person who sliould have anything to do with it.<div class="bookquote">''
' Just what the individual in question would net have said.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>' Would you do one thing to oblige me, Charlie ? '
<div class="bookquote">``Anything but not speaking my mind to, or of, the captain.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>' That is the very thing, unluckily. Try to get the answer put
off till to-morrow, and that will give time to look at this letter
candidly.''

<p/>' All the candour in the world will not make me think other-
wise than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) is disappointed at being no longer able to
make us the puppets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) malevolence. Don't answer, or if you
do, tell me what you say in favour of that delicate insinuation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>).''

<p/>Guy made a step towards the window, and a step back again.
' <div class="bookquote">``Tis not fair to ask such questions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) replied, after a moment.
' It is throwing oil on the lire. I was trying to forget it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
neither knows my uncle nor the circumstances.''

<p/>``Well, I am glad there is a point on which you can't even
pretend to stand up for him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), or I should have thought you crazed
with Quixotism. But I am keeping you when you, want to be
off to Amy. Never mind Mr. Ready-to-halt ; I sHall wait till
my father comes back. If you want the letter put off, you had

<p/>better give some hopes of Oh ! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is gone, and disinterested

remains to be proved. Laura, poor thing, looks like Patience on
a monument. I wonder whether Philip's disgrace has anything
to do with it. Hum ! If mamma's old idea was right, the caj^tain
has been more like moth and candle than consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
prudence, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought it ci toute epreuve. I wonder what
came to pass last autumn, when I was ill, and mamma's head

<p/>T



<p/>274 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>full of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may not intend it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) may not know it, but
I would by no means answer for Cupid's being guiltless of that
harassed look she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) has had ever since that ball -going summer.
Oh ! there go that pretty study, Amy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) true knight. As
to Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is more incomprehensible than ever ; yet there is no
avoiding obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), on the principle on which that child in
the <div class="bookquote">'' Moorland cottage ''  (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>puppets</b></font>) should obey Don Quixote.''

<p/>So when his (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>) father came in, Charles wiled him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) into deferring
the letter till the next day, by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) an indistinct hope that
some notion, when the marriage would be, might be arrived at
by that time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) consented the more readily, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
in haste to investigate a complaint that had just been made of
the union doctor ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last words to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife and gon before
he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went, were -- ' Of course, they must marry directly ; there is
nothing on earth to wait for. Live at Redclyffe alone ? Not to
be thought of. No ; I'll see little Amy my Lady Morville, before
Philip goes abroad, if only to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) I am not a man to be
dictated to.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone sighed ; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) agreed
with Charles that there was nothing to wait for, and that it
would be better for Guy to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife at once with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) settled at RedclyfFe. So it must be whenever Amy could
make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind to it ; and thereupon they made plans for
future meetings, Charles announcing that the Prince of the Black
Isles would become locomotive, and Charlotte forming grand
designs upon Shag Island.

<p/>In the meantime, Guy and Amy were walking in the path
through the wood, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began : ' I would not have asked
you to do anything so unpleasant as reading that letter, but I
thought you ought to consider of it.''

<p/>' It was just like himself ! How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? ' said Amy, indig-
nantly.

<p/>' I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will ever see his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own harshness 1 ' said
Guy. ' It is very strange, that with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) excellence and real
kindness, there should be some distortion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) view of all that
concerns me. I cannot understand it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must let me call it prejudice, Guy, in spite of your
protest. It is a relief to say something against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Amy, don't be venomous ! ' said Guy, in a playful tone of
reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes ; but you know it is not me whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has been abusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well,'' said Guy, musingly, ' I suppose it is right there should
be this cloud, or it would be too bright for earth. It has been
one of my chief wishes to have things straight with Philip, ever
since the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stayed at Redclyffe as a boy. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
superiority then ; but it fretted me, and I never could make
a companion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Ever since, I have looked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) approval
as one of the best things to be won. It shows his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ascendancy
of character ; yet, do what I will, the mist has gone on thicken-
ing between us ; and with reason, for I liave never been able to

<p/>give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the confidence he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) required, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) conduct about my

to be wilful. ' I only hope you don't want to make me do the
same. I could bear anything better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old saying about
your attractive manners and good imj-RRB-ulses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opinion that
has never altered. O Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is the most provoking joerson in
all the world. Don't try to make me admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), nor be sorry
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not when you remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was looked on here? and
how, without doing anything worthy of blame, nay, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)

<p/>' Yes, yes, yes, it is like you ; but don't ask me to feel that yet,<div class="bookquote">''
said Amy, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes, ' or I shall be obliged to tell
you what you won't like to hear, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tone of triumph that
terrible time last year. It was so very different, I don't think

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arm. ' Yes ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought himself right.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meant to do the kindest thing by you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), so entirely
without effort, that no one could doubt it came straight from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
heart. <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thinks still, Amy ; there is fairness, justice, good

my first trial.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! '

be more fixed, and altogether you might have more confidence ? '

<p/>' But what do you think 1 Is there not some reason in what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) says ? '

<p/>' The only use I can see is, that perhaps I should be wiser at

added, blushing, ' but I think it v/ould be dismal for you to go

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Honestly, Amy,'' replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), after a little pause, ' if you feel
so, and your father approves, I don't think it will be better to

<p/>wait. I know your presence is a safeguard, and if the right
motives did not suffice to keep me straight, and I was only appa-
rently so from hopes of you, why then I sliould be so utterly
good for nothing at the bottom, if not on the surface, that you
had better have nothing to say to me.''

<p/>Amy laughed incredulously.

<p/>' That being settled,'' proceeded Guy, * did you hear what your
father said as you left the breakfast-room ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) coloured all over, and there was silence. ' What did you
answer 1 ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), at length.

<p/>' I said, whatever happened, you must not be taken by surprise
in having to decide quickly. Do you wish to have time to
think ? I'll go in and leave you to consider, if you like.''

<p/>' I only want to know what you wish,'' said Amy, not parting
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm.

<p/>' I had rather you did just as suits you best. Of course, you
know what my wish must be.''

<p/>Amy walked on a little way in silence. ' Very well,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
presently, ' I think you and mamma had better settle it. The
worst ' -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes -- ' the going away -- mamma --
Charlie -- all that will be as bad at one time as at another.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The
tears flowed faster. ' It had better be as you all like best.''

<p/>' O Amy ! I wonder at myself for daring to ask you to exchange
your bright cheerful home for my gloomy old house.''

<p/>' No, your home,'' said Amy, softly.

<p/>' I used to wonder why it was called gloomy ; but it will be so
no more when you are there. Yet there is a shadow hanging
over it, which makes it sometimes seem too strange that you and
it should be brought together.''

<p/>I have read somewhere that there is no real gloom but what

<p/>raise for themselves.<div class="bookquote">''
True. Gloom is in sin, not sorrow. Yes, there would be no
comfort if I were not sure that if aught of grief or pain should
come to you through me, it will not, cannot really hurt you, my

Hark ! was that a nightingale ? '

<p/>' Yes, the first ! How beautiful ! There-- don't you see it ?

when they had listened for a long time, -- ' after all, that creature
and the sea will hardly let on 3 speak of gloom, even in this world,

<p/>' The sea ! I am glad I have never seen it, because now you
will show it to me for the first time.''

<p/>' You will never, can never imagine it, Amy ! ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sung, --

<p/>' With all tones of waters blending,

Glorious, beauteous, without ending,
Songs of ocean never sleep.*

<p/>A silence followed, only broken by the notes of the birds, and



<p/>people



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 277

<p/>presently by the strokes of the great clock. Guy looked at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) watch.

<p/>' Eleven, Amy ! I must go to my reading, or you will have to
be very much ashamed of me.''

<p/>For, after the first few days, Guy had returned to study regu-
larly every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said it was a matter of necessity, not at all
of merit, for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not mean to try for honours. Amy
must not marry a plucked man. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole career at Oxford
had been such a struggle with the disadvantages of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) education,
that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) diligence had, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, hardly raised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a level
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contemporaries. Moreover, courtship was not the best
preparation for the schools, so that though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done
liis best, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected no more than to pass respectably, and told
Amy it was very good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to be contented with a dunce,
whereat she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laughed merrily. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too well to try
to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lingering in the April sunshine, and in they went,
Guy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Greek, and Amy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother. Charlotte's lessons
had been in abeyance, or turned over to Laura of late, and Mrs.
Edmonstone and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) dressing-room were always ready for the
confidences of the family, who sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) there in turn -- all but
one, and that the one whose need was the sorest.

<p/>Amy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother comforted themselves with a good quiet
cry, that was not exactly sorrowful, and came to the conclusion
that Guy was the most considerate person in the world, and they
would do whatever best suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and papa. So, when Mr.
Edmonstone came home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was rewarded for putting off'' the
letter by finding every one willing to let the marriage take place
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) pleased. There were various conferences in the
dressing-room, and Guy and Amy both had burning faces when
they came down to dinner. Laura beheld them with a throbbing
heart, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mechanically talked to Dr. May erne, as if nothing
was going on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was glad there was no singing that evening,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) felt incapable of joining ; and when at night Charles and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father talked of sitting up to write to Philip, the misery was
such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had no relief till she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had shut herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) room,
to bear or to crush the suffering as best she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) might.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was still sitting helpless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wretchedness when Amy
knocked at the door, and came in glowing with blushes and
smiles, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyelashes were dewy with tears.

<p/>' Laura, dearest ! if you would not be so very unhappy ! I
wish I knew what to do for you.''

<p/>Laura laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) shoulder, and cried. It was a
great comfort, little as Amy could understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) trouble. Amy
kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) caressingly, cried too, and said, in broken
sentences, how often they would be together, and how comfort-
able it was that Charlie was so much better, and Charlotte quite
a companion.

<p/>' Then you have fixed the day 1 ' whispered Laura, at last.

<p/>' The Tuesday in Whitsun-week,<div class="bookquote">'' returned Amy, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
forehead on Laura's shoulder. ' They all thought it riglit.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>278 THE HEIE OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>Laura flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and wept too much to speak.

<p/>' Dear, dear Laura ! ' said Amy, after a time, ' it is very kind
of you, but '

<p/>' Oh, Amy ! you don't know. You must not think so much

<p/>better of me than I deserve. It is not only No, I would not

<p/>be so selfish, if but-- but-- ' Never had her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) self-command so
given way.

<p/>' Ah ! you are unhappy about Philip,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; and Laura,
alarmed lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might have betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), started, and tried to
recover herself ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw Amy was quite unsuspicious, and
the relief from this fright helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) through what her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister was
saying, -- ' Yes, you, who were so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), must be vexed at
this unkindness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>* I am sure it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) real wish for your good,'' murmured Laura.

<p/>' I dare say ! ' said Amy, with displeasure. Then changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
tone, <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, dear Laura, but I don't think I can
quite bear to hear any one but Guy defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is very generous.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, is not it, Laura? and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is so grieved to see us
turned against Philip, after being so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) says it
makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had supplanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is quite
thankful to you for taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) part still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' How shall I bear it ? ' sighed Laura, to herself.

<p/>' I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will come 1 ' said Amy, thoughtfully.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will,'' said Laura.

<p/>' You think so ? ' said Amy. ' Well, Guy would be glad. Yes.

<p/>Laura, if Philip would learn to do Guy justice, I don't think
there would be any more to wish ! '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will in time,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is too generous not to be
won by such generosity as Guy's ; and when all this is forgotten,
and all these accusations have been lived down, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will be the
warmest of friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wished to be convinced ; `but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would only leave off saying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opinion has never altered, I think

<p/>1 could bring myself to look on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as Guy wants me to do.
Good night ! dear Laura, and don't be unhappy. Oh ! one thing
I must tell you ; Guy made Charles promise to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
not to let it be a hasty letter. Now, good night ! '

<p/>Poor Laura, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew not whether gratitude to Guy was not
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) most painful sensations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wished much to know
what had been said in the letter ; but only one sentence trans-
pired, and that was, that Mr. Edmonstone had never heard it
was necessary to apply to a nephew for consent to a daughter's
marriage. It seemed as if it must have been as cutting as
Charles could make it ; but Laura trusted to Philip's knowledge
of tlie family, and desire for their good, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forgive it ;
and the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) again at the wedding, cheered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Indeed, a hope of still greater consequences began to rise
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mind, after Cliarles one day said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), ``I think you
oucht to be much obliged to Guy. This morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) suddenly



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 279

<p/>exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">'' I say, Charlie, I wish you would take care Amy's
fortune is not settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so that it can't be got rid of.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
asked how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) meant to make ducks and drakes of it ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
explained, that if either of you two did not happen to marry for
money, like Amy, it might do you no harm.''

<p/>' We are very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>),'' said Laura, more earnestly
than Charles had expected. ' Do you know what it is, Charlie 1 '

<p/>' Oh ! you want to calculate the amount of your obligation !
Somewhere about five thousand pounds, I believe.''

<p/>Charles watched Laura, and the former idea recurred, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wondered whether there was any particular meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
inquiry.

<p/>Meaning, indeed, there was. Laura knew nothing about the
value of money ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not know what Philip had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own ;
how far five, or even ten, thousand would go in enabling them
to marry, or whether it was available in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father's lifetime ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought this prospect might smooth the way to the
avowal of their attachment, as efiectually as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) promotion ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
reckoned on relief from the weary oppression of secrecy, and
fully expected that it would all be told in the favourable junc-
ture, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) parents were full of satisfaction in Amy's marriage.
Gratitude to Guy would put an end to all doubt, dislike, and
prejudice, and Philip would receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as a brother.

<p/>These hopes supported Laura, and enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to take part
with more appearance of interest in the consultations and ar-
rangements for the marriage, which were carried on speedily, as
the time was short, and Mr. Edmonstone's ideas were on a grand
scale. It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) meant to invite all the world, and there
were no limits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) views of breakfast, carriages, and splendours.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife let him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) run on without contradiction, lea^dng the plans
either to evaporate or condense, as time might prove best. Guy
took Amy out walking, and asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought of it.

<p/>' Do you dislike it very much 1 ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said.

<p/>' I can hardly tell. Of course, as a general rule, the less parade
and nonsense the better ; but if your father wishes it, and if
people do find enjoyment in that way, it seems hard they should
not have all they can out of it.''

<p/>' Oh, yes ; the school children and poor people,'' said Amy.

<p/>' How happy the Ashford children will be, feasting the poor
people at Redely fFe ! Old Jonas Ledbury will be in high glory.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure it does not seem like merit to feast one's poor
neighbours rather than the rich. It is so much pleasanter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' However, since the poor will be feasted, I don't think the
rich ones will do us much harm.''

<p/>' I am sure I shall know very little about them,'' said Amy.

<p/>' The realities are so great to us, that they will swallow up
the accessories. There must be the church, and all that ; and
for the rest. Amy, I don't think I shall find out whether you
wear lace or grogram.''

<p/>' There's encouragement for me ! ' said Amy, laughing. ' Ho we ve r,



<p/>280 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>what I mean is, that I don't care about it, if I am not obliged
to attend, and give my mind, to those kind of things just then,
and that mamma will take care of.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not a great trouble for her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)? I forgot that. It was
selfish ; for we slip out of the fuss, and it all falls on her (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy • ' but don't you think it would tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more
to have to persuade papa out of what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) likes, and alter every
little matter ? That would be worry, the rest only exertion ; and,
do you know, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), with a rising tear, ' that it will
be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from thinking about losing me.''

<p/>' I see. Very well, we will take the finery quietly. Only one
thing. Amy, we will not be put out of, -- we will not miss the
full holy-day service.''

<p/>' Oh, yes ; that will be the comfort.''

<p/>' One other thing. Amy. You know I have hardly a friend
of my own ; but there is one person I should like to ask, --
Markham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has been so kind, and so much attached to me ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) loved my father so devotedly, and suffered so much at his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
death, that it is a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) should not be made happy ; and very
happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``svill be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' And there is one person I should like to ask, Guy, if mamma
thinks we can do it. I am sure little Marianne ought to be one
of my bridesmaids. Charlotte would take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and it
would be very nice to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''



<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII

<p/>But no kind influence deign they shower,
Till pride be quelled and love be free. -- Scott

<p/>KiLCORAN was about twenty miles from Cork, and Captain
Morville was engaged to go and spend a day or two there.
Maurice de Courcy drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) thither, Avishing all the way for
some other companion, since no one ever ventured to smoke a
cigar in the proximity of ' Morville ' ; and, besides, Maurice's
conversational powers were obliged to be entirely bestowed on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) horse and dog, for the captain, instead of, as usual, devoting
himself to suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) audience, was wrapped in the deepest
meditation, now and then taking out a letter and referring to it.

<p/>This letter was the reply jointly compounded by Mr. Edmon-
stone and Charles, and the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) consideration was,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should accept the invitation to the wedding. Charles
had taken care fully to explain how the truth respecting the
cheque liad come out, and Philip could no longer suspect that
it had been a fabrication of Dixon's ; but while Guy persisted
in denial of any answer about the thousand pounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thouglit
the renewal of the engagement extremely imprudent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
very sorry for poor little Amy, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) comfort and happiness
were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought, placed in the utmost jeopardy, witli such a
hot temper, under the most favourable circumstances ; and



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 281

<p/>there was the further peril, that when the novelty of the life
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at Redclyffe had passed off, Guy might seek for excite-
ment in the dissipation to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle had probably already
introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). In the four years' probation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw the only
hope of steadying C!uy, or of saving Amy ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was much
concerned at the rejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) advice, entirely for their sakes,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not condescend to be affronted at the scornful,
satirical tone towards himself, in which Charles's little spiteful-
nes8 was so fully apparent.

<p/>The wedding was a regular sacrifice, and Amabel was nothing
but a victim ; but an invitation to Hollywell had a charm for
him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) scarcely could resist. To see Laura again, after
having parted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) thought, for so many years, delighted him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)
in anticipation ; and it would manifest his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) real interest in liis
young cousins, and show that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) was superior to taking offence
at the folly of Charles or his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father.

<p/>These were his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) first thoughts and inclinations ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) second
were, that it was contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) principles to sanction so foolish
and hasty a marriage by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) presence ; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should thus be
affording a triumph to Guy, and to one who would use it less
moderately -- to Charles, It would be more worthy of himself,
more consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole course of conduct, to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
presence, instead of going amongst them when they were all in-
fatuated, and unable to listen to sober counsel. If he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) stayed
away now, when Guy should have justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opinion, they
would all own how wisely he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had acted, and would see tlie true
dignity which had refused, unlike common minds, to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
complaisance draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) into giving any sanction to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so
strongly disapproved. Laura, too, would pass through this try-
ing time better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was not distracted by watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
would understand the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) absence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could trust
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to love and comprehend him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at a distance, better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to hear the marriage-service in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) presence
without betraying herself. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wish to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) again
plead for the confession of tlieir engagement ; and, supposing
any misadventure should lead to its betrayal, what could be
more unpleasant than for it to be revealed at such a time, when
Cliarles would so turn it against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) influence and
usefulness would be for ever at an end ?

<p/>Love drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one way, and consistency anotlier.

<p/>Captain Morville had never been so much in the condition of
Mahomet's coffin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) life ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) grew more angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
uncle, Charles, and Guy, for having put him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in so unpleasant a
predicament. So the self -debate lasted all the way to Kilcoran ;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) only had two comforts -- one, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) had sent the follower
who was always amenable to good advice, safe out of the way of
Lady Eveleen, to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) leave of absence at Thorndale -- the
other, that Maurice de Courcy was, as yet, ignorant of the Holly-
well news, and did not torment him (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) by talking about it.

<p/>This satisfaction, however, lasted no longer than till their



<p/>282 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFPE

<p/>arrival at Kilcoran ; for, the instant they entered the drawing-
room, Lady Eveleen exclaimed, ' O Maurice, I have been so long-
ing for you to come ! Captain Morville, I hope you have not
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), for I can't flatter myself to be beforehand with you,
now at least.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has told me notliing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maurice/Maurice de Courcy/de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Maurice; `indeed, such bad
company has seldom been seen as he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) has been all the way.''

<p/>' You don't mean that you don't know it ! How delightful !
O, mamma ! think of knowing something Captain Morville does
not ! '

<p/>' I am afraid I cannot flatter you so far,'' said Philip, knowing
this was no place for allowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) real opinion to be guessed.

<p/>' Then you do know 1 ' said Lady Kilcoran, sleepily ; ' I am
sure it is a subject of great rejoicing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is it, Eva? Make haste and tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maurice/Maurice de Courcy/de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Maurice.

<p/>' No ; you must guess ! '

<p/>' Why, you would not be in such a way about it if it was not
a wedding.''

<p/>' Right, Maurice ; now, who is it ? '

<p/>' One of the Edmonstones, I suppose. ``Tis Laura 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wrong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, not Laura? I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would have been off first.
Somebody's got no taste, then, for Laura is the prettiest girl I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! your heart has escaped breaking this time, Maurice. It is
that little puss. Amy, that has made a great conquest. Now guess.''

<p/>' Oh 1 young Morville, of course. But what possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) to
take Amy, and leave Laura ? '

<p/>' Perhaps Laura was not to be had. Men are so self-suflicient,
that they always think they may pick and choose. Is it not so.
Captain Morville ? I like Sir Guy better than most men, but
Laura is too good for any one I know. If I could make a perfect
hero, I would at once ; only Charles would tell me all the perfect
heroes in books are bores. How long have you known of it.
Captain Morville ? '

<p/>' For the last ten days.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you never mentioned it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know whether they intended to publish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>' Now, Captain Morville, I hope to make some progress in your
good opinion. Of course, you believe I can't keep a secret ; but
what do you think of my having known it ever since last summer,
and held my tongue all that time ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A great effort, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``It would have
been greater, I suppose, if the engagement had been positive,
not conditional.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! every one knew what it must come to. No one could
have tlie least fear of Sir Guy. Yes ; I saw it all. I ga\e my
little aid, and I am sure I have a riglit to be bridesmaid, as I am
to be. Oh ! won't it be charming ? It is to be the grandest
wedding that ever was seen. It is to be on Whit- Tuesday ; and



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 283

<p/>papa is going to take me and Aunt Charlotte ; for old Aunt
Mabel says Aunt Charlotte must go. There are to be six brides-
maids, and a great party at the breakfast ; everything as sj^lendid
as possible ; and I made Mrs. Edmonstone promise from the first
that we should have a ball. You must go, Maurice.''

<p/>' I shall be on the high seas ! '

<p/>* Oh yes, that is horrid ! But you don't sail with the regiment,
I think, Captain Morville. You surely go 1 '

<p/>' I am not certain,'' said Philip ; especially disgusted by hearing
of the splendour, and thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had supposed Guy would
have had more sense ; and it showed how silly Amy really was,
since she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was evidently only anxious to enjoy the full para-
phernalia of a bride.

<p/>' Not certain ! ' exclaimed Maurice and Eveleen, in a breath.

<p/>' I am not sure that I shall have time. You know I have been
intending to make a walking tour through Switzerland before
joining at Corfu.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you really would prefer going by yourself-^''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>apart,
unfriended, melancholy, slow.'' '

<p/>' Very slow, indeed,'' said Maurice.

<p/>' A wedding is a confused melancholy affair,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' You
know I am no dancing man. Lady Eveleen ; one individual like
myself can make little difference to persons engrossed with their
own affairs ; I can wish my cousins well from a distance as well
as at hand ; and though they have been kind enough to ask me,
I think that while their house is overflowing with guests of more
mark, my room will be preferred to my company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then you do not mean to go ? ' said Lady Kilcoran. ' I do
not,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) continued, ' for my health is never equal to so much
excitement, and it would only be giving poor Mrs. Edmonstone
additional trouble to have to attend to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' So you really mean to stay away ? ' said Eveleen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not entirely decided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>' At any rate you must go and tell old Aunt Mabel all about
them,'' said Eveleen. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is so delighted. You will be quite
worshipped, at the cottage, for the very name of Morville. I
spend whole hours in discoursing on Sir Guy's perfections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip could not refuse ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings towards Guy were not
warmed by the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had to go through, wlien conducted to
the cottage, where lived old Lady Mabel Edmonstone and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
daughter, and there required to dilate on Guy's excellence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was not wanted to speak of any of the points where his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conscience
would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) give a favourable report ; it was quite enough
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to tell of Guy's agreeable manners and musical talents,
and to describe the beauty and extent of Redclyffe. Lady Mabel
and Miss Edmonstone were transported ; and the more Philip saw
of the light and superficial way in which the marriage was con-
sidered, the more unwilling he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) became to confound himself with
such people by eagerness to be present at'' it, and to join in the
festivities. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exercised great forbearance in not allowing



<p/>284 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>one word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disapproval or misgivings to escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; no
censure was uttered, ar d Lady Eveleen herself could not make
out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rejoiced or not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was grave and philosophical,
superior to nonsensical mirth, that was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) saw ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
made himself very agreeable throughout hia visit, by taking con-
descending interest in all that was going on, and especially to
Lady Eveleen, by showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) worthy of rational
converse.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made himself useful, as usual. Lord Kilcoran wanted a
tutor for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) two youngest boys, and it had been proposed to send
them to Mr. Wellwood, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) curacy at Coombe Prior, He (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) wished
to know what Captain Morville thought of tlie plan ; and Philip,
thinking that Mr. Wellwood had been very inattentive to Guy's
proceedings at St. Mildred's, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
considered it very fortunate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had a different plan to recom-
mend. One of the officers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) regiment had lately had staying
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a brother who had just left Oxford, and was looking out
for a tutorship, a very clever and agreeable young man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
liked particularly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strongly advised Lord Kilcoran to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sons under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eye, and place tliem under the care of this
gentleman. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advice, especially when enforced by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presence,
was almost sure to prevail, and thus it was in the present case.

<p/>The upshot of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought worse and worse
of the sense of the whole Edmonstone connection, -- considered
that it would be of no use for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go to Hollywell, -- adhered
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) second resolution, and wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle a calm and lofty
letter, free from all token of offence, expressing every wish for the
hapjDiness of Guy and Amabel, and thanking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uncle for the in-
vitation, which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought it best to decline, much as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) regretted losing the opportunity of seeing Hollywell and its
inhabitants again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) regiment would sail for Corfu either in
May or June ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) intended, himself, to tra\ el on foot through
Germany and Italy, and would write again before quitting Ireland.

<p/>' So,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' there were at the marriage the Picanninies,
and the Joblillies, and the Garryulies, but not the grand Pan-
jandrum himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Nor the little round button at top ! ' rejoined Charlotte.

<p/>' Well, it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own look out,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone. ' It is of
a piece with all the rest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure we don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in this humour,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Amy said nothing ; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not allow lierself to avow
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) absence was a relief, it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw it was a
grief and disaj^pointment to Guy.

<p/>Laura was, of course, very much mortihcd, -- almost beyond the
power of concealment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would Iiave come for the
sake of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had reckoned so much on this meeting
that it was double vexation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
missing by not coming ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), for writing
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was impossible, without the underhand dealings to which



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 285

<p/>they would never, either of them, have recourse. So much for
herself ; and liis perseverance in disapproval, in spite of renewed
explanation, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) more anxious and sorry on Amy's account.
Very mournful were poor Laura's sensations ; but there was no
remedy but to try to bewilder and drive them away in the bustle
of preparation,

<p/>-LRB-xuy had to go and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) degree, and then return to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
own -RSB--RRB-reparations at RedclyfFe. Amy begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would like, to leave things alone as much as possible ; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could
not bear old places to be pulled to pieces to suit new-comers ;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should like to find it just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been used to it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) smiled, and said, ' It should only be made habitable.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
must have a morning-room, about which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would consult Mrs.
Ashf ord : and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would choose her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashf</b></font>) piano himself. The great draw-
ing-room had never been unpacked since his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) grandmother's time,
so that must be in repair ; and, as for a garden, they would lay
it out together. There could not be much done ; for though they
did not talk of it publicly, lest they should shock Mr. Edmonstone,
they meant to go home directly after their marriage.

<p/>To Oxford, then, went Guy ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) second letter announced that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had done tolerably well on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) examination ; and it came round
to the Edmonstones, that it was a great pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had not gone up
for honours, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would certainly have distinguished himself.

<p/>RedclyfFe was, of course, in a state of great excitement at the
news that Sir Guy was going to be married. Markham was very
grand with the letter that announced it, and could find nothing
to grumble about but that the lad was very young, and it was
lucky it was no worse.

<p/>Mrs. Ashford was glad it was so good a connection, and ob-
tained all the intelligence she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) could from James Thorndale, who
spoke warmly of the HoUywell family in general ; and, in parti-
cular, said that the young ladies looked after schools and poor
people, -- that Miss Edmonstone was very handsome and clever -- •
a very superior person ; but as to Miss Amabel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) did not know
that there was anything to say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was just like
other young ladies, and very attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) invalid brother.

<p/>Markham's enmity to Mr. Ashford had subsided at the bidding
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) master ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) one day, with great cordi-
ality, that Sir Guy would be at home the next. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was to
sleep that night at Coombe Prior, and ride to RedclyfFe in the
morning ; and, to the great delight of the boys, it was at the
parsonage door that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dismounted.

<p/>Mrs. Ashford looked up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bright face, and saw no more
of the shade that had perplexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) last winter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cheeks
were deeper red as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) warmly shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; and then
the children sprung upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for their old games, -- the boys
claiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) promise, with all their might, to take them out to
the Shag. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) wondered when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) should venture to talk to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) about Miss Amabel.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) next went to find Markham, and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)



<p/>286 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) house, Markham was too happy not to grunt and
grumble more than ever.

<p/>' Well, Sir Guy ; so here you are ! You've lost no time about
it, however. A fine pair of young housekeepers, and a pretty
example of early marriages for the parish ! '

<p/>Guy laughed. ' You must come and see the example, Mark-
ham. I have a message from Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, to ask
you to come to HoUywell at Whitsuntide.''

<p/>Grunt ! ' You are making a fool of me, Sir Guy. What's a
plain old man like me to do among all your lords and ladies, and
finery and flummery 1 I'll do no such thing.''

<p/>' Not to oblige me 1 '

<p/>* Oblige you ? Nonsense ! Much you'll care for me ! '

<p/>' Nay, Markham, you must not stay away. You, my oldest
and best friend, -- my only home friend. I owe all my present
happiness to you, and it would really be a great disappointment
to me if you did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) wishes it, too.''

<p/>' Well, Sir Guy,<div class="bookquote">'' and the grunt was of softer tone, * if you do
choose to make a fool of me, I can't help it. You must have your
own way ; though you might have found a friend that would
do you more credit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy grunt</b></font>)</div><p/>* Then I may say that you will come 1 '

<p/>' Say I am very much obliged to Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone
for their invitation. It is very handsome of them.''

<p/>' Then you will have the settlements ready by that time. You
must, Markham.''

<p/>' I'll see about it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the house must be ready to come home to at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>' You don't know what you are talking of, Sir Guy ! ' ex-
claimed Markham, at once aghast and angry.

<p/>' Yes, I do. We don't intend to turn the house upside down
with new furniture.''

<p/>' You may talk as you please. Sir Guy ; but I know what's
what; and it is mere nonsense to talk of bringing a lady to a
house in this condition. A pretty notion you have of what is
fit for your bride ! I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) knows what sort of care you mean
to take of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) will be satisfied,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) particularly wishes not
to have everything disarranged. I only must have two rooms
furnished for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>' But the place wants painting from head to foot ; and the
roof is in such a state -- '

<p/>' The roof ? That's serious ! '

<p/>' Serious ! I believe so. You'll have it about your ears in no
time, if you don't look sharp.''

<p/>' I'll look this minute,'' said Guy, jumping up. ' Will you come
with me ? '

<p/>Up he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went, climbing about in the forest of ancient timbers,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not but be convinced that there was more reason
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could wish in what Markham said, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) roof



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 287

<p/>was in no condition to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) bride to. Indeed it was pro-
bable tliat it had never been thoroughly repaired since the time
of old Sir Hugh, for the Morvilles liad not been wont to lay out
money on what did not make a display. Guy was in dismay •
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sent for the builder from IVIoorworth ; calculated times and
costs ; but, do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not persuade himself that
when once the workmen were in Redclyffe, they would be out
again before the autumn.

<p/>Guy was very busy during the fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spent at home.
There were the builder and his (<font color='blue'><b>builder</b></font>) plans, and Markham and the
marriage settlements, and there were orders to be given about
the furniture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) came to Mrs. Ashford about this, conducted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) to the park, and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) to be so kind as to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) coun-
sellor, and to superintend the arrangement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) what
was to be Amy's morning-room -- now bare and empty, but with
the advantages of a window looking south, upon the green
wooded slope of the park, with a view of the church tower, and
of the moors, which were of very fine form. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) owned himself
to be profoundly ignorant about upholstery matters, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
ideas of furniture seemed to consist in prints for the walls, a
piano, a bookcase, and a couch for Charles.

<p/>' You have heard about Charles ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bright
face from the list of needful articles which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was writing, using
the window-seat as a table.

<p/>' Not much,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Ashford. * Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) entirely confined to
the sofa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cannot move without crutches ; but no one could guess
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is so patient, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) spirits
never flag ; and it is beautiful to see how considerate he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is, and
what interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) takes in all the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never can share, poor
fellow. I don't know what Holly well would be without Charlie !
I wonder how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) will be able to come here ! Hardly this
year, I am afraid, for things must be comfortable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ; and
I shall never get them so without Amy, and then it will be
autumn. Well, what next? Oh, you said window-curtains.
Some blue sort of stufi'', I suppose, like the drawing-room ones at
Hollywell. What's the name of it ? '

<p/>In fact, Mrs. Ashford was much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) opinion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) never
would make things comfortable without Amy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) gave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) best attention to the inquiries that were continually made of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) ; and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had an idea, carried it out to the utmost.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) knew much better what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was about in the arrangements
for Coombe Prior, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had installed his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) friend, Mr. Well-
wood, and set on foot many plans for improvements, giving them
as much attention as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had nothing else to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mind.
Both the curate and Markham were surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) did not
leave these details till his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) return home ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) answered, --

<p/>' Better do things while we may. The thought of this unhappy
place is enough to poison everything ; and I don't think I could
rest without knowing that the utmost was being done for it.''



<p/>288 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was very happy making arrangements for a village feast
on the wedding-day. The Ashfords asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would not put
it off till his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) return, and preside himself.

<p/>' It won't hurt them to have one first. Let them make sure
of all the fun they can/ he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) answered ; and the sentiment was
greatly applauded by Edward and Robert, who followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
about more than ever, and grew so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), that it made
them very angry to be reminded of the spirit of defiance in which
their acquaintance had begun. Nevertheless they seemed to be
preparing the same spirit for his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife, for when their mother
told them they must not expect to monopolize him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thus when
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was married, they declared, that they did not want a Lady
Morville at all, and could not think why he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was so stupid as to
want a wife.

<p/>Their father predicted that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would never have time to fulfil
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old engagement of taking them out to the Shag Rock ; but
the prediction was not verified, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rowed both them and Mr.
Ashford thither one fine May afternoon, showed them all they
wanted to see, and let them scramble to their heart's content.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) laughed at their hoard of scraps of the wood of the wreck,
which they said their mamma had desired them to fetch for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>So many avocations came upon Guy at once, -- so many of the
neighbours came to call on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), -- such varieties of people wanted
to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), -- the boys followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so constantly, -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
liad so many invitations from Mr. Wellwood and the Ashfords,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) never had any time for himself, except what must be
spent in writing to Amabel. There was a feeling upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) must have time to commune with himself, and rest from this
turmoil of occupation, in the solitude of which Redclyfie had
hitherto been so full. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) wanted to be alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) old home,
and take leave of it, and of the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) boyhood, before
beginning on this new era of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) life ; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) set out
for a solitary walk, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) could even get to the top of the
crag, either Markham marched up to talk over some important
question, -- a farmer waylaid him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) to make some request, -- some
cottager met him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), to tell of a grievance, -- Mr. Wellwood rode
over, -- or the Ashford boys rushed up, and followed like his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>)
shadow.

<p/>At length, on Ascension day, the last before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) was to leave
RedclyfFe, with a determination that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) would escape for once
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) pursuers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) walked to the Cove as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) returned
from morning service, launched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) little boat and pushed off
into the rippling whispering waters. It was a resumption of the
ways of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) boyhood ; it seemed like a holiday to have left all
these cares behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), just as it used to be when all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) lessons
were prepared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) had leave to disport himself, by land or
water, the whole afternoon, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) di-LRB-f not go out beyond the
Shag Rock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) sculls and rowed merrily, singing
and whistling to keep time with their dash ; the return to the
old pleasure quite enough at first, the salt breeze, the dashing



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 289

<p/>waves, the motion of tlie boat. So lie went on till he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) had come
as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) former boundary, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) turned and gazed back on
the precipitous rocks, cleft with deep fissures, marbled with veins
of different shades of red, and tufted here and therewith clumps
of samphire, grass, and a little brushwood, bright with the early
green of spring. The white foam and spray were leaping against
their base, and roaring in their hollows ; the tract of wavelets
between glittered in light, or heaved green under the shadow of
the passing clouds ; the sea-birds floated smoothly in sweeping
undulating lines,

<p/>As though life's only call and care
Were graceful motion ;

<p/>the hawks poised themselves high in air near the rocks. The
Cove lay in sunshine, its rough stone chimneys and rude slate
roofs overgrown with moss and fern, rising rapidly, one above
the other, in the fast descending hollow, through which a little
stream rushed to the sea, -- more quietly than its brother, which,
at some space distant, fell sheer down over the crag in a white
line of foam, brawling with a tone of its own, distinguishable
among all the voices of the sea contending with the rocks.
Above the village, in the space where the outline of two hills met
and crossed, rose the pinnacled tower of the village church, the
unusual height of which was explained by the old custom of
lighting a beacon-fire on its summit, to serve as a guide to the
boats at sea. Still higher, apparently on the very brow of the
beetling crag that frowned above, stood the old Gothic hall,
crumbling and lofty, a fit eyrie for the eagles of Morville. The
sunshine was indeed full upon it ; but it served to show how
many of the dark windows were without the lining of blinds and
curtains, that alone gives the look of life and habitation to a
house. How crumbled by sea-wind were the old walls, and the
aspect altogether full of a dreary haughtiness, suiting with the
whole of the stories connected with its name, from the time when
it was said the very dogs crouched and fled from the presence of
the sacrilegious murderer of the Archbishop, to the evening when
the heir of the line lay stretched a corpse before his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) father's gate.

<p/>Guy sat resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) oars, gazing at the scene, full of happi-
ness, yet with a sense that it might be too bright to last, as if it
scarcely befitted one like himself. The l^liss before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), though
it was surely a beam from heaven, was so much above him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hardly dared to believe it real : like a child repeating, ' Is it
my own, my very own 1 ' and pausing before it will venture to
grasp at a prize beyond its hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feared to trust himself
fully, lest it should carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) self-discipline, and
dazzle him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) too much to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gaze on the light
beyond ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rejoiced in this time of quiet, to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to
strive for power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind, to prevent hiniself from losing in
gladness the balance he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had gained in adversity.

<p/>It was such a check as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might have wished for, to look at
that grim old castle, recollect who he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was, and think of the frail

<p/>U



<p/>290 THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>tenure of all earthly joy, especially for one of the house of
Morville. Could tliat abode ever be a home for a creature like
Amy, with the bright innocent mirtli tliat seemed too soft and
sweet ever to be overshadowed by gloom and sorrow 1 Perhaps
slie miglit be early taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) in tlie undimmed beauty of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) happiness and innocence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) might have to struggle
through a long lonely life wdth only the remembrance of a short-
lived joy to lighten it ; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) reflected that this was only
a melancholy fancy, the answer came from within, that tliere was
nothing peculiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) in the joerception that earthly happiness
was fleeting. It was best tliat so it should be, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) should
rest in the trust that brightened on him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) through all, -- that
neither life nor death, sorrow nor pain, could separate, for ever,
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) Amy.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) looked up into the deep blue sky overhead, murmur-
ing to himself, ' In heart and mind thither ascend, and with Him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
continually dwell ; ' and gazed long and intently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) rocked on
the green waters, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) again spoke to himself, -- ' Why stand ye
here gazing up into heaven 1 ' tlien pulled vigorously back to the
shore, leaving a shining wake far behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXIX

<p/>Hark, how the birds do sing,
And woods do ring !
All creatures have their joy, and man hath liis^;
Yet if we rightly measure,
Man's joy and pleasure
Rather hereafter than in present is :

<p/>Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) may not here
Taste of the cheer,
But as birds drink and straight lift up the head,
So must he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) sip and think
Of better drink
He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) may attain to after he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is dead. -- Herbfrt

<p/>Guy returned to Hollywell on the Friday, there to spend a
quiet week with them all, for it was a special deliglit to Amy
that Hollywell and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) family were as precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for their
own sakes as for hers. It was said that it was to be a quiet week
-- but with all the best efforts of iSIrs. Edmonstone and Laura to
preserve quiet, there was an amount of confusion that would
have been very disturbing, but for Amy's propensity never to
be rufiled or fluttered.

<p/>What was to be done in the honeymoon was the question for
consideration. Guy and Amy would have liked to make a tour
among the English cathedrals, pay a visit at Hollywell, and tlien
go home and live in a corner of the house till the rest was ready ;
for Amy could not see why she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should take up so much more
room than old Sir Guy, and Guy declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not see tliat
happiness Avas a reason for going pleasure-hunting ; but Cliarles
pronounced this very stupid, and Mr. Edmonstone thought a



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 291

<p/>journey on the Continent was the only proper tiling for them to
do. Mrs. Edmonstone wished Amy to see a little of the world.
Amy was known to have always desired to see Switzerland ; it
occurred to Guy that it would be a capital opportunity of taking
Arnaud to see the relations he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had been talking for the List
twenty years of visiting, and so they acquiesced ; for as Guy said,
when they talked it over together, it did not seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to come
under the denomination of pleasure-hunting, since they had not
devised it for themselves ; they had no house to go to ; they
should do Arnaud a service, and perhaps they should meet Philip.

<p/>' That will not be pleasure-hunting, certainly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; then,
remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear to hear Philip under-rated,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) added, ' I mean, unless you could convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and then it
would be more than pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It would be my first of unattained wishes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' Then
we will enjoy the journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No fear on that score.''

<p/>' And for fear we should get too much into the stream of enjoy-
ment, as people abroad forget home-duties, let us stick to some
fixed time for coming back.''

<p/>' You said Redely ffe would be ready by Michaelmas.''

<p/>' I have told the builder it must be. So, Amy, as far as it depends
on ourselves, we are determined to be at home by Michaelmas.''

<p/>All seemed surprised to find the time for the wedding so near
at hand. Charles's spirits began to flag, Amy was a greater loss
to liim than to anybody else ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could never again be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been, and unable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was to take part in the general
bustle and occupation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had more time for feeling this, much
more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother and Laura, who were employed all day.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Guy were exemplary in their civilities to each other in
not engrossing Amy, and one who had only known him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) three
years ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was all exaction and selfishness, could have
hardly believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to be the same person who was now only
striving to avoid giving pain, by showing how much it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
to yield up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could contrive to be merry, but the
difficulty was to be cheerful ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could make them all laugh in
spite of themselves, but when alone with Amy, or when hearing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) devolve on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sisters the services she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been wont to per-
form for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), it was almost more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could endure ; but then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dreaded setting Amy off into one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) silent crying-fits, for
which the only remedy was the planning a grand visit to Red-
clyffe, and talking over all the facilities of railroads and carriages.

<p/>The last day had come, and a long strange one it was ; not
exactly joyful to any, and very sad to some, though Amy, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sweet pensive face, seemed to have a serenity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own
that soothed them whenever they looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Charlotte,
though inclined to be wild and flighty, was checked and subdued
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) presence ; Laura could not be entirely wretched about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; Charles lay and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) without speaking ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father
never met her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) without kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face, anci

<p/>calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little jewel ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother -- but who could describe
Mrs. Edmonstone on that day, so full of the present pain, con-
tending with the unselhsh gladness.

<p/>Guy kept out of the way, thinking Amy ought to be left to
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own room a good while, afterwards rode to
Broadstone, in coming home made a long visit to Mr. Ross ;
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) found Charles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) wheeled chair on
the lawn, with Amy sitting on the grass by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) sat
down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and there followed a long silence, -- one of those
pauses full of meaning.

<p/>' Wlien shall we three meet again ? ' at lengtli said Charles, in
a would-be lively tone.

<p/>' And where ? ' said Amy.

<p/>' Here,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' you will come here to tell your adven-
tures, and take up Bustle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``We could not help it. The telling
you about it will be a treat to look forward to all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; your sight-seeing is a public benefit. You liave seen
many a thing for me.''

<p/>' That is the pleasure of seeing and hearing, the thing that is
not fleeting,'' said Guy.

<p/>' The unselfish part, you mean,'' said Cliarles ; and mused again,
till Guy, starting up, exclaimed--

<p/>' There are the people ! ' as a carriage came in view in tlie lane,
* Shall I wheel you home, Charlie ? '

<p/>' Yes, do.''

<p/>Guy leant over the back, and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) along ; and as lie did
so murmured in a low tremulous tone, ' Wlierever or whenever
we may be destined to meet, Charlie, or if never again, I must
thank you for a great part of my happiness here -- for a great deal
of kindness and sympathy.''

<p/>Charles looked straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and answered -- ' The kind-
ness was all on your part. I had nothing to give in return -RSB--RRB-ut
ill -temper and exactions. But, Guy, you must not tliink I liave
not felt all you have done for me. You have made a new man of
me, instead of a wretched stick, laughing at my misery, to per-
suade myself and others that I did not feel it. I hope you are
proud of it.''

<p/>' As if I had anything to do with it ! '

<p/>' Hadn't you, that's all ! I know what you won't deny, at any
rate -- what a capital man-of -all-work you liave been to me, when
I had no right to ask it, as now we have,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, smiling,
because Amy was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but not making a very success-
ful matter of the smile. ' When you come back, you'll see me
treat you as indeed ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>a man and a brother.'' '

<p/>This talk retarded them a little, and they did not reach the
house till the guests were arriving. The first sight that met the
eyes of Aunt Charlotte and Lady Eveleen as they entered, was,
in the frame of the open window, Guy's light agile figure, assist-
ing Charles up the step, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brilliant hazel eyes and glowing



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 293

<p/>healtliy complexion contrasting with Charles's pale, fair, deli-
cate face, and features sharpened and relined by suffering. Amy,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) deep blushes and downcast eyes almost hidden by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) glossy
curls, stood just behind, carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother's crutch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Edmonstone, springing forward
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) arms round
Amy in a warm embrace. ' My dear, dear little niece, I con-
gratulate you witli all my heart, and that I do.''

<p/>' I'll spare your hot cheeks. Amy dearest ! ' whispered Eveleen,
as Amy joassed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) embrace ; while Aunt Charlotte hastily
kissed Charles, and proceeded -- ``I don't wait for an introduction;'
and vehemently shook hands with Guy.

<p/>' Ay, did I say a word too much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) praise ? ' said Mr. Edmon-
stone. ' Isn't ho all out as fine a fellow as I told you ? '

<p/>Guy was glad to turn away to shake hands with Lord Kilcoran,
and the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) drew Amy out of the group eagerly
talking round Charles's sofa, and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) up
to a sturdy, ruddy-brown, elderly man, who had come in at the
same time, but after the first reception had no share in the
family greetings. <div class="bookquote">``You know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), already,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy Amy</b></font>)</div>said Guy; and
Amy held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand, saying --

<p/>' Yes, I am sure I do.''

<p/>Markham was taken by surprise ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) gave a most satisfied grunt,
and shook hands as heartily as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) favourite niece.

<p/>' And the little girl ? ' said Amy.

<p/>' O yes. -- I picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) up at St. Mildred's : one of the servants
took charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in the hall.''

<p/>' I'll fetcli her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),'' cried Charlotte, as Amy was turning to the
door, and the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) led in little Marianne Dixon,
clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand. Amy kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and lield her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fast in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
arms, and Marianne looked up, consoled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bewilderment,
by the greeting of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dear old friend, Sir Guy.

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone j^atted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head ; and when the otliers had
spoken kindly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), Charlotte, under whose especial cliarge Guy
and Amy had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) off to the regions up-stairs.

<p/>Tlie rest of the evening was hurry and confusion. Mrs. Edmon-
stone was very busy, and glad to be so, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) must otherwise
have given way ; and there was Aunt Charlotte to he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) talked
to, Avhom they had not seen since Charles's illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was a
short, bustling, active person, with a joyous face, inexhaustible
good-humour, a considerable touch of Irish, and referring every-
thing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) mother, -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) one thought. Everything was to be
told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) ; and the only drawback to her (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) complete pleasure
was the anxiety lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Irish</b></font>) should be missed at home.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) the his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-
tory of the engagement, and jDraising Guy ; Amy went up as soon
as dinner was over, to take leave of old nurse, and to see little
-RSB-\Iarianne ; and Eveleen sat between Laura and Charlotte, asking
many eager questions, which were not all convenient to answer.

<p/>Why Sir Guy had not been at home at Christmas was a



<p/>294 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>query to which it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should never gain a reply '
for that Charles had been ill, and Guy at Redclyfte, was no real
answer ; and finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should not be told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wisely held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
tongue. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made an awkward inquiry --

<p/>' Now tell me, is Captain Morville pleased about this or not ? '

<p/>Laura would have been silent, trusting to Eveleen's propensity
for talking, for bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) to some speech that it might be
easier to answer, but Charlotte exclaimed, ' What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) been
saying about it ? '

<p/>' Saying ? O nothing. But why does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) come ? '

<p/>' You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) more lately than we have,'' said Laura..

<p/><div class="bookquote">``TJiat is an evasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eveleen/Lady Eveleen/Lady Eveleen de Courcy</b></font>)</div>said Eveleen ; `as if you did not know
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) mind than I could ever get at, if I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) every
day of my life.'' ^

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is provoking, that is all,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Charlotte. ' I am sure
we don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ; but Laura and Guy will both of them take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) part.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>A call came at that moment, -- the box of white gloves was
<div class="bookquote">``^me, and Laura must come and count them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would fain
have taken Charlotte with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ; but neither Charlotte nor
Eveleen appeared disposed to move, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was obliged to leave
them. Eva had already guessed that there was more chance of
hearing the facts from Charlotte, and presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knew a good
deal. Charlotte had some prudence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tliouglit she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) miglit
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own cousin what half the neighbourhood knew -- that
Philip had suspected Guy falsely, and had made papa very
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; that the engagement had been broken off, and
Guy had been banished, while all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was behaving
most gloriously. Now it was all explained ; but in spite of the
fullest certainty, Philip would not be convinced, and wanted
them to have waited five years.

<p/>Eveleen agreed with Cliarlotte that tliis was a great deal too
bad, admired Guy, and pitied Amy to lier heart's content.

<p/>' So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was banished, regularly banished ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). ' How-
ever, of course Amy never gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) never mistrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one minute.''

<p/>' And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) fast, it was little he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would care for the
rest.''

<p/>' Yes, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had known it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>Eveleen looked arch.

<p/>' But I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not,'' said Charlotte, rather angrily.

<p/>' You know nothing about it, my dear.''

<p/>' Yes, but I do ; for mamma said to Charlie how beautifully
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did behave, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) too, -- never attempting any intercourse.''

<p/>' Very good of you to believe it.''

<p/>' I am sure of it, certain sure,'' said Charlotte. ' How could you
venture to think they would either of them do anything wrong 1 '

<p/>' I did not say they would.''

<p/>' What, not to write to eacli other when papa had forbidden
it, and do so in secret, too 1 '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 295

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, don't look so innocently irate. Goodness has
nothing to do witli it, it would be only a moderate constancy.
You know nothing at all of lovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If I know nothing of lovers, I know a great deal of Amy
and Guy, and I am quite sure that nothing on earth would tempt
them to do anything in secret that they were forbidden.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Wait till you are in love, and you'll change your mind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never mean to be in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte indignantly.
Eveleen laughed the more, Charlotte grew more angry and
uncomfortable at the tone of the conversation, and was heartily
glad that it was broken off by the entrance of the gentlemen.
Guy helped Charles to the sofa, and then turned away to
continue his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) endless talk on RedclyfFe business with Markham.
Charlotte flew up to the sofa, seized an interval when no one
was in hearing, and kneeling down to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) face on a level
with lier brother's whispered -- ' Charlie, Eva won't believe but
tliat Guy and Amy kept up some intercourse last winter.''

<p/>' I can't help it, Charlotte.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) they did not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only laughs at me. Do
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) they did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I have too much self-respect to lay myself open to ridicule.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlie, you don't think it possible yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cliarlotte</b></font>)</div>exclaimed
Cliarlotte, in consternation.

<p/>' Possible -- no indeed.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will say it is not wrong, and that I know nothing of
lovers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should liave told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that ours are not commonplace
lovers, but far beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) small experience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I wish I had ! Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) so, Charlie ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) will believe you.''

<p/>' I sha'n't say one word about it.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is not worthy. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) can't appreciate them, I
would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) alone. I once thought better of Eva, but it is
very bad company she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) keeps when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) is not here.''

<p/>Charles, however, was not sorry when Eveleen came to sit by
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), for a bantering conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) was the occupation
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was most capable. Amy, returning, came and sat
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) old place beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) quiet
eyes fixed on the ground.

<p/>The last evening for many weeks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would tlius sit
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), -- the last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would ever be a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) home.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had already ceased to belong entirely to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wlio had
always been the most precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), except his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother could have been a greater loss, -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not
dwell on the anticipation ; and still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) roused
himself to listen, and answer gaily to Eveleen's description of
the tutor, Mr. Fielder, ' a thorough gentleman, very clever and
agreeable, who had read all the books in the world ; the ugliest,
yes, without exaggeration, the most quaintly ugly man living, --
little, and looking just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was made of gutta percha,''

<p/>Eveleen said, `always moving by jerks,-- so Maurice advised
the boys not to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) near the lire, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) should melt.''

<p/>' Only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) gives them some formidable lesson, and they
want to melt his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) heart,'' said Charles, talking at random, in hopes
of saying something laughable.

<p/>' Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes -- `tis not exactly a squint, but a cast there is,
and one set of eyelashes are black and the other light, and that
gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) just the air of a little frightful terrier of Maurice's
named Venus, Avith a black spot over one eye. The boys never
call -RSB-iim anything but Venus.''

<p/>' And you encourage them in respect for their tutor ? '

<p/>' Oh, lie holds his (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) own at lessons, I trow ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) pretends to
have such a horror of us wild Irish, and to wonder not to find
us eating potatoes with our lingers, and that I don't wear a
petticoat over my head instead of a bonnet, in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Maurice</b></font>) calls the
classical Carthaginian Celto-Hibernian fashion.''

<p/>' Dear me,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte, ' no wonder Philip recommended liim.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has the gift, no one else but Captain
Morville talks near as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>So talked on Eveleen, and Charles answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) as much in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own fashion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could, and wlien at last the evening came
to an end, every one felt relieved.

<p/>Laura lingered long in Amy's room, perceiving that hitherto
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had known only half the value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sweet sister.
It would be worse than ever now, when left with the others, all
so much less sympathizing, all saying sharp things of Pliilip,
none to cling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) with those winsome ways that had been
unnoted till the time when they were no more to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) felt them to have been the only charm that had softened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) late dreary desolation.

<p/>So full was her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must have told Amy all lier
grief but for the part that Philip had acted towards Guy, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) doubts of Guy would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tlie consolation of dwell-
ing on Amy's happiness, which cheered the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only
hang about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in speechless grief, and caress her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fondly, wliile
Amy cried, and tried to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), till lier mother came to
wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good night.

<p/>Airs. Edmonstone did not stay long, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wished Amy,
if possible to rest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) last kiss, <div class="bookquote">``I can't
think why I am not more unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is ail as it should be,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>Amabel slept, and awakened to the knowledge that it was lier
wedding-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was not to appear at the lirst breakfast, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) came to meet Charles in the dressing-room ; and as tliey
sat together on the sofa, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had watclied and amused so
many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hours of lielplessness, lie clasped round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ai'm
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gift, -- a bracelet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lingers trembled
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes were hazy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) help him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thanks were obliged to be all kisses, no words would come



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 297

<p/>but ' Charlie, Charlie ! liow could I ever have promised to
leave you ? '

<p/>' Nonsense ! who ever dreamt that my sisters were to be
three monkeys tied to a clog ? '

<p/>It was impossible not to smile, though it was but for a moment,
--Charles's mirth was melancholy.

<p/>' And, dear Charlie, you will not miss me so very much ; do
pray let Charlotte w^ait upon you,''

<p/>' After the first, perhaps, I may not hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). Oh, Amy, I
little knew what I was doing when I tried to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) back again
for you. I was sawing off the bough I was sitting on. But there !
I will not flatter you, you've had enough to turn that head of
yours. Stand up, and let me take a survey. Very pretty, I
declare, -- you do my education credit. There, if it will be for
your peace, I'll do my best to wear on without you. I've wanted
a brother all my life, and you are giving me the very one I would
have i^icked out of a thousand -- the only one I could forgive for
presuming to steal you, Amy. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is. Come in,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added,
as Guy knocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) door, to ofFer to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) down-stairs.

<p/>Guy hardly spoke, and Amy could net look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face. It was
late, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took down Charles at once. After this, slie had very
little quiet, every one was buzzing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and i^utting the last
touches to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dress ; at last, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was quite finished,
Charlotte exclaimed, ' Oh, there is Guy's step ; may I call him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
in to have one look 1 '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone did not say no ; and Charlotte, opening the
dressing-room door, called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood opposite to Amy
for some moments, then said, with a smile, ' I was wrong about
the grogram ; I would not for anything see you look otherwise
than you do.''

<p/>It seemed to Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura that these words
made them lose sight of the details of lace and silk that had been
occupying them, so that they only saw the radiance, purity, and
innocence of Amy's bridal appearance. No more was said, for
Mr. Edmonstone ran up to call Guy, who was to drive Charles
in the j^ony-carriage.

<p/>Amabel, of course, went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) parents. Poor child ! her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
tears flowed freely on the way, and Mr. Edmonstone, now that
it liad really come to the point of parting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little Amy,
was very much overcome, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife, hardly refraining from
tears, could only hold her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter's hand very close.

<p/>The regular morning service was a great comfort, by restoring
their tranquillity, and by tlie time it was ended, Amabel's coun-
tenance had settled into its own calm expression of trust and
serenity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) scarcely even trembled when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) father led lier
forward ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand did not shake, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) voice, though very
low, was firm and audible ; while Guy's deep, sweet tones had a
sort of thrill and quiver of intense feeling.

<p/>No one could help obser\`ing that Laura was the most agitated
person present ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) trembled so much tliat she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was obliged to



<p/>298 THE HEIR .OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>lean on Charlotte, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tears gave the infection to the other
bridesmaids -- all but Mary Ross, who could never cry when
other people did, and little Marianne, who did nothing but look
and wonder.

<p/>Mary was feeling a great deal, both of compassion for the
bereaved family and of affectionate admiring joy for tlie young
pair who knelt before the altar. It was a showery day, with
gleams of vivid sunshine, and one of these suddenly broke forth,
casting a stream of colour from a martyr's figure in the south
window, so as to shed a golden glory on the wave of brown hair
over Guy's forehead, then passing on and tinting the bride's
white veil with a deep glowing shade of crimson and purple.

<p/>Either that golden light, or the expression of the face on which
it beamed, made Mary think of tlie lines --

<p/>Where is the brow to wear in mortal's sight,
The crown of pure angelic light?

<p/>Charles stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head leaning against a pillar as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
could not bear to look up ; Mr. Edmonstone was restless and
almost sobbing ; Mrs. Edmonstone alone collected, though mucli
flushed and somewhat trembling, while the only person apparently
free from excitement was the little bride, as there she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) knelt, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
hand clasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>),lier head bent down, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) modest, steadfast face
looking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) was only conscious of the vow she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) exchanged, the
blessing she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) received ; and was, as it were, lifted out of herself.

<p/>It was over now. The feast, in its fullest sense, was held, and
the richest of blessings had been called down on them.

<p/>The procession came out of the vestry in full order, and very
pretty it was ; the bride and bridegroom in the fresh bright
graciousness of their extreme youth, and the six bridesmaids
following ; Laura and Lady Eveleen, two strikingly liandsome
and elegant girls ; Charlotte, with the pretty little fair Marianne ;
Mary Ross, and Grace Harper. The village people who stood
round might well say that such a sight as that was worth coming
twenty miles to see.

<p/>The first care, after the bridal pair had driven off, was to put
Charles into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pony-carriage, Charlotte, who had just pinned
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) favour, begged to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) meant to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) especial charge, and to succeed to all Amy's rights.
Mrs. Edmonstone asked whether Laura would not prefer going
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hastily answered, ' No, thank you, let Charlotte ;'
for with lier troubled feelings, slie could better answer talking
girls than parry the remarks of lier shrewd, observant brother.

<p/>Some one said it would rain, but Charlotte still pleaded
earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, then, puss,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, rallying liis spirits, `only
don't upset me, or it will spoil their tour.''

<p/>Charlotte drove off with elaborate care, -- then came a deep
sigh, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) exclaimed, ' Well ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is our brother, and all is safe.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles ; `no more fears for them.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 299

<p/>' Had you any ? I am very glad if you had.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whyr

<p/>' Because it was so like a book. I had a sort of feeling, all the
time, that Philip would come in quite grand and terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must act Ogre. I am not sure that I had not some-
thing of the same notion,-- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might appear suddenly, and
forlnd the banns, entirely for Amy's sake, and as the greatest
kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' However, lie can't separate them now, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) worst,
and while Amy is Guy's wife, I don't think we shall easily be
made to quarrel. I am glad the knot is tied, for I had a fatality
notion that the feud was so strong, that it was nearly a case of
the mountains^ bending and the streams ascending, ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
to be our foeman's bride.''

<p/>' No,'' said Charlotte, ' it ought to be like that story of Rosaura
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) kindred, don't you remember ? The fate would not be
appeased by the marriage, till Count Julius had saved the life of
one of the hostile race. That would be it, -- perhaps they will
meet abroad, and Guy will do it!

<p/>' That won't do. Philip will never endanger his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) precious life,
nor ever forgive Guy tlie obligation. Well, I sujDpose there
never was a prettier wedding -- how silly of me to say so, I shall
be sick of hearing it before night.''

<p/>' I do wish all these people were gone ; I did not know it would
be so horrid. I should like to shut myself up and cry, and think
what I could ever do to wait on you. Indeed, Charlie, I know I
never can be like Amy, but if you -- '

<p/>' Be anything but sentimental ; I don't want to make a fool
of myself,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, with a smile and tone as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
keeping sorrow at bay. ' Depend upon it if we were left to
ourselves this evening, we should be so desperately savage that
we should quarrel furiously, and there would be no Amy to set
us to rights.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div><p/>' How Aunt Charlotte did cry ! What a funny little woman
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is.''

<p/>' Yes, I see now who you take after, puss. You'll be just like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) when you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) age.''

<p/>' So I mean to be, -- I mean to stay and take care of you all my
life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does of grandmamma.''

<p/>' You do, do you ?''

<p/>' Yes. I never mean to marry, it is so disagreeable. O dear 1
But how lovely dear Amy did look.''

<p/>' Here's the rain ! ' exclaimed Charles, as some large drops
began to fall in good time to prevent them from being either
savage or sentimental, though at the expense of Charlotte's pink
and white ; for they had no umbrella, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would not accept
a share of Charles's carriage-cloak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) laughed, and drove on
fast through the short cut, and arrived at the house-door, just as
the pelting hail was over, having battered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thin sleeves, and



<p/>300 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>made her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) white bonnet look very deplorable. The first tiling
they saw was Guy, with Bustle close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), for Bustle had found
out that something was going on that concerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) master, and
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) about more assiduously than ever, as if sensible of
the decree, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) was to be left behind to Charlotte's care.

<p/>' Charlotte, how wet you are.''

<p/>' Never mind, Charlie is not.'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sprung out, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
hand, and felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could never forget that moment when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) new brother lirst kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brow.

<p/>' Where's Amy ? '

<p/>' Here ! ' and while Guy lifted Charles out, Charlotte was
clasped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister's arms.

<p/>' Are you wet, Charlie 1 '

<p/>' No, Charlotte would not be wise, and made me keep the
cloak to myself.''

<p/>' You are wet through, poor child ; come up at once, and
change,'' said Amy, flying nind:-RRB-ly up the stairs,-- up even to
Charlotte's own room, the old nursery, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was un-
fastening the drenched finery.

<p/>' O Amy, don't do all this. Let me ring.''

<p/>' No, the servants are either not come home or are too busy.
Charles won't want me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has Guy. Can I find your white
frock?''

<p/>' Oh, but Amy -- let me see ! ' Charlotte made prisoner the
left hand, and looked up with an arch smile at the face where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had called up a blush. ' Lady Morville must not begin by
being lady<div class="bookquote">``s-maid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me-- let me, Charlotte, dear, I sha'n't be able to do
anything for you this long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>Amy's voice trembled, and
Charlotte held her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fast to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) again.

<p/>' We must make haste,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, recovering herself. ' There
are the carriages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>While the frock was being fastened, Charlotte looked into the
Prayer-book Amy had laid down. There was the name, Amabel
Frances Morville, and the date.

<p/>' Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Frances</b></font>) just written it?'' said Charlotte.

<p/>' Yes ; when we came home.''

<p/>' O Amy ! dear, dear Amy ; I don't know whether I am glad
or sorry ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I am both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy.

<p/>At that moment Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura hastened in.
Then was the time for broken words, tears and smiles, as Amy
leant against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother, who locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in a close embrace, and
gazed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in a sort of trance, at once of maternal pride and of
pain, at giving up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cherished nestling. Poor Laura ! how
bitter Avere her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tears, and how forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) smiles, -- far unlike the
rest !

<p/>No one would care to hear the details of the breakfast, and
the splendours of the cake ; how Charlotte recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) spirits
while distributing the favours : and Lady Eveleen set up a



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 301

<p/>flirtation witli Markliaiii, and forced Jiim into wearing one,
though -RSB-ie jirotested, with many a grunt, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was making
a queer fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) ; liow often Cliarles was obliged to hear it
had been a i3retty wedding ; and how well Lord Kilcoran made
liis speech proposing the health of tSir G!uy and Lady Morville.
All tlie time, Laura was active and useful, -- feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
was acting a play, sustaining the character of Miss -RSB-lldmonstone,
the bridesmaid at her (<font color='blue'><b>bridesmaid</b></font>) sister's hapj^y marriage ; while the true
Laura, Philip's Laura, was lonely, dejected, wretched ; half
fearing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sistei', half jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) happiness, forced into
pageantry with an acliing heart, -- with only one wish, that it
was over, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) might be again alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) burden.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was glad when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother rose, and the ladies moved into
the drawing-room, -- glad to escape from Eveleen's quick eye,
and to avoid Mary's clear sense, -- glad to talk to comparative
strangers, -- glad of the occupation of going to prepare Amabel
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) journey. This lasted a long time,^ -- there was so much
to be said, and hearts were so full, and Amy over again ex-
plained to Charlotte how to perform all the little services to
Charles wliich she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) relinquished ; while her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother had so many
affectionate last words, and every now and then stopped short to
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) little daughter, saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not know if it was
not a dream.

<p/>At length Amabel was dressed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) purple and white shot
silk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) muslin mantle, and white bonnet. Mrs. Edmonstone
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) and Laura to have a few words together, and went to
the dressing-room. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) found Guy, leaning on the mantel-
shelf, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to do when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) troubles to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
started as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) entered.

<p/>' Ought I not to be here 1 ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said. ' I could not help coming
once more. This room has always been the kernel of my home,
my happiness here.''

<p/>' Indeed, it has been a very great pleasure to have you liere.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been very kind to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) proceeded, in a low,
reflecting tone. ``You have helj^ed me very much, very often ;
even when -- ■ Do you remember the day I begged you to keep
me in order, as if I were Charles 1 I did not think then -- •'

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was silent ; and Mrs. Edmonstone little able to find words,
smiling, tried to say, -- ' I little thought how truly and how gladly
I should be able to call you my son ; ' and ended by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
a mother's kiss.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could tell vou half,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, -- `half what I feel for
the kindness that made a home to one who had no right to any.
Coming as a stranger, I found -- '

<p/>' We found one to love with all our hearts,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmon-
stone. ' I have often looked back, and seen that you brouglit
a brightness to us all -- especially to poor Charles. Yes ; it dates
from your coming ; and I can only wish and trust, Guy, that
the same brightness will rest on your own home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' There must be brightness where she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) is,'' said Guy.



<p/>302 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I need not tell you to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone,
smiling. ' I think I can trust you ; but I feel rather as I did when
first I sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) and Laura to a party of pleasure by themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura at this moment came in. Alone with Amy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could
not speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could only cry ; and fearful of distressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) came away ; but here, with Guy, it was worse, for it
was unkind not to speak one warm word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Yet what could
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) say 1 He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke first -- •

<p/>' Laura, you must get up your looks again, now this turmoil
is over. Don't do too much mathematics, and wear yourself
down to a shadow.''

<p/>Laura gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sad, forced smile.

<p/>' Will you do one thing for me, Laura ? I should like to have
one of your perspective views of the inside of the church. Would
it be too troublesome to do ? '

<p/>' Oh, no ; I shall be very glad.''

<p/>' Don't set about it till you quite like it, and have plenty of
time. Thank you. I shall think it is a proof that you can
forgive me for all the pain I am causing you. I am very sorry,
indeed -- '

<p/>' You are so very kind,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, bursting into tears ; and,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not help adding, ' but don't
try to comfort me, Guy ; don't blame yourself, -- `tisn't only
that, -- but I am so very, very unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy told me you were grieved for Philip. I wish I could
help it, Laura. I want to try to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in Switzerland ; and,
if we can, perhaps it may be set right. At any rate lie will be
glad to know you see the rights of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura wept still more ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could never again lose the
sisterly feeling those kind words had awakened. If Philip had
but known what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) missed !

<p/>Charlotte ran in. ' Oh, I am glad to find you here, Guy ; I
wanted to put you in mind of your i^romise. You must write me
the first letter you sign <div class="bookquote">'' Your affectionate brother ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>' I won't forget, Charlotte.''

<p/>' Guy ! Where's Guy 1 ' called Mr. Edmonstone. ' The rain's
going off. You must come down, both of you, or you'll be
too late.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone hastened to call Amabel. Those moments
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been alone, Amabel had been kneeling in an earnest
supplication that all might be forgiven that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had done amiss
in the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) childhood ; that the blessings might be sealed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband ; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) might go forth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
father's house in strength sent from above. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother sum-
moned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) rose, came calmly forth, met Guy at the head
of the stairs, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and they went down.

<p/>Charles was on the sofa in the ante-room, talking fast, and
striving for high spirits. ' Amy, woman, you do us credit ! Well,
write soon, and don't break your heart for want of me.''

<p/>There was a confusion of good-byes, and then all came out to



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 303

<p/>the hall door ; even Charles, with Charlotte's arm. One more
of those fast-locked embraces between the brother and sister,
and Mr. Edmonstone put Amabel into the carriage.

<p/>' Good-bye, good-ljye, my own dearest little one ! Bless you,
bless you ! and may you be as happy as a Mayflower ! Guy, good-
bye. I've given you the best I had to give, -- and `tis you that
are welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Take care what you do with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s
a precious little jewel ! Good-bye, my boy ! '

<p/>Guy's face and grasping hand were the reply. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
about to spring into the carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned again. ' Charlotte,
I have shut Bustle up in my room. Will you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) out in
half an hour ? I've explained it all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will be very
good. Good-bye.''

<p/>* I'll take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). I'll mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in every letter.''

<p/>' And, Markham, mind, if our house is not ready by Michael-
mas, we shall be obliged to come and stay with you.''

<p/>Grunt !

<p/>Lastly, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could not help it, Guy dashed up the step once
more, pressed Charles's hand, and said, ' God bless you, Charlie ! '

<p/>In an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was beside Amabel, and they drove off'', --
Amabel leaning forward, and gazing wistfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother and
Charles, till she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was startled by a long cluster of laburnums, their
yellow bloom bent down and heavy with wet, so that the ends
dashed against her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bonnet, and the crystal drops fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lap.

<p/>' Why, Amy, the Hollywell flowers are weeping for the loss
of you ! '

<p/>Hhe gave a sweet, sunny smile through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tears. At that
moment they came beyond the thick embowering shrubs, while
full before them was the dark receding cloud, on which the sun-
beams were painting a wide-spanned rainbow. The semicircle
was perfect, and full before them, like an arch of triumph under
which they were to pass.

<p/>' How beautiful ! ' broke from them both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bride</b></font>)</div>said the bride, after a few minutes had faded the
rainbow, and turned them from its sight, ' shall I tell you what
I was thinking ! I was thinking, that if there is a doom on us,
I am not afraid, if it will only bring a rainbow.''

<p/>' The rainbow will come after, if not with it,'' said Guy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s a winsome wee thing,

She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s a bonnie wee thing,
This sweet wee wifie of mine. -- Burns

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here. Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Burns</b></font>)</div>said Guy, pointing to a name in the
traveller's book at Altdorf.

<p/>' Captain Morville ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) exclaimed, ' July 14th. That was
only the day before yesterday.''



<p/>304 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' I wonder whether we shall overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ! Do you know
what was this gentleman's route ? ' inquired Guy, in French
that was daily becoming more producible.

<p/>The gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
knapsack, had not made much sensation. Tliere was a vague idea
that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had gone on to the St. Gothard ; but the guide who was
likely to know, was not forthcoming, and all Guy's inquiries
only resulted in, ' I dare say we shall hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) elsewhere.''

<p/>To tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed ; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could see, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said nothing, that Guy was not very
sorry. These two months had been so very happy, there had
been such full enjoyment, such freedom from care and vexation,
or aught that could for a moment ruffle the stream of delight.
Scenery, cathedrals, music, paintings, historical association, had
in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure ; and, above all,
Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
husband's mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts
inspired by the scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of
ideal hapj-RRB-iness, so exquisite, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could hardly believe it real.
A taste of society, which they had at Munich, though very
pleasant, had only made them more glad to be alone together
again ; any comj-RRB-anion would have been an interruption ; and
Philip, so intimate, yet with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) carping, persecuting spirit
towards Guy, was one of the last persons she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could wish to
meet ; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition
Guy wished to encourage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) peace.

<p/>For the loresent, no more was said about Philip ; and they
proceeded to Interlachen, where they spent a day or two, while
Arnaud was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) relations ; and they visited the two beautiful
lakes of Thun and Brientz. On first coming among mountains,
Amabel had been greatly afraid of the precipices, and had been
very much alarmed at the way in which Guy clambered about,
with a sureness of foot and steadiness of head acquired long ago
on the crags of RedclyfFe, and on which the guides were always
complimenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; but from seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) always come down
safe, and from having been enticed lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to several heights,
which had at first seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) most dizzy and dangerous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
had gradually laid aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) fears, and even become slightly,
very slightly, adventurous herself.

<p/>One beautiful evening, they were wandering on the side of the
Beatenberg, in the little narrow paths traced by the tread of
the goats and their herdsmen. Amabel sat down to try to sketcli
the outline of the white-capped Jung Frau and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) attendant
mountains, wishing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could draw as well as Laura, but intend-
ing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) outline to aid in describing the scene to those whose eyes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) longed to have with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). While she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was drawing, Guy began
to climb higher, and was soon out of sight, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) still heard
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whistling. The mountains were not easy to draw, or ratlier
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) grew discontented with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) black lines and white paper,
compared with the dazzling snow against the blue sky, tinged



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 305

<p/>by the roseate tints of the setting sun, and the dark fissures on
the rocky sides, still blacker from the contrast.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sketching materials, and began to gather some
of the delightful treasury of mountain flowers. A gentle slope
of grass was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and on it grew, at some little distance
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), a tuft of deep purple, the beautiful Alpine saxifrage,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) well knew by description. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went to gather it, but
the turf was slippery, and when once descending, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not
stop herself ; and what was the horror of finding herself half
slipping, half running down a slope, Avhicli became steeper every
moment, till it was suddenly broken off into a sheer precipice !
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) screamed, and grasped with both hands at some low bushes,
that grew under a rock at the side cf the treacherous turf. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
caught a branch, and found herself supported, by clinging to it
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hands, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) rested on the slope, now so nearly per-
pendicular, that to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hold would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) instantly down
the precipice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) whole weight seemed to depend on that
slender bough, and those little hands that clenched it convul-
sively, -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feet felt in vain for some hold. ``Guy ! Guy ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
shrieked again. Oh, where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whistle ceased, -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) called.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Oh, help me ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answered. But with that moment's joy
came the horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not help her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would only fall him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self. ' Take care ! don't come on the grass ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must
let go the branch in a short time, then a slip, the precipice, --
and what would become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? Those moments were hours.

<p/>' I am coming -- hold fast ! ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice above her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
very near. To find him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so close made the agony of dread and
of prayer even more intense. To be lost, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband
scarcely a stej-RRB- from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ! Yet how could he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stand on the
slippery turf, and so as to be steady enough to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) up ?

<p/>' Now, then ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, speaking from the rock under which
the brushwood grew, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot reach you unless you raise
up your hand to me -- your left hand -- straight up. Let go.
Now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a fearful moment. Amabel could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and
felt as if relinquishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) grasp of the tree was certain destruc-
tion. The instinct of self-preservation had been making her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
cling desperately with that left hand, especially as it held by the
thicker part of the bough. But the habit of implicit confidence
and obedience was stronger still ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not hesitate, and
tightening her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hold with the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) unclasped the
left and stretched it upwards.

<p/>Joy unspeakable to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fingers close over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) wrist, like
iron, even while the bush to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) had trusted was detach-
ing itself, almost uprooted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) weight ! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) had waited
a second she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) would have been lost, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) confidence had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) safety. A moment or two more, and with closed eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>)
was leaning against him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ; his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arm was round her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) guided

<p/>306 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) steps, till, breathless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) found herself on the broad, v/ell-
trodden path, out of sight of the precipice.

<p/>' Thank heaven ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, in a very low voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood
still. ' Thank God ! my Amy, I have you still.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up, and saw how pale he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was, though his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) voice had
been so steady throughout. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) leant on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) breast, and rested
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shoulder again in silence, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart was too
full of awe and thankfulness for words, even had she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) not been
without breath or jDOwer to speak, and needing his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) support in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) giddiness and trembling.

<p/>More than a minute jjassed thus. Then, beginning to recover,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) again, and said, ' Oh, it was dreadful ! I
did not think you could have saved me.''

<p/>' I thought so too for a moment ! ' said Guy, in a stifled voice.
' You are better now ? You are not hurt ? are you sure 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite sure ! I did not fall, you know, only slipped. No, I
have nothing the matter with me, thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) tried to stand alone, but the trembling returned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sit down, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) rested against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) still made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was unhurt. ' Yes, quite unhurt -- quite well ;
only this wrist is a little strained, and no wonder. Oh, I am
sure it was Providence that made those bushes grow just there ! '

<p/>' How did it happen ? '

<p/>' It was my fault. I went after a flower ; my foot slipped on
the turf, and I could not stop myself. I thought I should have
run right down the precij-RRB-ice.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes and shuddered again. ' It was frightful ! '
he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fast. ' It was a great mercy, indeed. Thank
heaven, it is over ! You are not giddy now.''

<p/>* Oh, no ; not at all ! '

<p/>' And your wrist ! '

<p/>' Oh, that's nothing. I only told you to show you what was
the worst,'' said Amy, smiling with recovered playfulness, the
most re-assuring of all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What flower was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' A piece of purple saxifrage. I thought there was no danger,
for it did not seem steep at first/

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No ; it was not your fault. You had better not move just
yet : sit still a little while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' O Guy, where are you going 1 '

<p/>' Only for your sketching tools and my stick. I shall not be
gone an instant. Sit still and recover.''

<p/>In a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) basket, and in it a
few of the flowers. ' Oh, I am sorry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, coming to meet
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; ' I wish I had told you I did not care for them. Why
did you ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not put myself in any peril about them. I had my
trusty staff'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>, you know.''

<p/>' I am glad I did not guess what you were doing. I thought
it so impossible, that I did not think of begging you not. I

<p/>shall keep them always. It is a good thing for us to be put in
mind how frail all our joy is,''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All?''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>asked Guy, scarcely as if replying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), while, though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) arm joressed hers, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eye was on the blue sky, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered
himself, <div class="bookquote">``Your joy no man taketh from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Amabel was much impressed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought what it would
have been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) if his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little wife had been snatched from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
so suddenly and frightfully. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) return -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
mother -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) desolate home and solitary life. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could almost
have wept for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Yet, at the moment of relief from the fear
of such misery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could thus speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could look onward to
the joy beyond, even while his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cheek was still blanched with the
horror and anguisli of the apprehension ; and how great they had
been was shown by the broken words he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) uttered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sleep, for
several nights afterwards, while by day he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was always watching
and cautioning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Assuredly his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dependence on tlie joy that
could not be lost did not make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doulDt his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tenderness ; it only
made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel how far behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, for would it have
been the same with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), had the danger been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) 1

<p/>In a couple of days they arrived at the beautiful Lugano, and,
as usual, their first walk was to the post-office, but disappoint-
ment awaited them. There had been some letters addressed to
the name of Morville, but the Signer Inglese had left orders
that such should be forwarded to Como, Amabel, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) best
Italian, strove hard to explain the difference between the captain
and Sir Guy, the Cavaliere Guide, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) translated him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), who
stood by looking much amused by the perplexities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lady's
construing ; while the post-master, though very polite and sorry
for the Signora's disappointment, stuck to the address being
Morville, jjoste 7^estante.

<p/>' There is one good thing,'' said the cavaliere, as they walked
away, ' we can find the captain now, I'll write and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)--
shall I say to meet us at Varenna or at Bellagio ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whichever suits him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best, I should tliink. It can't make
much difference to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Your voice has a disconsolate cadence,'' said Guy, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) witli a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered ; <div class="bookquote">``I have not a word to say

otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only it is the first drawback in our real day-dream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Just so, and that is all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' I am glad you feel the
same, not that I want you to change your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you remember our resolution against mere pleasure-

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You think we were ? '

<p/>' I was, at least ; for I know it was a satisfaction not to find
a letter, to say Redclyffe was ready for us.''

<p/>' I had rather it was Redclyffe than Philip.''

<p/>808 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' To be sure, I would not change my own dancing leaping waves
for this clear blue looking-glass of a lake, or even those white
peaks, I want you to make friends with those waves, Amy.
But it is a more real matter to make friends with Philip, the one
wish of my life. Not that I exactly expect to clear matters up,
but if some move is not made now, when it may, we shall stand
aloof for life, and there will be the feud where it was before/

<p/>' It is quite right,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' I dare say that, meeting so far
from home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will be glad to see us, and to hear the Holly well
news. I little thought last autumn where I should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>On the second evening from that time, Philip Morville was
walking, hot and dusty, between the high stone walls bordering
the road, and shutting out the beautiful view of the lake, at the
entrance of Bellagio, meditating on the note he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had received
from Guy, and intending to be magnanimous, and overlook former
offences for Amabel's sake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) considered
the marriage to have cleared off old scores, and that as long as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was happy, jjoor little thing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) husband should be borne
with, thougn not to the extent of the spoiling the Edmonstones
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>Thus reflecting, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entered the town, and walked on in search
of tlie hotel. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presently found himself on a terrace, looking
out on the deep blue lake, there divided by the promontory of
Bellagio, into two branches, the magnificent mountain forms
rising opjDOsite to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). A little boat was crossing, and as it
neared the landing-place, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw that it contained a gentleman
and lady, Englisli -- probably his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cousins themselves. They
looked up, and in another moment had waved their recognition.
Gestures and faces were strangely familiar, like a bit of Holly well
transplanted into that Italian scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hastened to the landing-
place, and was met by a hearty greeting from Guy, who seemed
full of eagerness to claim their closer relationship, and ready to
be congratulated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, Philip? I am glad we have caught you at
last. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liad wished to annoy Philip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could hardly have done-
so more effectually than by behaving as if nothing was amiss,
and disconcerting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) preparations for a reconciliation. But the
captain's ordinary manner was calculated to cover all sucli feel-
ings ; and as lie shook hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt much kindness for Amabel, .
as an unconscious victim, whose very smiles were melancholy,
and plenty of them there were, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rejoiced sincerely in the
meeting, as Guy was pleased, and a home face Avas a welcome
sight.

<p/>' I have your letters in my knapsack ; I will unpack them as
soon as we get to the hotel. I thought it safer not to send them
in search of you again, as we were to meet so soon.''

<p/>' Certainly. Are there many 1 '

<p/>' One for each of you, both from Holly well. I was very sorry



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 309

<p/>to have engrossed them ; but not knowing you were so near, I
only gave my surname.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was lucky for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, `otherwise we could not have
traced you. We saw your name at Altdorf, and have been trying
to come up witli you ever since.''

<p/>``I am glad we have met. What accounts have you from
homer

<p/>' Excellent,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' Charlie is uncommonly well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has
been out of doors a great deal, and has even dined out several
times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am very glad.''

<p/>' You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) has been improving ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) great illness.''

<p/>' You would be surprised to see how much better he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) moves,<div class="bookquote">''
said Guy ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) helps himself so much more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) foot to the ground ? '

<p/>' No,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' there is no hope of that ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is more
active, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) general health is improved ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) can sleep and
eat more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I always thought exertion would do more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) than any-
thing else.''

<p/>Amabel was vexed, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought exertion depended more on
health, than health on exertion ; besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought Philip
ought to take some blame to himself for the disaster on the
stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) made no answer, and Guy asked what Philij-RRB- had
been doing to-day.

<p/>' Walking over the hills from Como. Do you always travel
in this fashion, im2:-RRB-edimentis relictis ? '

<p/>' Not exactly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' the impedimenta are, some at
Varenna, some at the inn with Arnaud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)</div><p/>' So you have Arnaud with you % '

<p/>' Yes, and Anne Trower,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) maid was a Style-
hurst person, who had lived at Hollywell ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been
fit for service. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was greatly pleased to hear we were going
to meet the captain,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We amuse ourselves with thinking how she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) gets on with
Arnaud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. <div class="bookquote">``Their introduction took place only two
days before we were married, since which, they have had one
continued tete-d-tete, which must have been droll at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More so at last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``At first Anne thought Mr.
Arnaud so fine a gentleman, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hardly dared to speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>). I believe nothing awed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) so much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) extreme courtesy ;
but lately he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) has been quite fatherly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to dine
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) sister's chalet, where I would have given something to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to admire the country, but slie
does not like the snow, and misses our beautiful clover-fields
very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stylehurst</b></font>)</div><p/>' Stylehurst ought to have been better training for mountains,''
said Philip.

<p/>They were fast losing the stiffness of first meeting. Philip
could not but acknowledge to hiniself that Amy was looking



<p/>SIO THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>very well, and so happy that Guy must be fulfilling the condition
on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was to be borne with. However, these were early
days, and of course Guy must be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) at least in the
honeymoon, before the wear and tear of life began. They both
looked so young, that having advised them to wait four years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was ready to charge them with youthf ulness, if not as a fault, at
least as a folly ; indeed, the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own aftairs made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
inclined to think it a foible, almost a want of patience, in any one
to marry before thirty. It was a conflict of feeling. Guy was
so cordial and good-humoured, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not help being,
almost gained ; but, on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had always thought
Guy's manners eminently agreeable ; and as happiness always
made jDeople good-humoured, this was no reason for relying on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Besides, the present ease and oiDenness of manner might
only result from security.

<p/>Other circumstances combined, more than the captain imagined,
in what is popularly called putting him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) out. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had always
been hitherto on equal terms witli Guy ; indeed, had rather the
superiority at Hollywell, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) age and assumption of character,
but here Sir Guy was somebody, the captain nobody, and even
the advantage of age was lost, now that Guy was married and
head of a family, while Philip was a stray young man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
guest. Far above such considerations as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought himself, and
deeming them only the tokens of the mammon worship of the time,
Philip, nevertheless, did not like to be secondary to one to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had always been preferred ; and this, and perhaps the being
half ashamed of it, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) something more approaching to
cross than ever before ; but now and then, the persevering
amiability of both would soften him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) most
gracious mood.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gave them their letters when they reached the inn, feeling
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a better right than they, to one which was in Laura's
writing, and when left in solitary possession of the sitting-room
-- a very pleasant one, with Avindows opening on the terrace
just above the water -- j^^^ed up and down, dialing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own
perplexity of feeling.

<p/>Presently they came back ; Guy sat down to continue their
joint journal-like letter to Charles, while Amabel made an orderly
arrangement of their properties, making the most of their few
books, and taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) work as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had been at home.
Philip looked at the books.

<p/>' Have you a Childe Harold hero ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Harold</b></font>). ' I want to look
ut something in it.''

<p/>' No, we have not.''

<p/>' Guy, you never forget poetry ; I dare say you can help me
out with those stanzas about the mists in the valley.''

<p/>' I have never read it,'' said Guy. ' Don't you remember
warning me against Byron 1 '

<p/>' You did not think that was for life ! Besides,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) continued,
feeling this reply inconsistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) contempt for Guy's youth,

<p/>`that applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perversions of human passions, not to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
descriptions of scenery/

<p/>' I tJiink,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, looking up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) letter, ' I should be
more unwilling to take a man like that to interpret nature than
anything else, except Scripture. It is more i-RRB-rofane to attempt it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I see what you mean,'' said Amabel, thoughtfully.

<p/>' More than I do,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' I never supposed you would
take my advice au pied de la lettre^ he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had almost added,
' perversely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I have felt my obligations for that caution ever since I have
come to some knowledge of what Byron was,'' said Guy.

<p/>' The fascination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Giaour heroes has an evil influence on
some minds,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip. ' I think you do well to avoid it. The
half truth, resulting from its being the effect of self -contempla-
tion, makes it more dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Giaour heroes</b></font>)</div><p/>' True,'' said Guy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lit^ole knew how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) owed to
having attended to that caution ; for who could have told where
the mastery might have been in the period of fearful conflict with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) passions, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) imagination with the con-
templation of revenge, dark hatred, and malice, and identifying
himself with Byron's brooding and lowering heroes 1

<p/>' But,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Philip, ' I cannot see why you should shun
the fine descriptions which are almost classical -- the Bridge of
Sighs, the Gladiator.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) may describe the gladiator as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pleases,'' said
Guy ; ' indeed there is something noble in that indignant line --

<p/>Butchered to make a Roman liolidaj' ;

<p/>but that is not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meddling with these mountains or the sea.''

<p/>' Fine description is the point in both. You are over-drawing.''

<p/>' My notion is this,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, -- ' there is danger in listening
to a man who is sure to misunderstand the voice of nature, --
danger, lest by filling our ears with the wrong voice we should
close them to the true one. I should think there was a great
chance of being led to stop short at the material beauty, or worse,
to link human passions with the glories of nature, and so distort,
defile, profane them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' You have never read the poem, so you cannot judge,'' said
Philii^, thinking this extremely fanciful and ultra-fastidious.
' Your rule would exclude all descriptive poetry, unless it was
written by angels, I suppose 1 '

<p/>' No ; by men with minds in the right direction.''

<p/>' Very little you would leave us.''

<p/>' I don't think so,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel. ' Almost all the poetry we
really care about was written by such men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Shakspeare, for instance 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No one can doubt of the bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) mind from the whole
strain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) writings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. ' So again with Spenser ; and
as to Milton, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) religion was not quite the right sort, no
one can pretend to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had it not. Wordsworth, Scott^ -'



<p/>312 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' Scott r said Philip.

<p/>' Including the descriptions of scenery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) novels,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy,
' where, I am sure, there is the spirit and the beauty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Or rather, the spirit is the beauty,'' said Guy.

<p/>' There is a good deal in what you say,<div class="bookquote">'' answered Philip, who
would not lay himself open to the accusation of being uncandid,
`but you will forgive me for thinking it rather too deep an
explanation of the grounds of not making Childe Harold a
hand-book for Italy, like other people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div><p/>Amabel thought this so dogged and provoking, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was
out of patience ; but Guy only laughed, and said, ' Rather so,
considering that the fact was that we never thought of it.''

<p/>There were times when, as Philip had once said, good temper
annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) more than anything, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was uncon-
sciously disappointed at having lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old power of fretting and
irritating Guy, and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) champ the bit, so as to justify
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Every proceeding of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousins seemed
to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) annoyance, more especially their being at home to-
gether, and Guy's seeming to belong more to Hollywell than
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sat by, with a book, and watched them, as Guy
asked for Laura's letter, and Amy came to look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) half-
finished answer, laughing over it, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) commands and
messages, looking so full of playfulness and happiness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
stood with one hand on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's chair, and tlie
other holding the letter, and Guy watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) amused race, and
answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) remarks with lively words and bright smiles.
' People who looked no deeper than the surface would say, what
a well-matched pair,<div class="bookquote">'' thought Philip ; ' and no doubt they were
very happy, poor young things, if it would but last.''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>Here Guy
turned, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a question about the line of perpetual
snow, so much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own style, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was almost ready to accuse
tliem of laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Next came what hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) most of
all, as they talked over Charles's letter, and a few words passed
about Laura, and the admiration of some person she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had met at
Allonby. The whole world was welcome to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) : nothing
could injure his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart ; and no joke of Charles could
shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) confidence : but it was hard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should be forced
to hear such things, and ask no questions, for they evidently
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) occujDied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) book, and did not intend him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to
listen. The next thing they said, however, obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to show
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was attending, for it was about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) being better.

<p/>' Who % Laura ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, in a tone that, in spite of himself,
had a startled sound. ' You did not say she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had been ill % '

<p/>' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has not,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy. ' Dr. Mayerne said tliere was
nothing really the matter ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has been worried and out of
spirits lately ; and mamma thought it would be good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to
go out more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip would not let himself sigh, in spite of tlie oppressing
consciousness of having brought the cloud over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
own inability to do aught but leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to endure it in silence



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 313

<p/>and patience. Alas ! for how long ? Obliged, meanwliile, to see
these young creatures, placed, by the mere factitious circum-
stance of wealth, in possession of happiness which they had not
had time either to earn or to appreciate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought it shallow,
because of their mirth and gaiety, as if they were only seeking
food for laughter, finding it in mistakes, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was ready
to despise them.

<p/>Arnaud had brought rather antiquated notions to the renewal
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) office as a courier : his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) mind had hardly opened to railroads
and steamers, and changes had come over hotels since his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) time.
Guy and Amabel, both young and healthy, caring little about
bad dinners, and unwilling to tease the old man by complaints,
or alterations of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrangements, had troubled themselves little
about the matter ; took things as they found them, ate dry bread
when the cookery was bad, walked if the road was ' sliocking ' ;
went away the sooner, if the inns were ' intolerable' ; made merry
over every inconvenience, and turned it into an excellent story
for Charles. They did not even distress themselves about sights
which they had missed seeing.

<p/>Philip thought all this very foolish and absurd, showing that
they were unlit to take care of themselves, and that Guy was
neglectful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife's comforts : in short, establishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
original opinion of their youth and folly.

<p/>So j-RRB-assed the first evening ; perhaps the worst because, besides
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had heard about Laura, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been somewhat over-
fatigued by various hot days' walks.

<p/>Certain it is, that next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Avas not nearly so much
inclined to be displeased with them for laughing, when, in speak-
ing to Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) inadvertently called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mistress Miss Amabel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, as Anne departed -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked
disconcerted, as a precise man always does when catching himself
in a mistake -- ' Anne is used to it ; Guy is always doing it, and
puzzles poor Arnaud sorely by sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) for Miss Amabel's
parasol.''

<p/>' And the other day,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, ' when Thorndale's brother, at
Munich, inquired after Lady Morville, I had to consider who
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh ! you saw Thorndale's brother, did you ? '

<p/>' Yes ; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was very obliging. Guy had to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) about
our passports : and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found who we were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
wife to call on us, and asked us to an evening party.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guy thought we must, and it was very entertaining. W©
liad a curious adventure there. In the morning, we had been
looking at those beautiful windows of the great church, when I
turned round, and saw a gentleman -- an Englishman -- gazing
with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) might at Guy. We met again in the evening, and
presently Mr. Thorndale came and told us it was Mr. Shene.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>' Shene, the painter ? '

<p/>' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had been very much struck with Guy's face : it



<p/>314 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wanted for a picture he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was about, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
wished of all things just to be allowed to make a sketch.''

<p/>' Did you submit 1 '

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' and we Avere rewarded. I never saw a more
agreealble person, or one who gave so entirely the impression of
genius. The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) took us through the gallery, and
showed us all that was worth admiring.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``And in what character is he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to make you appear ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the strange part of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said Amabel. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
remember how Gluy once puzzled us by choosing Sir Galahad for
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) favourite hero ? It is that very Sir Galahad, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) kneels
to adore the Saint Greal,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shene</b></font>)</div><p/>' Mr. Shene said he (<font color='blue'><b>Shene</b></font>) had long been dreaming over it, and at
last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shene</b></font>) saw Guy's face looking upwards, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that it
was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wanted : it would be worth anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
to catch the expression.''

<p/>``I wonder what I was looking like ! ' ejaculated Guy.

<p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) take you as yourself, or as Sir Galahad ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As myself, happily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) succeed ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy likes it ; but decidedly I should never have known myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife --

<p/>' Could some fay the giftie gie us,
To see ourselves as others see us.''

<p/>' As far as the sun-burnt visage is concerned, the glass does
that every morning.''

<p/>' Yes ; but you don't look at yourself exactly as you do at a
painted window,'' said Amy, in lier demure way.

<p/>' I cannot think how you found time for sitting,'' said Pliilip.

<p/>' G, it is quite a little thing, a mere sketch, done in two
evenings and half an hour in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) promises it to
me when he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) has done with Sir Gahxliad,'' said Amy.

<p/>' Two -- three evenings. You must have been a long time at
Munich.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fortnight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy ; `there is a great deal to see there.''

<p/>Pliihp did not quite understand this, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think it very
satisfactory that they should thus have lingered in a gay town,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) meant to make the best of them to-day, and returned to
liis usual fashion of patronizing and laying down the law. They
were so used to this that they did not care about it ; indeed,
they had reckoned on it as the most amiable conduct to be
expected on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) part.

<p/>The day was chiefly spent in an excursion on the lake, landing
at the most beautiful spots, walking a little way and admiring,
or while in the boat, smootlily moving over the deep blue waters,
gaining lovely views of the banks, and talking over the book
with which their acquaintance had begun, / Promessi Sposi.
Never did tourists spend a more serene and pleasant day.

<p/>On comparing notes as to their plans, it appeared that eacli
party had about a week or ten days to spare ; tlie captain before



<p/>THE HETR OF REDCLYFFE 315

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) must embai-k for Corfu, and Sir Guy and Lady Morville
before the time tliey had fixed for returning liome. Guy pro-
posed to go together somewhere, spare the post-olfice further
blunders, and get the Signer Capitano to be their interpreter.
Philip thought it would be an excellent thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) young
cousins for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to take charge of them, and show them how
people ought to travel ; so out came his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) little pocket map, marked
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) route, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) left Ireland, whereas they seemed to
have no fixed object, but to be always going <div class="bookquote">``somewhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It
appeared that they had thought of Venice, but were easily
diverted from it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) design of coasting the eastern bank of
the Lago di Como, and so across the Stelvio into the Tyrol, all
together as far as Botzen, whence PhilijD would turn southward
by the mountain paths, while they would proceed to Innspruck
on their return home.

<p/>Amabel was especially pleased to stay a little longer on the
banks of the lake, and to trace out more of Lucia's liaunts ; and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) secretly thought it would have been jDleasanter without a
third person, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was gratified to see how nmch Guy's manner
liad softened Philip's injustice and distrust, making everything
so smooth and satisfactory, that at the end of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought liis experiment had not failed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was making the breakfast the next morning, wlien the
captain came into the room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) Guy was gone to
settle their plans Avith Arnaud. After lingering a little by the
window, Philip turned, and with more abruptness than was usual
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), said --

<p/>' You don't think there is any cause of anxiety about Laura 1 '

<p/>' No ; certainly not ! ' said Amy, surprised. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has not been
looking well lately, but Dr. -RSB-\Iayerne says it is nothing, and you
know' -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) blushed and looked down -- `there were many things
to make this a trying time.''

<p/>' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) quite strong 1 Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) do as much as usvial ? '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does more than ever : mamma is only afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) over-
working herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never allows that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is tired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) goes
to school three days in the week, besides walking to East-hill on
Thursday, to help in the singing ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is getting dreadfully
learned. Guy gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) old mathematical books, and Charlie
always calls her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) Miss Parabola.''

<p/>Philip was silent, knowing too well why slie sought to stifle
care in employment ; and feeling embittered against tlie whole
world, against her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father, against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own circumstances, against
the happiness of otliers ; nay, perhaps, against the Providence
which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was.

<p/>Presently Guy came in, and the first thing lie said was, ' I am
afraid we must give up our plan.''

<p/>' How ? ' exclaimed both Philip and Amy.

<p/>* I haA'e just heard that there is a fever at Sondrio, and all that
neiglibourhood, and every one says it would be very foolish to
expose ourselves to it.''



<p/>316 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* What shall we do instead ? ' said Amy.

<p/>' I told Arnaud we would let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) know in an hour's time ; I
thought of Venice.''

<p/>' Venice, oli, yes, delightful.''

<p/>' What do you say, Phili-RSB-3 ? ' said Guy.

<p/>' I say that I cannot see any occasion for our being frightened
out of our original determination. If a fever prevails among
the half-starved peasantry, it need not affect well-fed healthy
persons, merely passing through the country.''

<p/>' You see we could hardly manage without sleeping there,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Guy : ' we must sleep either at Colico, or at Madonna. Now
Colico, they say, is a most unhealthy place at this time of year,
and Madonna is the very heart of the fever -- Sondrio not much
better. I don't see how it is to be safely done ; and though very
likely we might not catch the fever, I don't see any use in trying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a slave</b></font>)</div><p/>' That is making yourself a slave to the fear of infection.''

<p/>' I don't know what purpose would be answered by running
the risk,'' said Guy.

<p/>' If you chose to give it so dignified a name as a risk,'' said Philip.

<p/>' I don't, then,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, smiling. ' I should not care if there
was any reason for going there ; but, as there is not, I shall face-
Mr. Edmonstone better if I don't run Amy into any more chances,
of mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Is Amy grateful for the care,'' said Philip, ' after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wishes,
for the eastern bank ? '

<p/>' Amy is a good wife,'' said Guy. ' For Venice, then. I'll ring
for Arnaud. You will come with vis, won't you, Philip 1 '

<p/>' No, I thank you ; I always intended to see the Valtelline,,
and an epidemic among the peasantry does not seem to me to be
sufficient to deter.''

<p/>' O Philip, you surely will not ? ' said Amy.

<p/>' My mind is made up. Amy, thank you.''

<p/>' I wish you would be persuaded,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' I should like
particularly to have you to lionize us there ; and I don't fancy
your running into danger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The argument lasted long. Philip by no means approved of
Venice, especially after the long loitering at Munich, thinking
that in both places there was danger of Guy's being led into
mischief l-RRB-y his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) musical connections. Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) best,
for Amabel's sake, to turn them from their purpose, persuaded
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own mind that the fever was a mere bugbear, raised up
by Arnaud ; and, perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) full health and strength,
almost regarding illness itself as a foible, far more the dread of
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) argued, therefore, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) most provoking strain, becoming
more vexatious as the former annoyance was revived at finding
the impossibility of making Guy swerve from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) purpose, while
additional mists of suspicion arose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), making him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ima-
gine that tlie whole objection was caused by Guy's dislike to
submit to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and a fit of impatience of which Amy was the
victim ; nay, that his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) cousin wanted to escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) surveil-



<p/>THE HEm OF REDCLYFFE Ml

<p/>lance, ancl follow tlie bent of his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) inclinations ; and the whole heap
of prejudices and half -refuted accusations resumed their full
ascendancy. Never had his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) manner been more vexatious, though
without departing from the coolness which always characterized
it ; iDut all the time, Guy, while firm and unmoved in purpose,
kept liis temper perfectly, and apparently without effort. Even
Amabel glowed with indignation, at the assumption with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was striving to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband down, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) rejoiced to
see its entire failure : for some sensible argument, or some gay,
lively, good-humoured reply, was the utmost he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could elicit.
Guy did not seem to be in the least irritated or ruffled by the
very behaviour which used to cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so many struggles.
Having once seriously said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not think it right to run
into danger, withottv adequate cause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) position with so
much ease, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could afford to be playful, and laugh at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
own dread of infection, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) changeableness, and credulity. Never
had temper been more entirely subdued ; for surely if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
bear this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) need never fear himself again.

<p/>So passed the hour ; and Amabel was heartily glad when the
debate was closed by Arnaud's coming for orders. Guy went
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; Amabel began to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) goods ; and Philip, after
a few moments' reflection, spoke in the half-compassionate, half-
patronizing manner with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) used, now and then, to let fall
a few crumbs of counsel or commendation for silly little Amy.

<p/>' Well, Amy, you yielded very amiably, and that is the only
way. You will always find it best to submit.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) got no further in his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) intended warning against the dissipa-
tions of Venice, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) at first with a look
of extreme wonder. Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face assumed an expression of
dignity, and gently, but gravely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, ' I think you forget to
whom you are speaking.''

<p/>The gentlemanlike instinct made him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) reply, ' I beg your par-
don'-- and there he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) stopped, as much taken by surprise as if a dove
had flown in his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) actually was confused ; for in very
truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had, after a fashion, forgotten that slie was Lady Mor-
ville, not the cousin Amy with whom Guy's character might be
freely discussed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had often presumed as far with his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) aunt ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), though always turning the conversation, had never given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) a rebuff Amabel had not done ; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) soft voice, firmly,
though not angrily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) spoke on. ' One thing I wish to say,
because we shall never speak on this subject again, and I was
always afraid of you before. You have always misunderstood
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; I might almost say, chosen to misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). _ You
liave tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) temper more than any one, and never appreciated
the struggles that have subdued it. It is not because I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
wife that I say this-- indeed I am not sure it becomes me to say
it ; yet I cannot bear that you should not be told of it, because
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) acts out of enmity to you. You little know how
your friendship has been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first desire-- how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has striven for
it-- liow, after all you have done and written, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) defended you



<p/>318 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) might when those at home were angry-- how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
sought you out on purpose to try to be real cordial friends.''

<p/>Philip's face had grown rigid, and chiefly at the words, ' those
at home were angry.'' ' It is not I that prevent that friendship,
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) : ' it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own want of openness. J\Iy opinion has never

<p/>' No ; i know it has never changed,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, in a tone of
sorrowful displeasure. ' Whenever it does, you will be sorry you
have judged liim so harshly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left the room, and Philip held her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in higher esteem. _ He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
saw there was spirit and substance beneath that soft girlish
exterior, and hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would better be able to endure the
troubles which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) precipitate marriage was likely to cause her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ;
but as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) combined fickleness and obstinacy had
only become more apparent than ever-- fickleness in forsaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) purpose, obstinacy in adherence to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own will. ^

<p/>Displeased and contemptuous, Philip was not softened by Guy s
freedom and openness of manner and desire to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as far as
their roads lay together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was gracious only to Lady Mor-
ville, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) treated with kindness, intended to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) for a reproof Avhich became her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) position
well, though it could not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) thought this
amiability especially insufferable : forwhenshe arrived at Varenna
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chief thought was that here they should be free of him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>).

<p/>' Come, Philip,'' said Guy, at that last moment, ' I wish you
would tliink better of it after all, and come with us to Milan.

<p/>' Thank you, my mind is made up.''

<p/>' Well, mind you don't catch the fever : for I don t want the
trouble of nursing you.''




<p/>said

<p/>' Good-bye, then,<div class="bookquote">''' said Guy. Then remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) promise
to Laura, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, ' I wish we could have seen more of you
They will be glad to hear of you at Hollywell. You have had
one warm friend there all along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was touched for a moment by this kind speech, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
tone was less grave and dignified. ' Remember me to them when
you write,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered, ' and tell Laura she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must not wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)-
self out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) studies. Good-bye, Amy ; I hope you will have
a pleasant journey.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>The farewells were exchanged and the carriage drove oil.
' Poor little Amy ! ' said Philip to himself, ' how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is improved.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has a sweet little wife in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). The fates have conspired to
crown him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with all man can desire, and little marvel if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
abuse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advantages. Poor little Amy ! I have less hope than
ever, since even her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) evident wishes could not bend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) determina-
tion in this trifle ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is a good little creature, happy m Jier
blindness. May it long continue ! It is my uncle and aunt who
are to be blamed.'' i n i

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) set himself to ascend the mountain path, and they looked

<p/>back, watching the firm vigorous steps with which lie climbed
the hill side, then stood to wave his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hand to Amabel, looking a
perfect specimen of health and activity.

<p/>' Just like himself,'' said Amy, drawing so long a breath that
Guy smiled, but did not speak.

<p/>' Are you much vexed ? ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>' I don't feel as if I had made the most of my opportunities.''

<p/>' Then if you have not, I can tell you who lias. What do you
think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beginning to give me a lecture how to behave to you V

<p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) think you wanted it very much ? '

<p/>* I don't know : for of course I could not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) go on.''

<p/>Guy was so much diverted at the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wanting a lecture
on wife-like deportment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had no time to be angry at the
impertinence, and lie made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laugh also by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) view that it
was all force of habit.

<p/>' Now, Guido -- good Cavaliere Guido -- do grant me one satis-
faction,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), coaxingly. ' Only say you are very glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Guido</b></font>)
is gone his (<font color='blue'><b>Guido</b></font>) own way.''

<p/>' I don't want you to be glad of that, I only want you to be
glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is not sitting here towering over us.''

<p/>Guy smiled, and began to whistle --

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXI

<p/>And turned the thistles of a curse
To types beneficent. -- Wordsworth

<p/>It was about three weeks after the rendezvous at Bellagio, that
Sir Guy and Lady Morville arrived at Vicenza, on their way
from Venice. They were in the midst of breakfast when Arnaud
entered, saying, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was well. Sir Guy, that you changed your intention of
visiting the Valtelline with Captain Mor%dlle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)</div><p/>' What ! Have you heard anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) temerity has caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to suffer. I have just
heard that an Englishman of your name is severely ill at Recoara.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At la badia di Recoara. It is what in English we call a
watering-place, on the mountains to the north, where the
Vicentini do go in summer for fraicheiii\ but they have all
returned in the last two days for fear of the infection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I'll go and make inquiries,'' said Guy, rising in haste. Return-
ing in a quarter of an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, -- ' It is true. It can be no
other than poor Philip. I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) doctor, an Italian, who,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw our name written, said it was the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) calls
it iDiafehhre molto grave!



<p/>320 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Very heavy ! Did lie only know the name in writing 1 '

<p/>' Only from seeing it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) passport. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been unable to
give any directions.''

<p/>' How dreadfully ill he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must be ! And alone ! What shal?
we do ? You won't think of leaving me behind you, whatever
you do ? ' exclaimed Amabel, imploringly.

<p/>' It is at no great distance, and -'

<p/>' O, don't say that. Only take me with you. I will try to bear
it, if you don't think it right ; but it will be very hard ! '

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) struggled to repress them,
and was silent in suspense as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) considering.

<p/>' My poor Amy ! ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), presently ; ' I believe the anxiety
would be worse for you if I were to leave you here.''

<p/>* Oh, thank you ! ' exclaimed she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>' You will have nothing to do with the nursing. No, I don't
think there is much risk ; so we will go together.''

<p/>' Thank you ! thank you ! and perhaps I may be of some use.
But is it very infectious 1 '

<p/>' I hope not : caught at Colico, and imported to a fresh place,
I should think there was little fear of its spreading. However,
we must soon be off; I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) is very ill, and almost
deserted. In the first place, I had better send an express to the
Consul at Venice, to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Consul</b></font>) to recommend us a doctor, for
I have not much faith in this Italian.''

<p/>They were soon on the way to Recoara, a road bordered on one
side by high rocks, on the other by a little river flowing down
a valley, shut in by mountains. The valley gradually contracted
in the ascent, till it became a ravine, and further on a mere
crevice, marked by the thick growth of the chestnut-trees ; but
before this greater narrowing, they saw the roofs of the houses
in the little town. The sun shone clear, the air had grown fresh
as they mounted higher ; Amabel could hardly imagine sickness
and sorrow in so fair a spot, and turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) husband to say
so ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was deep in thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>The town was built on the bank of the stream, and very much
shut in by the steep crags, which seemed almost to overhang the
inn, to which they drove, auguring favourably of the place from
its fresh, clean aspect.

<p/>Guy hastened to the patient ; while Amabel was conducted to
a room with a polished floor, and very little furniture, and there
waited anxiously until he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) returned. There was a flush on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
face, and almost before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) leant far out of the window
to try to catch a breath of air.

<p/>' We must find another room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) directly,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
cannot possibly exist where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is -- a little den-- -such an atmo-
sphere of fever -- enough to knock one down ! Will you have one
got ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Directly,'' said Amabel, ringing. ' How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is in a stupor : it is not sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is frightfully ilL
I never felt anything like the heat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) skin. But that stifling



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 321

<p/>hole would account for much ; very likely lie may revive, when
we get him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) into a better atmosphere. No one has attended to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) properly. It is a terrible thing to be ill in a foreign country
without a friend ! '

<p/>Arnaud came, and Amabel sent for the hostess, while Guy re-
turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) charge. Little care had been taken for the solitary
traveller on foot, too ill to exact attention, and whose presence
drove away custom ; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) case was taken up by a Milord
Inglese, the people of the inn were ready to do their utmost to
cause their neglect to be forgotten, and everything was at the
disposal of the Signora. The rooms were many, but very small,
and the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could contrive was to choose three rooms on the
lower floor, rather larger than the rest, and opening into each
other, as well as into the passage, so that it was possible to pro-
duce a thorough draught. Under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) superintendence,'' Anne
made the apartment look comfortable, and almost English, and
sending word that all was ready, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) proceeded to establish
herself in the corresponding rooms on the floor above.

<p/>Philip was perfectly unconscious when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was carried to liis
new room. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) illness had continued about a week, and . had
been aggravated first by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) incredulous and determined resistance
of it, and then by tl>e neglect with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been treated.
It was fearful to see how his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) great strength had been cut down,
as there he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay with scarcely a sign of life, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gasping,
labouring breath. Guy stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), let the air blow in from
the open window, sprinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face with vinegar, and moistened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips, longing for the physician, for whom, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must wait many hours. Perplexed, ignorant of the proper
treatment, fearing to do harm, and extremely anxious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) still
was almost rejoiced : for there was no one to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so
glad to do a service, and a hope arose of full reconciliation.

<p/>The patient was somewhat revived by the fresh air ; he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
breathed more freely, moved, and made a murmuring sound, as
if striving painfully for a word.

<p/>' Da here^ at last he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said ; and if Guy had not known its
meaning, it would have been plain from the gasping, parched
manner in which it was uttered.

<p/>' Some water ? ' said Guy, holding it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips, and on hearing
the English, Philip opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) drank, gazed with
a heavy sort of wonder. ' Is that enough ? Do you like some
on your forehead % '

<p/>' Thank you.''

<p/>' Is that more comfortable ? We only heard to-day you were ill.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turned away restlessly, as if hardly glad to see Guy, and
not awake to the circumstances, in a dull, feverish oppression of
the senses. Delirium soon came on, or, more properly, delusion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was distressed by thinking himself deserted, and struggling
to speak Italian, and when Guy replied in English, though the
native tongue seemed to fall kindly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ear, yet, to Guy's great
grief, the old dislike appeared to prevent all comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)

<p/>Y



<p/>322 THE HEIR OF REDCLYEFE

<p/>presence, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not repel his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attentions. At night
the wandering increased, till it became unintelligible raving,
and strength was required to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in bed.

<p/>Amabel seldom saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband this evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) once came
up to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) drink some coffee, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
soon went, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should sit up, and begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to go
to rest quietly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked pale and tired. The night was a
terrible one, and morning only brought insensibility. The phy-
sician arrived, a Lnarp-looking Frenchman, who pronounced it
to be a very severe and dangerous case, more violent than usual
in malaria fever, and with more affection of the brain. Guy was
glad to be set to do something, instead of standing by in inac-
tion ; but ice and blisters were applied without effect, and they
were told that it was likely to be long before the fever abated.

<p/>Day after day passed without improvement, and with few
gleams of consciousness, and even these were not free from
wandering ; they were only intervals in the violent ravings, or
the incoherent murmurs, and were never clear from some tortur-
ing fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was alone and ill at Broadstone, and neither
the Edmonstones nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brother-officers would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), or
else that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was detained from Stylehurst. ' Home ' was the word
oftenest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips. ' I would not go home,'' the only expression
that could sometimes be distinctly heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was obliged to
depend on Guy as the only Englishman at hand ; but whenever
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), the traces of repugnance were evident, and in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) clearer intervals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) always showed a preference for Arnaud's
attendance. Still Guy persevered indefatigably, sitting up with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) every night, and showing himself an invaluable nurse, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tender hand, modulated voice, quick eye, and quiet activity.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whole soul was engrossed : he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never appeared to think of
himself, or to be sensible of fatigue ; but was only absorbed in
the one thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) patient's comfort ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seldom came to
Amabel except at meals, and now and then for a short visit to
her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sitting-room to report on Philip's condition. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
spare a little more time when Philip was in a state of stupor,
she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) used to try to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to take some rest ; and if it
was late, or in the heat of noon, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could sometimes get him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
as a favour to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), to lie down on the sofa, and let lier read to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; but it did not often end in sleep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) usually preferred
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) out into the fresh air, and wandering about among
the chesstnut-trees and green hillocks liigher up in the ravine.

<p/>Very precious were these walks, with the quiet grave talk that
the scene and the circumstances inspired -- when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would tell
the thoughts that had occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) night-watches, and
they shared the subdued and deep reflection suited to this period
of apprehension. These were her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) happiest times, but they were
few and uncertain. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had in the meantime to wait, to watch,
and hope alone, though she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had plenty of employment ; for
besides writing constant bulletins, all preparations for the sick-
room fell to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) share. She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had to send for or devise substitutes



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 323

<p/>for all the conveniences tliat were far from coming readily to
hand in a remote Italian inn-- to give orders, send commissions
to Vicenza, or even to Venice, and to do a good deal, with Anne's
assistance, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own manual labour. Guy said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did more
for Philip outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) room than he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did inside, and often declared
how entirely at a loss he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should have been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not been
there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ready resources, and, above all, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sweet
presence, making the short intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spent out of the sick
chamber so much more than repose, such refreshment at the
time, and in remembrance.

<p/>Thus it had continued for more than a fortnight, when one
evening as the French physician was departing, he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) told Guy that
he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) would not fail to come the next night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) saw every reason
to expect a crisis. Guy sat intently marking every alteration in
the worn, flushed, suffering face that rested helplessly on the
pillows, and every unconscious movement of the wasted, nerveless
limbs stretched out in pain and helplessness, contrasting his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pre-
sent state with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was when last they parted, in the full
pride of health, vigour, and intellect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dwelt on all that had
passed between them from the first, the strange ancestral enmity
that nothing had as yet overcome, the misunderstandings, the
prejudices, the character whose faultlessness he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had always
revered, and the repeated failure of all attempts to be friends, as
if his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own impatience and passion had borne fruit in the merited
distrust of the man whom of all others he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) respected, and whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would fain love as a brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) earnestly hoped that so
valuable a life might be spared ; but if that might not be, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
fervent wish was, that at least a few parting words of good-
will and reconciliation might be granted to be his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) comfort in
remembrance.

<p/>So mused Guy during the night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) watched the heavy
doze between sleep and stupor, and tried to catch the low, indis-
tinct mutterings that now and then seemed to ask for some-
thing. Towards morning Philip awoke more fully, and as Guy
was feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) faintly asked,--

<p/>I How many 1 ' while his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes had more of their usual expression.
I cannot count,'' returned Guy ; ' but it is less than in the
evening. Some drink ? '

<p/>Philip took some, then making an effort to look round, said,--
' What day is it T ' '

<p/>' Saturday morning, the 23rd of August.''

<p/>' I have been ill a long time ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have indeed, full three weeks ; but you are better to-night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was silent for some moments ; then, collecting himself,
and looking fixedly at Guy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own steady voice'
though very feeble,--' I suppose, humanly speaking, it is an even
chance between life and death ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, firmly, the low sweet tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voice full
ot tenderness. ' You are very ill, but not without hope.<div class="bookquote">'' Then
after a pause, during which Philip looked thouglitful, but calm,''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Y 2

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added, -- ' I have tried to bring a clergyman here, but I could
not succeed. Would you like me to read to you ? '

<p/>' Thank you -- presently -- but I have something to say. Some

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't think of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, with a rush of joy at hearing
the words of reconciliation he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had yearned for so long.

<p/>' And now you have been most kind. If I live, you shall see
that I am sensible of it ; ' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feebly moved liis hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
cousin, who pressed it, hardly ^ less happy than on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
stood before Mrs. Edmonstone in the dressing-room. Presently,
Philip went on. ' My sister has my will. My love to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and
to -- to -- to poor Laura.<div class="bookquote">'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice suddenly failed ; and while
Guy was again moistening his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gathered strength, and
said, -- ' You and Amy will do what you can for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Do not
let the blow come suddenly. Ah ! you do not know. We liave
been engaged this long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy did not exclaim, but Philip saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) amazement.

<p/>' It was very wrong ; it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fault,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added. ' I can't
tell you now ; but if I live all sliall be told. If not, you will be
kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Indeed we will.''

<p/>' Poor Laura ! ' again said Philip, in a much weaker voice, and
after lying still a little longer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) faintly whispered, -- <div class="bookquote">``Read
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Guy read till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fell into a doze, which lasted till Arnaud came
in the morning, and Guy went up to liis wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), entering with a quiet bright look, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has
spoken to me according to my wish.''

<p/>' Tlien it is all right,'' said Amabel, answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) look with
one as calm and sweet. ' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) better ? '

<p/>' Not materially ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse is still very high ; but tliere was a
gleam of perfect consciousness ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke calmly and clearly,
fully understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) situation. Come Avhat will, it is a thing
to be infinitely thankful for ! I am very glad ! Now for our
morning reading.''

<p/>As soon as it was over, and when Guy had satisfied himself
that the patient was still quiet, they sat down to breakfast. Guy
considered a little while, and said, --

<p/>' I have been very much surprised. Had you any idea of an
attachment between him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and Laura ? '

<p/>' I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has always been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
favourite. What 1 Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) been in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) all this time,
poor fellow ? '

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) says they are engaged.''

<p/>' Laura ? Our sister ! Oh, Guy, impossible ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must have
been wandering.''

<p/>' I could have almost thought so ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whole manner for-
bade me to think there was any delusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was too weak to
explain ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) fault, and was overcome



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 325

<p/>when speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) begged us to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) from sud-
denly hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was as cahn and reasonable as
I am at this moment. No, Amy, it was not delirium.''

<p/>' I don't know how to believe it ! ' said Amabel. ' It is so im-
possible for Laura, and for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) too. Don't you know how, some-
times in fevers, people take a delusion, and are quite rational
about everything else, and that, too ; if only it was true ; and
don't you think it very likely, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) really has been in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) all this time, -LRB-how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must have gone through !-RRB-
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) may fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has been secretly engaged, and reproach himself?''

<p/>' I cannot tell,'' said Guy ; ' there was a reality in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) manner
of speaking that refuses to let me disbelieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Surely it
cannot be one of the horrors of death that we should be left to
reiDroach ourselves with the fancied sins we have been prone to,
as well as with our real ones. Then ' -- and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rose, and walked
about the room -- ' if so, more than ever, in the hour of death,
good Lord, deliver us ! '

<p/>Amabel was silent, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sat down, saying,--' Well,
time will show ! '

<p/>' I cannot think it ! ' said Amy. ' Laura ! How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
help telling mamma 1 ' And as Guy smiled at the recollection
of their own simultaneous coming to mamma, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) added, -- ' Not
only because it was right, but for tlie comfort of it.''

<p/>' But, Amy, do you remember what I told you of poor Laura's
fears, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said to me, on our wedding-day ? '

<p/>' Poor Laura ! ' said Amy. ' Yet ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) paused, and Guy

<p/>presently said, --

<p/>' Well, I won't believe it, if I can possibly help it. I can't
afford to lose my faith in my sister's perfection, or Philip's, espe-
cially now. But I must go ; I have loitered too long, and Arnaud
ought to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) breakfast.''

<p/>Amabel sat long over the remains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) breakfast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did
not puzzle herself over Philijo's confession, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would not
admit it without confirmation ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could not think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
misdoings, even those of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was certain, on the day when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) life was hanging in the balance. All she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could bear to recol-
lect was his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) excellence ; nay, in tlie tenderness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
nearly made out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had always been very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>),
overlooking that even before Guy came to Hollywell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had
always regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with more awe than liking, been disinclined
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good advice, shrunk from liis condescension, and regularly
enjoyed Charles's quizzing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). All this, and all the subse-
quent injuries were forgotten, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) believed, as sincerely as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband, that Philip had Ijeen free from any unkind intention.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) chiefly dwelt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own Guy, especially that last
speech, so unlike some of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had heard, who were rather
glad to find a flaw in a faultless model, if only to obtain a fellow-
feeling for it.

<p/>' Yes,'' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), ' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might look far without finding any-
thing better than himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won't believe it. If e^^er



<p/>326 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could make me angry, it will be by treating me as if I was
better than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Such nonsense ! But I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) goodness
would not be such if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was conscious of it, so I must be content
witli him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is. I can't be so unwifelike after all ; for I am
sure nothing makes me feel so small and foolish as that humility
of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ! Come, I must see about some dinner for the French
doctor.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) set to work on her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) housewifery cares ; but when these
were despatched, it was liard to begin anything else on such a
day of suspense, when she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was living on reports from the sick
room. The delirium had returned, more violent than ever ; and
as she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) open window she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) often heard the disconnected
words. She (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could do nothing but listen -- she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could neither read
nor draw, and even letter-writing failed her (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to-day, for it seemed
cruel to send a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sister, and if Philip was not under a
delusion, it was still worse to write to Holly^vell ; it made lier
shudder to think of the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) might have inflicted in the
former letters, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) had not spared the detail of her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) worst
fears and conjectures, and by no means softenec'' the account, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) had done to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Late in the afternoon the physician came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) lieard of
liis being quieter ; indeed, there were no sounds below. It grew
dark ; Arnaud brouglit lights, and told lier Captain Morville had
sunk into stuj^or. After another long space, the doctor came to
take some coffee, and said the fever was lessening, but that
strength was going with it, and if le malade was saved, it would
be owing to the care and attention of le chevalier.

<p/>Of Guy she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) saw no more that evening. The last bulletin was
pencilled by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) on a strip of paper, and sent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) at eleven
at night :

<p/>' Pulse almost nothing ; deadly faintness ; doctor does not give
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) up ; it may be many hours : don't sit up ; you shall hear
when there is anything decisive.''

<p/>Amy submitted, and slowly put herself to bed, because slie
thought Guy would not like to And lier up ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had little
sleep, and that was dreamy, full of the same anxieties as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
waking moments, and perhaps making the night seem longer
than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been awake the whole time.

<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) started from a somewhat sounder doze than usual,
and saw it was becoming light ; the white summits of the moun-
tains were beginning to show themselves, and there was twilight
in the room. Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard a light, cautious tread in the
passage ; the lock of Guy's dressing-room was gently, slowly
turned. It was over then ! Life or death ? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart beat as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lieard her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband s step in the next room, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) suspense
would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) call out nothing but -- ' I am not asleep ! '

<p/>Guy came forward, and stood still, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up to the
outline of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) figure against the window. With a kind of effort
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, with forced calmness -- ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)'ll do now ! ' and came to the
bedside. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face was wet with tears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes were over-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 327

<p/>flowing. After a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) murmured a few low words of
deep thanksgivings, and again there was a silence.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is asleep quietly and comfortably,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, presently,
' and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse is steadier. The faintness and sinking have been
dreadful ; the doctor has been sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pulse,
telling me when to put the cordial into liis mouth. Twice I
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) all but gone ; and till within tlie last hour, I did
not think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could liave revived ; but now, the doctor says we
may almost consider tlie danger as over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oil, how glad I am ! Was he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sensible ? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) speak 1 '

<p/>' Sensible at least when not fainting ; but too weak to speak,
or often to look up. When he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did though, it was very kindly, very
pleasantly. And now ! This is joy coming in the morning, Amy ! '

<p/>' I wonder if you are happier now than after the shipwreck,''
said Amy, after a silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you ask? The shipwreck was a gleam, the first
ray that came to cheer me in those penance hours, when I was
cut off from all ; and now, oh. Amy ! I cannot enter into it.
Such richness and fulness of blessing showered on me, more
than I ever dared to wish for or dream of, both in the present
and future hopes. It seems more than can belong to man, at
least to me, so unlike what I have deserved, that I can hardly
believe it. It must be sent as a great trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div><p/>Amabel thought this so beautiful, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could not answer ;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) presently gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) some further particulars. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went
back in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) entreaties that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would afford himself a
little rest, saying that the doctor was obliged to go away, and
Philip still needed the most careful watching. Amy could not
sleep any more ; but lay musing over that ever-brightening good-
ness which had lately at all times almost startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) from its
very unearthliness.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXII

<p/>Sure all things wear a heavenly dress,

<p/>Which sanctilies their loveliness,

<p/>Types of that endless resting day,

<p/>When we shall be as changed as they. -- Hvmn for Sunday

<p/>From that time there was little more cause for anxiety. Philip
was, indeed, exceedingly reduced, unable to turn in bed, to lift
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head, or to speak except now and then a feeble Avhisper ; but
the fever was entirely gone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) excellent constitution began
rapidly to repair its ravages. Day by day, almost hour by hour,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was rallying, spending most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) time profitably in sleep,
and looking very contented in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) short intervals of waking.
These became each day rather longer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice became stronger,
and lie made more remarks and inquiries. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) first care, when
able to take heed of what did not concern his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) immediate com-
fort, was that Colonel Deane should be written to, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) leave of
absence was expired ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said not a word about Hollywell,



<p/>328 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>and Amabel therefore hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) surmise was right, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) con-
fession had been prompted by a delirious fancy, tliough Guy
thouglit something was implied by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) silence respecting the very
persons of whom it would have been natural to have talked.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was very patient of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) weakness and dependence, always
thankful and willing to be pleased, and all that had been un-
pleasant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) manner to Guy was entirely gone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liked to
be waited on by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and received his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) attentions without laborious
gratitude, just in the way partly affectionate, partly matter of
course, that was most agreeable ; showing himself considerate of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fatigue, though without any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) old domineering advice.

<p/>One evening, Guy was writing, wlien Philip, who had been
lying still, as if asleep, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Are you writing to Hollywell?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, to Charlotte ; but there is no hurry, it won't go till to-
morrow. Have you any message 1 '

<p/>' No, thank you.''

<p/>Guy fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sighed ; and there was a long silence, at the end
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) asked, ' Guy, have I said anything about Laura ? '

<p/>' Yes,'' said Guy, putting down the pen.

<p/>' I thought so ; but I could not remember,'' said Philip, turning
round, and settling himself for conversation, witli much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
ordinary deliberate preparation ; ' I hope it was not when I had
no command of myself 1 '

<p/>' No, you were seldom intelligible ; you were generally trying
to speak Italian, or else talking about Stylehurst. The only
time you mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was the niglit before the worst.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recollect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``I will not draw back from the
resolution I then made, though I did not know whether I had
sj^oken it, let tlie consequences be what they may. The worst
is, that they will fall the most severely on her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) : and her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) implicit
reliance on me was her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) only error.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice was ^^ery low, and so full of painful feeling that Guy
doubted whether to let liim enter on such a subject at present ;
but remembering the relief of free confession, lie thought it best
to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to proceed, only now and then putting in some note
of sympathy or of interrogation, in Avord or gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, `that you may see liow little
blame can be imputed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). It was that summer, three years
ago, the first after you came. I had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) chief
friend. I saw, or thought I saw, cause for putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
guard. The result has shown that the danger was imaginary ;
but no matter-- I thought it real. In the course of the con-
versation, more of my true sentiments were avowed than I was
aware of ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was very young, and before we, either of us, knew
what we were doing, it liad been equivalent to a declaration.
Well ! I do not speak to excuse the concealment, but to show
you my motive. If it had been known, there would have been
great displeasure and disturbance ; I should have been banished ;
and though time might have softened matters, we should both
liave had a great deal to go through. Heaven knows what it



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 329'

<p/>may be now ! And, Guy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added, breaking off with trembling
eagerness, ' when did you hear from Holly well 1 Do you know
liow slie has borne the news of my illness ? '

<p/>' We liave heard since they knew of it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' the letter was
from Mrs. Edmonstone to Amy ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not mention Laura.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>SSlie has great strengtli ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would endure anything rather
than give way ; but how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) have borne the anxiety and
silence ? You are sure my aunt does not mention her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Certain. I will ask Amy for the letter, if you like.''

<p/>* No, do not go ; I must finish, since I have begun. We did
not speak of an engagement ; it was little more than an avowal
of preference ; I doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) understood what it amounted
to, and I desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to be silent. I deceived myself all along,
by declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was free ; and I had never asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
promise ; but tl^ose things will not do when we see death face
to face, and a resolve made at such a moment must be kept, let
it bring what it may.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``True.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will be relieved ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wished it to be known ; but I thought
it best to wait for my promotion -- the only chance of our being
able to marry. However, it shall be put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father's hands
as soon as I can hold a pen. All I wish is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should not
have to bear the brunt of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) anger.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is too kind and good-natured to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) displeasure long.''

<p/>' If it would only light on the right head, instead of on the
head of the nearest. You say she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was harassed and out of spirits.
I wish you were at home ; Amy would comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and soften
them.''

<p/>' We hope to go back as soon as you are in travelling condi-
tion. If you will come liome with us, you will be at hand when
Mr. Edmonstone is ready to forgive, as I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) soon will
be. No one ever Avas so glad to forget liis displeasure.''

<p/>' Yes ; it will be o\ev by the time I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will
have borne it all. There is the worst ! But I will not put
off the writing, as soon as I have the power. Every day the
concealment continues is a further offence.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And present suffering is an especial earnest and hope of for-
giveness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy. ' I liave no doubt that much may be done
to make Mr. Edmonstone tliink well of it.''

<p/>' If any sufi'ering of mine would spare hers ! ' sighed Philip.
' You cannot estimate the difficulties in our way. You know
nothing of poverty, -- the bar it is to everything ; almost a posi-
tive offence in itself ! '

<p/>' This is only tiring yourself with talking,'' said Guy, perceiv-
ing how Philip's bodily weakness was making him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fall into a
desponding strain. <div class="bookquote">``You must make liaste to get well, and
come home with us, and I think we shall find it no such bad
case after all. There's Amy's fortune to begin with, only wait-
ing for such an occasion. No ; I can't have you answer ; you
have talked quite long enough.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>330 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Philip was in a state of feebleness that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) willing to
avoid the trouble of thinking, by simply believing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
told, `that it was no bad case.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was relieved by having
confessed, though to tlie person whom, a few weeks back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
would have thought the last to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could have made such
a communication, over whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had striven to assume superi-
ority, and therefore before whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could have least borne to
humble himself -- nay, whose own love he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had lately traversed
with an arrogance that was rendered positively absurd by this
conduct of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not shrunk from the
confession. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been real repentance, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) perceived
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) faults ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would have scorned to avail himself of the
certainty of Guy's silence on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had said at tlie time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
extreme danger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had resolved to speak, and had found
neither an accuser nor a judge, not even one consciously returning
good for evil, but a friend with honest, simple, straightforward
kindness, doing the best for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) power, and dreading
nothing so much as hurting his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feelings. It was not the way
in which Pliilip himself could have received such a confidence.

<p/>As soon as Guy could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife. ' Amy,<div class="bookquote">''
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), rather sadly, `we have had it out. It is too true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) first exclamation surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) : ' Then Charlie really is
the cleverest person in the world.''

<p/>' How 1 Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) any suspicion 1 '

<p/>' Not that I know of ; but, more than once, lately, I have
been alarmed by recollecting how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) once said tliat poor Laura
was so much too wise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) age, that Nature would some day
take her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) revenge, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) do something very foolish. But
has Philip told you all about it?''

<p/>' Yes ; explained it all very kindly. It must have cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a
great deal ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke openly and nobly. It is the beginning
of a full confession to your father.''

<p/>' So, it is true ! ' exclaimed Amabel, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) heard it for the
first time. ' How shocked mamma will be ! I don't know how
to think it possible ! And poor Laura ! Imagine what she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
must have gone through ; for you know I never spared the worst
accounts. Do tell me all.''

<p/>Guy told what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had just heard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was indignant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't be as angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) as I should like,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said slie, `now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is sorry and ill ; but it was a great deal too bad ! I
can't think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could look any of us in the face, far less
expect to rule us all, and interfere with you ! '

<p/>' I see I never appreciated the temptations of poverty,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Guy, thoughtfully. ' I have often thought of those of wealth,
but never of poverty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``I wish you would not excuse him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>). I don't mind your doing
it about ourselves, because, though he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) made you unliappy, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
could not make you do wrong. Ah ! I know what you mean ;
but that was over after the first minute ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) only made you
better for all his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) persecution ; but I don't know liow to pardon

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) making poor Laura so miserable, and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to do what
was not right. Poor, dear girl ! no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked so worn
and unhapity ! I cannot help being angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), indeed,
Guy ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes full of tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The best pleading is his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own repentance, Amy. I don't

to-morrow, now the doctor says all fear of infection is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I shall be thinking of poor Laura the whole time.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) present state?

<p/>' I shall wait till you send me. Besides, how can you invite

or any of the Round Table 1 Come, I wish you would lie down,
and be read to sleep.''

<p/>' I should like a walk much better. It is very cool and bright.
Will you come 1 '

<p/>They walked for some time, talking over the conduct of Philip
and Laura. Amabel seemed quite oppressed by the thought of
such a burthen of concealment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not know what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) should have done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own troubles without mamma and
Charlie ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not imagine Laura's keeping silence
through the time of Philip's danger ; more especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
recollected how appalling some of lier bulletins had been. The
only satisfaction was in casting as much of the blame on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as
possible.

<p/>' You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) never would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) read novels ; and I do be-
lieve that was the reason she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not understand what it meant.''

<p/>' I think there is a good deal in that,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, laughing,
' though Charlie would say it is a very novel excuse for a young
lady falling imprudently in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I do believe, if it was any one but Laura, Charlie would be
very glad of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) always fully saw through Philip's super-
cilious shell.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No ; let me go on, Guy, for you must allow that it was much
worse in such a grave, grand, unromantic person, who makes a
point of thinking before he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) speaks, than if it had been a hasty,
hand-over-head man like Maurice de Courcy, who might have
got into a scrape without knowing it.''



<p/>332 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' That must have made the struggle to confess all the more
painful ; and a most free, noble, open-hearted confession it was,''

<p/>They tried to recollect all that had passed during that summed',
and to guess against Avhom he (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) had wished to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ; but so
far were they from divining the truth, that they agreed it must
either have been Maurice, or some other wild Irishman,

<p/>Next, they considered what was to be done. Philip must
manage his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confession his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own way ; but they had it in their
IDOwer greatly to soften matters ; and there was no fear that,
after the first shock, Mr„ Edmonstone would insist on tlie
engagement being broken off, Philip should come to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
health at Redclyffe, Avliere he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be ready to meet tlie first
advance towards forgiveness, -- and Amabel thought it would
soon be made. Papa's anger was sharp, but soon over ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) was
very fond of Philip, and delighted in a love affair ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was
afraid mamma would not get over it so soon, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would be
excessively hurt and grieved, <div class="bookquote">``And when I was naughty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, ' nothing ever made me so sorry as mamma's kindness.''

<p/>Guy launched out into more schemes for facilitating their
marriage than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had made for himself ; and tlie walk ended
with extensive castle building on Philip's account, in the course
of which Amy was obliged to become much less displeased. Guy
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), in the evening, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would have been still more
softened if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could have heard liim talk about Stylehurst and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father. Guy had always wished to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) speak of the
Archdeacon, though they had never been on terms to enter on
such a subject. And now Philip had been much pleased by Guy's
account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) walks to Stylehurst, and taken pleasure in telling
which were his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old haunts, making out where Guy had been, and
describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father's ways.

<p/>The next day Avas Sunday, and Amabel was to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cousin
a visit. Guy was very eager about it, saying it was like a stage
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) recovery ; and though the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother and
Laura could not be laid aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would not say a w^ord to damp
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband's pleasure in the anticij-RRB-ation. It seemed as if Guy,
wanting to bestow all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could upon liis cousin in gratitude for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) newly-accorded friendship, thought the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little wife
the very best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had to give.

<p/>It was a beautiful day, early in September, with a little
autumnal freshness in the mountain breezes that they enjoyed
exceedingly. Pliilip's convalescence, and their own escape, miglit
be considered as so far decided that they might look back on the
peril as i^ast. Amabel felt how much cause there was for thank-
fulness ; and, after all, Philip was not half as bad now as when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was maintaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) system of concealment ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) liad made a
great effort, and was about to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) best by way of reparation ;
but it was so new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not know how
to begin.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) tried to make the day seem as Sunday-like as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could,
by putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) white muslin dress and white ribbons, with



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 333

<p/>Cliarles's hair bracelet, and a brooch of beautiful silver workman-
ship, which Guy liad bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) at Milan, the only ornament
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had ever given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) window, watching the
groups of Italians in their holiday costume, and dwelling on the
strange thoughts that had passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mind often before
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lonely Sundays in tliis foreign land, thinking much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
old home and East-hill Church, wondering whether the letter
liad yet arrived which was to free them from anxiety, and losing
herself in a maze of uncomfortable marvels about Laura.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>at length said Guy, entering, <div class="bookquote">``I only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
has not knocked himself up with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) 23reparations, for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would
make such a setting to rights, that I told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) I could almost
fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) expected the queen instead of only Dame Amabel
Morville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) down, opened the door, and playfully announced,
' Lady Morville ! I have done it right this time. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is ! '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had of course expected to see Philip much altered, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) Avas startled by the extent of the change ; for being naturally
fair and high-coloured, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was a person on whom the traces of
illness were particularly visible. The colour was totally gone,
even from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lips ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cheeks were sunken, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) brow looked
broader and more massive from the thinness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face and the
loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes themselves appeared unlike what
they used to be in the hollows round them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seemed tranquil,
and comfortable, but so wan, weak, and subdued, and so different
from himself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was very much shocked ; as smiling and
holding out a hand, where the white skin seemed hardly to cover
the bone and blue vein, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, in a tone, slow, feeble, and languid,
though cheerful, --

<p/>' Good morning, Amy. You see Guy was right, after all. I
am sorry to have made your wedding tour end so unpleasantly.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, most pleasantly, since you are better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said Amabel,
laughing, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was almost ready to cry, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) dis-
pleasure went straight out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) head.

<p/>' Are you doing the honours of my room, Guy 1 ' said Philip,
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head from the pillow, with a becoming shade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
ceremonious courtesy. ' Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) a chair.''

<p/>Amy smiled and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as a
sick person is apt to do at a flower, or the first pretty enlivening
object from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is able to derive enjoyment; and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
could not help expressing the feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said --
' ' Is that your wedding-dress. Amy ? '

<p/>' Oh, no ; that was all lace and finery.''

<p/>' You look so nice and bridal '

<p/>' There's a compliment that such an old wife ought to make
the most of. Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) with a certain proud
satisfaction in Philip's admiration. ' It is Jiigh time to leave off
calling you a bride, after your splendid appearance at the party
at Munich, in all your wliiteness and orange-flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' That was quite enough of it,'' said Amy, smiling.



<p/>334 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' Not at all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip ; ' you have all your troubles in the
visiting line to come, when you go home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! you know the people, and will be a great help to us,''
said Amy, and Guy was much pleased to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) taking a volun-
tary share in the invitation, knowing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) only half
liked it.

<p/>' Thank you ; we shall see,'' replied Philip.

<p/>' Yes ; we shall see when you are lit for the journey, and it
will not be long before we can begin, by short stages. You have
got on wonderfully in the last few days. How do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
is looking, Amy 1 ' hnished Guy, with an air of triumph, that was
rather amusing, considering what a pale skeleton face he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
regarding with so much satisfaction.

<p/>' I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is looking much mended,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' but you
must not expect me to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't get a compliment for me, Guy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, <div class="bookquote">``I
was a good deal surprised when Arnaud brought me the glass
this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is a pity you did not see yourself a week ago,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy,
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head drolly. ' It is certain, as the French doctor
says, that monsieur has a very vigorous constitution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Charles says, having a good constitution is only another
name for undergoing every possible malady,'' said Amy.

<p/>' Rather good,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy ; ' for I certainly find it answer very
well to have none at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Haven't you 1 ' said Amy, rather startled.

<p/>' Or how do ycu know ? ' said Philip ; ' especially as you never
were ill.''

<p/>' It is a dictum of old Walters, the Moorworth doctor, the last
time I had anything to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>), when I was a small child.
I sup-RSB-30se I remembered it for its oracular sound, and because I
was not intended to listen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) was talking over with Markham
some illness I had just got through, and wound up with, <div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>)
may be healthy and active now ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) has no constitution,
there is a tendency to low fever, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) meets with any severe
illness, it will go hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>' How glad I am I did not know that before,'' cried Amy.

<p/>' Did you remember it when you came here ? ' said Philip.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy, not in the least conscious of the impression his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
words made on the others. ' By the bye, Philip, I wish you would
tell us how you fared after we parted, and how you came here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I went on according to my former plan,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, ' walking
through the Valtelline, and coming down by a mountain path.
I was not well at Bolzano, but I thought it only fatigue, whicli a
Sunday's rest would remove, so on I went for the next two days,
in spite of pain in head and limbs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not walking 1 ' said Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, walking. I thought it was stiffness from mountain
climbing, and that I could walk it off; but I never wisli to go
through anything like what I did the last day, between the up



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 335

<p/>and downs of that mountain path, and the dazzle of the snow
and heat of the sun. I meant to have reached Vicenza, but I
must have been quite knocked up when I arrived here, though I
cannot tell. My head grew so confused, that my dread, all the
way, was that I should forget my Italian ; I can just remember
conning a phrase over and over again, lest I should lose it. I
suppose I was able to speak when I came here ; but the last
thing I remember was feeling very ill in some room, different
from this, quite alone, and with a horror of dying deserted. The
next is a confused recollection of the relief of hearing English
again, and seeing my excellent nurse here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little more talk, but a little was enough for Philip's
feeble voice, and Guy soon told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was tired, and ordered in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) broth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) begged that Amy would stay, and it was per-
mitted on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not talk, Guy even cutting
short a quotation of, -- ' As Juno had been sick and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dieter,''
-- appropriate to the excellence of the broths, which Amabel and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) maid, thanks to their experience of Charles's fastidious tastes,
managed to devise and execute, in spite of bad materials. It was
no small merit in Guy to stop the compliment, considering how
edified he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wife's unexpected ingenuity, and what
a comical account he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had written of it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother, such, as
Amy told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), deserved to be published in a book of good advice
to young ladies, to show what they might come to if they behaved
well. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was glad to have ocular demonstration of
the success of the cookery, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had feared might turn
out uneatable ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gentle feelings towards Philip were
touched, by seeing one wont to be full of independence and self-
assertion, now meek and helpless, requiring to be lifted, and
propped up ^vith pillows, and depending entirely and thankfully
upon Guy.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been settled and made comfortable, they read
the service ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's tones had never been
so sweet as now, modulated to the pitch best suited to the sick-
room, and with the peculiarly beautiful expression he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) always gave
such reading. It was the lesson from Jeremiah, on the different
destiny of Josiah and his (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) sons, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) read that verse, ' Weep
ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>), but weep sore for him (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>)
that goeth away ; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) shall return no more, nor see his (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) native
country ; ' with so remarkable a melancholy and beauty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>)
voice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Josiah</b></font>) could hardly refrain from tears, and it also
greatly struck Philip, who had been so near ' returning no more,
neither seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) native country.''

<p/>When the reading was over, and they were leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to rest,
while they went to dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished Amy good-bye,
' Till now I never discovered the practical advantage of such a
voice as Guy's. There never was such a one for a sick-room.
Last week, I could not bear any one else to speak at all ; and
even now, no one else could have read so that I could like it.''

<p/>' Your voice ; yes,'' said Amy, after they had returned to their



<p/>336 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>own sitting-room, <div class="bookquote">``I want to hear it very much. I wonder
when you will sing to me again/

<p/>' Not till he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has recovered strength to bear the infliction with
firmness/ said Guy ; ' but, Amy, I'll tell you what we will do, if
you are sure it is good for you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) will have a good long sleep,
and we will have a walk on the green hillocks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Accordingly they wandered in the cool of the evening on the
grassy slopes under the chestnut-trees, making it a Sunday walk,
calm, bright and meditative, without many words, but those
deep and grave, ' such as their walks had been before they were
married,'' as Amabel said.

<p/>' Better,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) answered.

<p/>A silence, broken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) asking, ``Do you recollect your
melancholy definition of liapjDiness, years ago ? '

<p/>``What was it r

<p/>``Gleams from another world, too soon eclipsed or forfeited.
It made me sad then. Do you hold to it now 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I want to know what you would say now ? '

<p/>' Gleams from another world, brightening as it gets nearer.''

<p/>Amabel repeated --

<p/>Ever the richest, tenderest glow.

<p/>Sets round the autumnal sun ;
But their sight fails, no heart niaj' know

<p/>The bliss when life is done.

<p/>' Old age,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) added ; ' that seems very far off'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.'

<p/>' Each day is a step,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) answered, and then came a silence
while both were thinking deeply.

<p/>They sat down to rest under a tree, the mountains before
them with heavy dark clouds hanging on their sides, and the
white crowns clear against the blue sky, a perfect stillness on all
around, and the red glow of an Italian sunset just fading away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is only one thing wanting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``You may
sing now. You are far from Philip's hearing. SujDpose we
chant this afternoon's jDsalms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the fifth day of the month, and the psalms seemed
especially suitable to their thoughts. Before the 29tli was
finished, it was beginning to grow dark. There were a few pale
flashes of lightning in the mountains, and at the words <div class="bookquote">``Tlie
voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a low but solemn peal
of thunder came as an accompaniment.

marvellous whiteness on the snowy crowns, casting fantastic
shadows from the crags, Avhile whole showers of fire-flies were
falling on them from the trees, floating and glancing in the shade.
' It is a pity to go in,'' said Amy. But Arnaud did not seem
to -RSB--RRB-e of the same opinion : he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) came out to meet them very
anxiously, expostulating on the dangers of the autumnal dew ;
and Guy owned that though it had been the most wonderful and
delightful evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had ever known, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was rather fatigued.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIII

<p/>From darkness here and dreariness,

<p/>We ask not full repose. -- Christian Year

<p/>It seemed as if the fatigue which Guy had undergone was
going to make itself felt at last, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had a slight headache
the next morning, and seemed dull and weary. Both he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and
Amabel sat for some time with Philip, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) went away
to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) letters, Philip began discussing a plan which had
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of offering himself as chief of the constabulary
force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. It was an
oflice which would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very well, and opened a new hope
of liis marriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) proceeded to reckon on Lord Tliorndale's
interest, counting up all the magistrates he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knew, and talking
them over with Guy, who, however, did not know enough of
liis own neighbourhood to be of much use ; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came
up-stairs a little after, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was vexed at having been so
stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had seemed unkind and indifferent.
But the truth was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so heavy and drowsy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
had actually fallen twice into a doze while Philip was talking.

<p/>' Of course,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' gentle sleep will take her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) revenge at
last for your calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a popular delusion. Lie down, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own way, and you will be good for something by and by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) advice, slept for a couple of hours, and awoke a
good deal refreshed, so that though his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head still ached, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was
able to attend as usual to Philip in the evening.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not waken the next morning till so late, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sprung
up in consternation, and began to dress in haste to go to Philip ;
but presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) dressing-room with a hasty
uncertain step, and threw himself down on the bed. Amabel
came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) side in an instant, much frightened at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) paleness,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke directly. ' Only a fit of giddiness-- it is going off* ; '
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) raised himself, but was obliged to lie down again directly.

<p/>' You had better keep quiet,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). ' Is it your headache ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is aching,''  (<font color='red'><b>Guy/Sir Guy</b></font>)</div>said Guy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand over it.

<p/>' How hot and throbbing ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). ' You must have caught
cold in that walk. No, don't try to move ; it is only making it
worse.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go to Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) answered, starting up; but this

<p/>brought on such a sensation of dizziness and faintness, that lie
sunk back on the pillow.

<p/>' No ; it is of no use to fight against it,'' said Amy, as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was a little better. <div class="bookquote">``Never mind Philip, I'll go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).
You must keeiD quiet, and I will get you a cup of hot tea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lay still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had the comfort of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) somewhat
revived • but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) persuasions not to attempt to
move. It was later than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had expected, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) found that
breakfast was laid out in the next room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) some
tea ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not seem inclined to lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) head to drink it ;
and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to go at once to Philii^, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must be
thinking himself strangely forgotten, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) many
directions about the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liked to be waited on at breakfast.

<p/>Very much surprised was Philip to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) instead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
husband, and greatly concerned to hear that Guy was not well.

<p/>' Over-fatigue,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not but feel the effects of
such long-continued exertion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, after an interval, during
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had begun breakfast, with many ajDologies for letting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, with some breaks, ' Never was there
such a nurse as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Amy ; I have felt much more than I can
express, especially now. You will never have to complain of
my harsh judgment again ! '

<p/>' It is too much for you to talk of these things,'' said Amabel,
moved by the trembling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feeble voice, but too anxious to
return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband to like to wait even to hear that Philip's
opinion hadalteved. It required much self-command not to hurry,
even by manner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cousin's tardy, languid movements ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
had been well trained by Charles in waiting on sick breakfasts.

<p/>When at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was able to escape, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) found that Guy
had undressed, and gone to bed again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was more
comfortable, and desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to go and take her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own breakfast
before coming back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) obeyed as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could,
but very soon was again with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked flushed and
oppressed, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cool hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) forehead,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was frightened at the increased throbbing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) temples.

<p/>' Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), looking steadily at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), ' this is the fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Without answering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand into hers, and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
pulse, which did indeed plainly respond fever. Each knew that
the other was recollecting what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had said, on fSunday, of the
doctor's prediction, and Amy knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was thinking of death ;
but all that passed was a proposal to send at once for the French
physician. Amabel wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) note with steadiness, derived from
the very force of the shock. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could not think ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not
know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) feared or hoped. To act from one moment to
another was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) attemjDted, and it was well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) imagina-
tion did not open to be appalled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own situation -- so young,
alone with the charge of two sick men in a foreign country ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
cousin, indeed, recovering, but helpless, and not even in a state
to afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) counsel ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband sickening for this frightful
fever, and with more than ordinary cause for apprehension, even



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 339

<p/>without the doctor's prophecy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) slight
frame, and excitable temperament, and that though never as yet
tried by a day's illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) certainly had more spirit than strength,
while all the fatigue he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been undergoing was likely to tell
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not look forward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not look
round ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not hope or fear ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) trusted, and did her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) best
for each, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was wanted, trying not to make herself useless
to both, by showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wished to be in two places at once.

<p/>It was a day sufficiently distressing in itself had there been no
further apprehension, for there was the restlessness of illness,
working on a character too active and energetic to acquiesce
without a trial in the certainty that there was no remedy for
present discomfort. There was no impatience nor rebellion
against the illness itself, but a wish to try one after another
the things that had been effective in relieving Philip during his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
recovery. At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear that Amabel
should do anything to tire herself, and was very anxious that
Philip should not be neglected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tossed from one side to the
other in burning oppression or cold chills ; Amy saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looking
Avistful, suggested something by way of alleviation, then found
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been wishing for it, but refraining from asking in order
to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) procured it. Again
and again this happened ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) smoothed the coverings, and shook
up the pillow : he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) anxiously, beg
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) not to exert herself, but soon grew restless, and the whole
was repeated.

<p/>At last, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was trying to arrange the coverings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
exclaimed,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see how it is. Thjs is impatience. Now, I will not stir
for an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made the resolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) smiled at treating
himself so like a child. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) power of self-restraint came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
aid, and long before the hour was over he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had fallen asleep.

<p/>This was a relief ; yet that oppressed, flushed, discomposed
slumber, and heavy breathings, only confirmed lier fears that the
fever had gained full possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liad not the heart
to write such tidings, at least till the physician should have made
them too certain, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) even bear to use the word ' feverish,''
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) answers to the anxious inquiries Philip made wlienever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) room, tliough when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face with
a heavy sigh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) conclusion was the same as her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own.

<p/>The opinion of the physician was the only thing wanting to
bring home the certainty, and that fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) like lead in the
evening ; with one comfort, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) thouglit it a less
severe case than the former one. It was a great relief, too, that
there was no wandering of mind, only the extreme drowsiness
and oppression ; and when Guy was roused by the doctor's visit,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was as clear and collected as possible, making inquiries and
remarks, and speaking in a particularly calm and quiet manner.
As soon as the doctor was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked up to Amabel, saying,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) own smile, only very dim, --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be of no use, and it would not be true, to say I
liad rather you did not nurse me. The doctor hopes there is not
much danger of infection, and it is too late for precautions,''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am very glad,'' said Amy,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must be wise, and not hurt yourself. Will you

<p/>' It is very kind of you to tell me nothing worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
with a sad submissiveness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) smiled again. ' I am very sorry for you,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, looking
very tenderly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). ' To have us both on your hands at once !
But it comes straight from Heaven, tliat is one comfort, and you
made up your mind to such things when you took me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Sadness in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eye, a sweet smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lip, and serenity on
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brow, joined with the fevered cheek, the air of lassitude, and
the panting, oppressed breath, there was a strange, melancholy
beauty about him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ; and while Amy felt an impulse of ardent,
clinging affection to one so jDrecious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), there was joined with
it a sort of awe and veneration for one who so spoke, looked,
and felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hung over him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and sprinkled him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with Eau-de-
Cologne ; then as his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hair teased him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) by falling into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to cut the front lock off. There was something sad
in doing this, for that ' tumble-down wave,'' as Charlotte called
it, was rather a favourite of Amy's ; it always seemed to have
so much sympatliy with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) moods, and it was as if parting witli
it was resigning him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to a long illness. However, it was too
troublesome not to go, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked amused at the care with
which slie folded up the glossy, brown wave, and treasured it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dressing-case, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) read to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a few verses of a psalm,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) soon fell into another doze. ,

<p/>There was little more of event, day after day. The fever
never ran as high as in Philip's case, and there was no delirium.
Tliere was almost constant torpor, but when for any short space
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was thoroughly awakened, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind was perfectly clear, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke little, and then only on tlie subject immediately pre-
sented to liim. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay for one quiet hour after another,
while Amy sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), with as little consciousness of time as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
liad himself, looking neitlier forward nor backward, only to the
present, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) drink, batlie -RSB-ns face and liands, arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
pillows, or read or repeat some soothing verse. It always was a
surprise when meal times summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to attend to PhilijD,
when slie was asked for the letters for thq post, when evening
twilight gatliered in, or when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had to leave the night-watch
to Arnaud, and go to bed in the adjoining room.

<p/>This was a great trial, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) Avould not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to sit up ;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own sense showed lier that if this was to be a long
illness, it would not do to waste her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) strength. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
was quiet at niglit, and lier trustful temper so calmed and sup-
ported her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), tliat slie was able to sleep, and thus was not as liable
to be overworked as might have been feared, and as Philip
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must be.



<p/>THE HEIll OF REDCLYFFE 341

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) always appeared in Ids room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sweet face mournful
and anxious, but never ruffled, or with any air of haste or discom-
fiture, desirous as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband ; for, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) frequently sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to take care of herself or of Philip, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew
that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was away he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) always grew more restless and uncom-
fortable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) look of relief at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) re-entrance said as much to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as a hundred complaints of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) absence would have done.

<p/>Philip was in the meantime sorely tried by being forced to be
entirely inactive and dependent, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw Amabel in such
need of assistance ; and so far from being able to requite Guy's
care, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could only look on himself as the cause of their distress,
and an addition to it -- a burthen instead of a help. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been
told a little while ago what would be the present state of things,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would almost have laughed the speaker to scorn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would
have thought a child as competent as Amy to the sole manage-
ment of two sick persons, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not able either to advise or cheer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could not see anything went wrong that depended on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) comforts were so cared for, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was often sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
should have troubled herself about them ; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could
have little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) company, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never was allowed to feel himself
deserted. Anne, Arnaud, the old Italian nurse, or Amy herself,
were easily summoned, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) full care and attention.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was, however, necessarily a good deal alone ; and though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) cousin's books were at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) disposal, eyes and head were too
weak for reading, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was left a prey to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own tJiouglits.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) great comfort was, that Guy was less ill than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been
himself, and that there was no present danger ; otherwise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could never have endured the conviction that all had been caused
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own imjDrudence. Imprudence ! Philip was brought very
low to own that such a word apj^lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), yet it would have
been well for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had that been the chief burthen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind.
Was it only an ordinary service of friendship and kindred that
Guy had, at the peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own life, rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) 1 Was it
not a positive return of good for evil ? Yes, evil ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) now
called that evil, or at least harshness and hastiness in judgment,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had hitherto deemed true friendship and consideration
for Guy and Amy. Every feeling of distrust and jealousy had
been gradually softening since his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) recovery began ; gratitude had
done much, and dismay at Guy's illness did more. It would
have been noble and generous in Guy to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had done, had
Philip's surmises been correct, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began to doubt, though
it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only justification, and even to wish to lose it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
rather believe Guy blameless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would do so, if possible ; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) resolved, on the first opportunity, to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) one
last assurance that all was right, and implicitly believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).
But how was it possible again to assume to be a ruler and judge
over Guy after it was known how egregiously he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) himself had
erred ? There was shame, sorrow, self-humiliation, and anxiety
where^•er he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned, and it was no wonder that depression of
spirits retarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) recovery.



<p/>342 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>It was not till the tenth day after Guy's illness had begun that
Philip was able to be dressed, and to come into the next room,
where Amabel had promised to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay on the
sofa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked even more ill than in bed, the change
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) former appearance being rendered more visible, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
great height making him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) look the more thin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was api3arently
exhausted with the exertion of dressing, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was very silent
all dinner-time, though Amabel could have better talked to-day
than for some time past, since Guy had had some refreshing
sleep, was decidedly less feverish, seemed better for nourishing
food, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wanted nothing but a puff of Eedclyfte
wind to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was pleased to hear of Philip's step
in recovery, and altogether. Amy was cheered and happy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cousin as soon as dinner was over, and did not
come to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) again for nearly an hour and a half. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was then
surprised to find him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) finishing a letter, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head on one
hand, and looking wan, weary, and very unhappy.

<p/>' Have you come to letter writing 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) answered, in a worn, dejected tone, <div class="bookquote">``I must ask you
to direct this. I can't make it legible.''

<p/>' To your sister ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked.

<p/>' No ; to yours. I never wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) before. There's one
enclosed to your father, to tell all.''

<p/>' I am glad you have done it,'' answered Amy, in a quiet tone
of sincere congratulation. ' You will be better now it is off your

<p/>' I must rest first ' -- and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice failing, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid back on the
sofa, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, turned ashy pale, and became so faint that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and was obliged to apply every restora-
tive within reach before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back to a state of
tolerable comfort.

<p/>The next minute her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) work was nearly undone, when Anne
came in to ask for the letters for tlie post. ' Shall I send yours ? '
asked Amy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) muttered an assent. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked back to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
after speaking to Anne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw a tremulous, almost convulsed
working of the closed eyes and mouth, while the thin hands
were clenched together with a force contrasting witli the help-
less manner in wliich they had hung a moment before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
guessed at the intensity of anguish it must cost a temper so
proud, a heart of so strong a mould, and feelings so deep, to take
the first irrevocable step in self-humiliation, giving up into tlie
hands of others the engagement tliat had liitherto been tlie
cherished treasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life ; and above .all, in exposing Laura
to bear tlie brunt of the penalty of the fault into which lie had
led her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). ' Oh, for Guy to comfort liim,'' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), feeling
herself entirely incompetent, dreading to intrude on liis feelings,

<p/>yet thinking it unkind to go away witliout one sympathizing
word when lie was in such distress.

<p/>' You will be glad, in time,'' at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) held the stimulants to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again, and tried to arrange
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) more comfortably.

<p/>I Thank you,'' at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said. ' How is Guy ? '

<p/>I He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has just had another nice quiet sleep, and is quite refreshed.''

<p/>' That is a blessing, at least. But does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) want you ? I
have been keeping you a long time ? '

him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) about PhilijD.

to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) father, while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suggested and approved. It was a treat
mdeed to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) able to consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) once more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
looked so much relieved and so much better, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) felt as if
it was the beginning of real improvement, though still his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pulse
was fast, and the fever, though lessened, was not gone.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV

<p/>Sir,

<p/>It is your faiilt I have loved Posthunms ;
You bred him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as my playfellow ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
A man worth any woman, over-buys me
Almost the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pays.-- Cymbeline

<p/>The first tidings of Philip's illness arrived at Holly well one
morning at breakfast, and were thus announced by Charles --

<p/>' There ! So he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has been and gone and done it.''

<p/>*What? Who? Not Guy?''

<p/>' Here has the Captain gone and caught a regular bad fever,
in some malaria hole ; delirious, and all that sort of thing, and
of course our wise brother and sister must needs go and nurse
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by way of a pretty little interlude in tlieir wedding tour ! '

<p/>Laura's voice alone was unheard in the chorus of inquiry. 8he
sat cold, stiff, and silent, devouring Avitli her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ears each reply, tliat
fell like a death-blow, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was mechanically continuing the
occupations of breakfast. When all was told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
own room, but the want of sympathy was becoming intolerable.
If Amabel had been at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) must have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) all There
was no one else ; and the misery to be endured in silence was
dreadful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) dearest -- her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) whole joy and hope-- suffering,
dying, and to hear all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) with kindness,
indeed, but what to lier seemed indifference ; blaming him (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) for
wilfulness, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had drawn it on liimself, -- it seemed to
drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wild. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) conjured up pictures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sufferings, and
dreaded Guy's inexperience, the want of medical advice, imagin-
ing everything that was terrible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) idol, to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) whole
soul was devoted, was passing from lier, and no one pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ;
while the latent consciousness of disobedience debarred her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) from
gaining solace from the only true source. All was blank desola-
tion -- a wild agony, untempered by resignation, unclieered by
prayer ; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did pray, it was witliout trust, without
hope, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wretchedness was rendered more overwlielming
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) efforts to conceal it. Tliese were so far ineffectual tliat
no one could help perceiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was extremely unliappy ;
but then all the family knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was very fond of Philip, and
neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother nor brother could be surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) distress,
though it certainly appeared to them excessive. JNIrs. Edmon-
stone was very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>), and very affectionate and consider-
ate ; but Laura was too mucli absorbed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own feelings
to perceive or to be grateful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) kindness ; and as each day
brought a no better report, her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) despair became so engrossing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not attempt any employment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wandered in
the garden, sat in dreamy fits of silence in the house, and at
last, after receiving one of the worst accounts, sat up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
dressing-gpwn the whole of one night, in one dull, lieavy,
motionless trance of misery.



<p/>THE HETli OF REDCLYFFE 345

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must act her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) part, dressed in the
morning and came down ; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looks were ghastly ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tasted
no food, and as soon as possible left the breakfast-rOom. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
motlier was going in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) when old nurse came with an
anxious face to say, -- ``Ma'am, I am afraid Miss Edmonstone
must be very ill, or something. Do you know, ma'am, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) bed
lias not been slept in all night 1 '

<p/>' You don't say so, nurse ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, Jane told me so, and I went to look myself.
Poor child, slie is half distracted about Master Philip, and no
wonder, for they were always together ; but I thought you ought
to know, ma'am, for slie will make herself ill, to a certainty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I am going to see about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) this moment, nurse,'' said Mrs.
Edmonstone ; and presently slie found Laura wandering up and
down the shady walk, in the restlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) despair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laura, dearest,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I can-
not bear to see you so unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura did not answer ; for though solitude was oppressive,
every one's presence was a burthen.

<p/>' I cannot think it right to give way thus,'' continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
mother. ' Did you really sit up all night, my poor child ? '

<p/>' I don't know. They did so with him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' My dear, this will never do. You are making yourself seri-
ously unwell'

<p/>' I wish -- I wish I was ill ; I wish I was dying ! ' broke from
Laura, almost unconsciously, in a hoarse, inward voice.

<p/>' My dear ! You don't know what you are saying. You for-
get that this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief would be
wrong in any one ; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming
in you.''

<p/>Laura's over-wrought feelings could bear no more, and in a
tone which, though too vehement to be addressed to a parent,
had in it an agony which almost excused it, by showing how
unable she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was to restrain herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) broke forth : -- ' Unbecom-
ing ! Who has a right to grie\'e for him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) but me ? -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) chosen, -- the only one who can love him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), or understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).''
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) voice died away in a sob, though without tears.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother heard the words, but did not take in their full
meaning ; and, belie\`ing that Laura's undeveloped affection had
led her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to this uncontrolled grief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) spoke again, with coldness,
intended to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to a sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was compromising her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
womanly dignity.

<p/>' Take care, Laura ; a woman has no right to speak in such a
manner of a man who has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) no reason to believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Preference! It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love! -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love! His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) whole heart!

You little guess what we have felt for each other ! '

<p/>' Laura ! ' Mrs. Edmonstone stood still, overpowered. ' What
do you mean ? ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not put the question more plainly.



<p/>346 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* What have I done 1 ' cried Laura. * I have betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ! '
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) answered herself in a tone of despair, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hands'; `betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is dying ! '

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother was too much shocked to speak in the soft
reluctant manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was wont to reprove.

<p/>' Laura,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), ' I must understand this. What has passed
between you and Philip 'i '

<p/>Laura only replied by a flood of tears, ungovernable from the
exhaustion of sleeplessness and want of food. Mrs. Edmonstone's
kindness returned ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to control her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)-
self, and at length brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) into the house, and up to the
dressing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) sank on the sofa, weeping violently.
It was tlie reaction of tlie long restraint she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been exercising
on herself, and the silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been maintaining. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was
not feeling the humiliation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own acknowledgment of dis-
obedience, but of the horror of being forced to reveal the secret
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) charge.

<p/>Long did she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) weep, breaking out more piteously at each at-
tempt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to explain. Poor Mrs. Edmon-
stone was alarmed and perplexed beyond measure ; this half con-
fession had so overthrown all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) ideas that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) was ready to
apprehend everything most improbable, and almost expected to
hear of a private marriage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) presence seemed only to make
Laura worse, and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said, -- ' I shall leave you for half
an hour, in hopes that by that time you may have recovered
yourself, and be able to give the explanation which I required

<p/>Bhe went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own room, and waited, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) watch, a prey to every strange alarm and anticipation, griev-
ously liurt at tliis want of confidence, and wounded, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
least expected it, by both daughter and nephew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thouglit,
guessed, recollected, wondered, tormented herself, and at the last
of the thirty minutes, hastily opened the door into the dressing-
room. Laura sat, as before, crouched up in the corner of the
wide sofa ; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's entrance,
it was bewildered rather than embarrassed.

<p/>' Well, Laura ? ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) waited unanswered ; and the wretched-
ness of the look so touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), that, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said,
' Surely, my dear, you need not be afraid to tell me anything 1 '

<p/>Laura did not respond to the kindness, but asked, looking
perplexed, ' What have I said ? Have I told it ? '

<p/>' What ? You have given me reason to believe,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs.
Edmonstone, trying to bring herself to speak it explicitly, ' that
you think Philip is attached to you. You do not deny it. Let
me know on what terms you stand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Without looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) murmured, ' If you would not force it
from me at such a time.''

<p/>' Laura, it is for your own good. You are wretched now, my poor
child ; why not relieve yourself by telling all 1 If you have not
acted openly, can you have any comfort till you have confessed ?
It may be a painful eflbrt, but relief will come afterwards.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 347

<p/>' I have nothing to confess/ said Laura. ' There is no such
tiling as you think.''

<p/>' No engagement ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Then what am I to understand by your exclamations ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is no engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>repeated Laura. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would never
have asked that without papa's consent. We are only bound by
our own hearts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' And you have a secret understanding with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' We have never written to each other ; we have never dreamed
of any intercourse that could be called clandestine. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would
scorn it. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waited only for his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) promotion, to declare it to papa.''

<p/>' And how long has it been declared to you ? '

<p/>' Ever since the first summer Guy was here.''

<p/>' Three years ! ' exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother. ' You have kept this
from me three years ! O Laura ! '

<p/>' It was of no use to speak ! ' said Laura, faintly.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had looked up, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would have seen those words, ' no use,''
cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother more deeply than all ; but there was only coldness
in the tone of the answer, ' No use to inform your parents, before
you pledged your affections ! '

<p/>' Indeed, mamma,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura, ' I was sure that you knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
worth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>' Worth ! when he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was teaching you to live in a course of
insincerity 1 Your father will be deeply hurt.''

<p/>' Papa ! Oh, you must not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) ! Now, I have betrayed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>), indeed ! Oh, my weakness ! ' and another paroxysm of tears
came on,

<p/>' Laura, you seem to think you owe nothing to any one but
Philip. You forget you are a daughter ! that you have been
keeping up a system of disobedience and concealment, of which
I could not have believed a child of mine could be capable. O
Laura, how you have abused our confidence ! '

<p/>Laura was touched by the sorrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tone ; and, throwing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) neck, sobbed out, ' You will forgive me, only
forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ! '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was softened in a moment. ' Forgive you,
my poor child ! You have been very unhappy ! ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), with many tears.

<p/>' Must you tell papa ? ' whispered Laura.

<p/>' Judge for yourself, Laura. Could I know such a thing, and
hide it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>Laura ceased, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) determined, and yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) pity,
allowing herself to be nursed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) required, so exhausted was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was laid on the sofa, and made comfortable with pillows,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's gentlest way. When Mrs. Edmonstone was called
away, Laura held her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) dress, saying, ' You are kind to me ; but you
must forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>). Say you have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>), mamma, dearest ! '

<p/>' JSIy dear, in the grave all tilings are forgiven.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not help saying so ; but, feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had been



<p/>348 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>cruel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) added, ' I mean, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) is so ill, we cannot enter on
such a matter. I am very sorry for you,'' proceeded she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), still
arranging for Laura's ease ; then kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would
sleep, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>Sympathy was a matter of necessity to Mrs. Edmonstone ; and
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband was out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) went at once to Charles, with a
countenance so disturbed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feared some worse tidings had
come from Italy.

<p/>' No, no, nothing of that sort ; it is poor Laura.''

<p/>' Eh ? ' said Charles, with a significant though anxious look,
tliat caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to exclaim, -- ■

<p/>' Surely you had no susijicion ! '

<p/>Charlotte, who was reading in the window, trembled lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
should be seen, and sent away.

<p/>' I suspected poor Laura had parted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart. But what
do you mean ? What has happened ? '

<p/>``Could you have guessed 1 but first remember how ill he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is ;
don't be violent, Charlie. Could you have guessed that they have
been engaged, ever since the summer we first remarked them ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had expected a great storm : but Charles only observed,
very coolly, ' Oh ! it is come out at last ! '

<p/>' You don't mean that you knew it ? '

<p/>' No, indeed, you don't think they would choose me for their
confidant ? '

<p/>' Not exactly,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, with the odd sort of
laugh with which even the most sensitive people, in the height
of their troubles, reply to anything ludicrous ; ' but really,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
continued, ' every idea of mine is so turned upside-down, that
I don't know what to think of anybody.''

<p/>' We always knew Laura to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) slave and automaton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
is so infallible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes, that no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) silence
an act of praiseworthy resolution.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was a mere child, poor dear,<div class="bookquote">'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother ; ' only
eighteen ! Yet Amy was but a year older last summer. How
unlike ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must have known what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>' ' Not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) senses surrendered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), without volition of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own. I wonder by what magnetism he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to tell? '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has gone through a great deal, poor child, and I am afraid
there is much more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to sufter, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) reco^`ers or not.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) will recover,'' said Charles, with the decided manner in
which people prophesy the restoration of those they dislike,
probably from a feeling that they must not die, till there is
more charity in their opinion of them.

<p/>' Your father will be so grieved.''

<p/>' Well, I suppose we must begin to make the best of it,'' said
Charles. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has been as good as married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) these four
years, for any use she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has been to us ; it has been only the name
of the thing • so he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had better '

<p/>' My dear Charlie, what are you talking of ? You don't imagine
they can marry 1 '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 349

<p/>' They will some time or other ; for assuredly neither will marry
any one else. You will see if Guy does not take up the cause,
and return Philip's meddling -- whicli, by tlie bye, is now shown
to liave been more preposterous still -- ^by setting their affairs in
order for them.''

<p/>' Dear Guy, it is a comfort not to have been deceived in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) -RRB- '

<p/>' Except when you believed Philip,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Could anytliing have been more different 1 ' jDroceeded Mrs.
Edmonstone ; ' yet the two girls had the same training.''

<p/>' With an important exception,'' said Charles ; <div class="bookquote">``Laura is Philip's
pupil, Amy mine ; and I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) little ladyship is the best
turned out of hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' How shocked Amy will be ! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was but liere, it would be
much better, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) always had more of Laura's confidence
than I. Oil, Charlie, there has been the error ! ' and Mrs.
Edmonstone's eyes were full of tears. ' What fearful mistake
have I made to miss my daughter's confidence ! '

<p/>' You must not ask me, mother,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, face and voice
full of affectionate emotion. ' I know too well that I have been
exacting and selfish, taking too much advantage of your anxieties
for me, and that if you were not enough with my sisters when
they were young girls, it was my fault as mucli as my misfortune.
But, after all, it has not hurt Amy in the least ; nor do I think
it will hurt Charlotte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Charlotte did not venture to give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) desire to kiss
lier mother, and thank Charles, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) should be exiled as an
intruder.

<p/>' And,<div class="bookquote">'' proceeded Charles, serious, though somewhat roguish,
' I suspect that no attention would have made much difference.
You were always too young, and Laura too much addicted to
the physical sciences to get on together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A mother</b></font>)</div><p/>' A weak, silly mother,'' sighed Mrs. Edmonstone.

<p/>This was too much for Charlotte, who sprang forward, and
flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) neck, sobbing out, --

<p/>' Mamma ! dear mamma ! don't say such horrid things ! No
one is half so wise or so good, -- I am sure Guy thinks so too ! '

<p/>At the same time Bustle, perceiving a commotion, made a leap,
planted his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fore-feet on Mrs. Edmonstone's lap, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tail
vehemently, and trying to lick lier face. It was not in human
nature not to laugh ; and Mrs. Edmonstone did so as heartily as
either of the young ones ; indeed, Cliarlotte was the first to resume
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) gravity, not being sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ground, and being hurt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
impulse of affection being thus reduced to the absurd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) began
to apologize, --

<p/>' Dear mamma, I could not helj^ it. I thought you knew I was
in the room.''

<p/>' My dear child,<div class="bookquote">'' and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) warmly, ' I don't
want to hide anything from you. You are my only home-daughter
now.''  (<font color='red'><b>child mother</b></font>)</div>Then recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) prudence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) proceeded, -- ' You are
old enough to understand the distress this insincerity of poor



<p/>350 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Laura's has occasioned,-- and now that Amy is gone, we must
look to you to comfort us.''

<p/>Did ever maiden of fourteen feel more honoured, and obliged
to be very good and wise than Charlotte, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knelt by Tier
mother's side ? Happily tact was coming with advancing years,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not attempt to mingle in the conversation, which
was resumed by Charles observing that the strangest part of the
affair was the incompatibility of so novelish and imprudent
a proceeding with the cautious, thoughtful character of both
parties. It was, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said, analogous to a pentagon flirting with
a hexagon ; whereas Guy, a knight of the Round Table, in name
and nature, and Amy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little superstitions, liad been
attached in the most matter-of-fact, hum-drum way, and were in
a course of li^^.ng very happy ever after, for which nature could
never have designed them. Mrs. Edmonstone smiled, sighed,
hoped they were prudent, and wondered whether camphor and
chloride of lime were attainable at Recoara.

<p/>Laura came down no more that day, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was worn out with
agitation, and it was a relief to be sufticiently unwell to be ex-
cused facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father and Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had little hope that
Charlotte had not heard all ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might seem to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
ignorant, and could, therefore, endure her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), with
an elaborate kindness and compassion, and tip-toe silence, far
beyond the deserts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) slight indisposition.

<p/>In the evening, Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother broke the tidings to
Mr. Edmonstone as gently as they could, Charles feeling bound
to be the cool, thinking head in the family. Of course Mr. Edmon-
stone stormed, vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) could not have believed it, then
veered round, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) could have predicted it from the first.
It was all mamma's fault for letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) be so intimate with the
girls -- how was a poor lad to be expected not to fall in love ?
Next he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) broke into great wrath at the abuse of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) confidence,
then at the interference with Guy, then at the intolerable pre-
sumption of Philip's thinking of Laura. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would soon let him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought of it ! When reminded of Philip's present
condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) muttered an Irish imprecation on the fever for
interfering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) anger, and abused the ' romantic folly ' that
had carried Guy to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at Recoara. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was not so much
displeased Avitli Laura ; in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought all young ladies always
ready to be fallen in love with, and hardly accountable for what
their lovers might make tliem do, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heartily, wlien
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sitting up all night. Anything of extravagance
in love met with sympathy from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and there was no efibrt in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hearty forgiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) voAved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) should give
the fellow up, and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) been present, would have tried to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) do so at a moment's warning ; but in process of time he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) Avas
convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must not persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) while Philip was in
extremity, and though, like Charles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) scorned the notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
death, and, as if it was an additional crime, pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to be
as strong as a horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was quite ready to put off all proceedings



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 351

<p/>till his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recovery, being glad to defer the evil day of making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cry.

<p/>So when Laura ventured out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) met with nothing harsh ;
indeed, but for the sorrowful kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) family towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could hardly have guessed that they knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) secret.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart leapt when Amabel's letter was silently handed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saw the news of Philip's amendment ; but a sicken-
ing feeling succeeded, that soon all forbearance would be at an
end, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must hear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) weakness had betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) secret.
For the present, however, nothing was said, and slie continued
in silent dread of what each day might bring forth, till one after-
noon, when the letters had been fetched from Broadstone, Mrs.
Edmonstone, with an exclamation of dismay, read aloud : --

<p/>' Rccoara, September Sth.

<p/>``Dearest Mamma, -- Don't be very much friglitened when I
tell you that Guy has caught the fever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) has been ailing since
Sunday, and yesterday became quite ill ; but we hope it will not
be so severe an illness as Philip's was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sleejDS a great deal,
and is in no pain, quite sensible when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is awake. Arnaud is
very useful, and so is Anne ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) is so quiet at night, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
wants no one but Arnaud, and will not let me sit up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>).
Philip is better.

<p/>' Your most affectionate,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A. F. M.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmon</b></font>)</div><p/>The reading was followed by a dead silence, then Mr. Edmon-
stone said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) had always known how it would be, and what
would poor Amy do 1

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was too unhappy to answer, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could
see no means of helping them. Mr. Edmonstone was of no use
in a sick room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had never thought it possible to leave
Charles. It did not even occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could do so till
Charles himself suggested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) must go to Amy.

<p/>' Can you spare me ? ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), as if it was a new light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Who can be thought of but Amy? She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought
not to be a day longer without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mayerne</b></font>)</div><p/>' Dr. Mayerne would look in on you,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), considering,
`and Laura can manage for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Mayerne</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, I shall do very well. Do you think I could bear to keep
you from lier 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some one must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone; `and even if I
could think of letting Laura run the risk, this unhappy affair
about Pliilip puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) going out of the question.''

<p/>' No one but you can go,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' it is of no use to talk
of any tiling else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mrs.</b></font>)</div><p/>It was settled that if the next account was not more favour-
able, Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone should set off for Recoara.
Laura heard, in consternation at the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father's meet-
ing Philip, still weak and unwell, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and perhaps with



<p/>352 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Guy too ill to be consulted. And oli ! what would Philip think
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) weakness had disclosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) secret, and sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must hear it from others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
could have thrown herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's feet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) implored
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to forbear, to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
incoherent distress, but it did not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feel more in charity
with Philip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would not promise that the subject should not
be discussed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tried to reassure Laura, by saying, that
nothing should be done that could retard his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) recovery.

<p/>With this Laura was obliged to content herself ; and early
the second morning, after the letter arrived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) watched the
departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father and mother.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had exi3ected to find the care of Cliarles very anxious
work, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) prospered beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very kind
and considerate, and both he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Charlotte were so sobered by
anxiety, that tliere was no fear of their spirits overpowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>Mary E-oss used to come almost every afternoon to inquire. One
day she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found Charles alone, crutching himself slowly along the
terrace, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought nothing showed the forlorn state of the
family so much as to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out of doors with no one for a prop.

<p/>' Mary ! Just as I wanted you ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What account?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), taking the place of one of the
crutches.

<p/>' Excellent ; the fever and drowsiness seem to be going off.
It must have been a Ught attack, and the elders will hardly
come in time for mamma to have any nursing. So there's Guy
pretty well off one's mind.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Amy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' This was such a long letter, and so cheerful, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must
be all right. What I wanted to speak to you about was Laura.
You know the state of things. Well, the captain -- I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
was not so sorry, it deprives one of the satisfaction of abusing
him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) -- the captain, it seems, was brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) senses by his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)
illness, confessed all to Guy, and now has written to tell the
wliole truth to my father.''

<p/>' Has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ? That is a great relief ! '

<p/>' Not that I have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) letter ; Laura ran away with it, and
has not said a word of it. I know it from one to papa from Amy,
trying to make the best of it, and telling how thoroughly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
cut up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all but fainted after writing. Fancy that
poor little thing with a great man, six foot one, fainting away
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands ! '

<p/>' I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was pretty well again.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be to have written at all, and a pretty tolerably
bitter pill it must have been to set about it. What a thing for
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have had to tell Guy, of all people-- I do enjoy that !
So, of course, Guy takes up his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cause, and sends a message, tliat
is Avorth anything, as showing he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is himself better, though in
any one else it would be a proof of delirium. My two brothers-
in-law might sit for a picture of the contrast.''

<p/>``Then you tliink Mr. Edmonstone will consent ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure ; we shall have him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) coming home, saying --

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Where is Laura 1 ' said Mary, smiling.

<p/>' I turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) out to walk with Charlotte, and I want some
counsel, as mamma says I know nothing of lovers.*

<p/>' Because I know so much ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know feminine nature. I want to know what is the

her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) out to mope alone, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) likes best ; but I wish you would
tell me how to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I know nothing better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) than waiting on you.''

<p/>' That's hard,'' said Charles, ' that having made the world dance
attendance on me for my j^leasure, I must now do it for theirs.
But what do you think about telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of this letter, or show-
ing it, remembering that not a word about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) troubles has
passed between us ? '

<p/>' By all means tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). You must judge about showing it,
but I should think the opening for talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on the subject
a great gain.''

<p/>' Should you 1 What, thinking as I do of the man 1 Should
I not be between the horns of a dilemma if I had to sjDeak the
honest truth, yet not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) feelings ? '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has been so long shul up from sympathy, that any prooi
of kindness must be a comfort.''

<p/>' Well, I should like to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) some good ; but it will be a
mercy, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) does not make me fall foul of Philip ! I can get up
a little Christian charity, when my father or Charlotte rave at
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but I can't stand hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) praised. I take the oppor-
tunity of saying so while I can, for I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will come home
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) betrothed, and then we shall not be able to say one word.''

<p/>' No, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be so altered and subdued that you
will not be so disposed to rail. This confession is a grand thing.
Good-bye ; I must get back to church. Poor Laura ! how busy

<p/>As soon as Charlotte was gone to bed, Charles, in accordance
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) determination, said to Laura, --

<p/>' Have you anv fancy for seeing Amy's letter 1 *

<p/>' Thank you ; and, without speaking, Laura took it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
forbore to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) expression as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) read. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
finished, her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face was fixed in silent unhappiness.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has been suffering a great deal, I am sure,'' said Charles,
kindly. It was the first voluntary word of compassion towards
Philip that Laura had heard, and it was as grateful as unexpected.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face softened, and tears gushed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said, --

<p/>' You do not know how much. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is grieving for me !
thinking they will be angry with me, and hurting himself with
that ! Oh ! if this had but come before they set off ! '

<p/>' Guy and Amy will tell them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) having written.''

<p/>' Dear, dear Guy and Amy ! He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) speaks so earnestly of their
kindness. I don't fear it so much now he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) and Guy understand
each other.''

<p/>Recollecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) love, Charles refrained, only saying, ``You
can rely on their doing everything to make it better.

<p/>' I can hardly bear to think of what we owe to them,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura.
' How glad I am that Amy was there after he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wrote, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was so much overcome ! Amy has written me such a very kind
note ; I think you must see that-- it is so like her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own dear self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read : --

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>thought Charles, <div class="bookquote">``I see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) won't be satisfied, if my

that Philip has behaved properly, Laura • nothing but being in
love could justify such a delusion ; but I do say that there is
greatness of mind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confessing it, especially at a time when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could put it off, and is so unequal to agitation.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 355

<p/>It was the absence of any tone of satire that made this speech
come home to Laura as it was meant. ' There was no grudging
in the praise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) answered, in a very low, -RSB--RRB-roken voice, --

<p/>' You will think so still more when you see this note, whicli he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
sent open, inside mine, to be given to papa when I had told my
own story. Oh, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) considerateness for me ! '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). The address, ' C. Edmonstone, Esq.,'' was
a mere scrawl, and within the writing was very trembling and
weak. Charles remarked it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) answered by saying that her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
own letter began in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own strong hand, but failed and grew
shaky at the end, as if from fatigue and agitation. The words
were few, brief, and simple, very unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) usual manner of
letter-writing.

<p/>``My dear Uncle, -- My conduct has been unjustifiable -- I
feel it. Do not visit it on Laura -- I alone should suffer. I entreat
your pardon, and my aunt's, and leave all to you. I will write
more at length. Be kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). -- Yours affectionately,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ph. M.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Poor Philip ! ' said Charles, really very much touched.

<p/>From that moment, Laura no longer felt completely isolated,
and deprived of sympathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sat by Charles till late that
night, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the whole history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) engagement, much
relieved by the outpouring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) long-hidden griefs, and com-
forted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) kindness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not absolutely refrain
from words and gestures of censure. It was as strange that
Charles should be the first person to whom Laura told this his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-
tory, as that Guy should have been Philip's first confidant.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXV

<p/>There is a Rock, and nigh at liand,

<p/>A shadow in a weary land,

<p/>Who in that stricken Rock hath rest,

<p/>Finds water gushing from its breast. -- Neale

<p/>In the meantime the days passed at Recoara without much
change for the better or worse. After the first week, Guy's
fever had diminished ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse was lower, the drowsiness ceased,
and it seemed as if there was nothing to prevent absolute re-
covery. But though each morning seemed to bring improve-
ment, it never lasted ; the fever, though not high, could never
be entirely reduced, and strength was perceptibly wasting, in
spite of every means of keeping it up.

<p/>There was not much positive suffering, ^`ery little even of
headache, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was cheerful, though sjiteaking little, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was told not to excite or exhaust himself. Languor and lassi-
tude were the chief causes of discomfort ; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) strength
failed, there came fits of exhaustion and oppression that tried
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) severely. At first, these were easily removed by stimulants ;

<p/>A A z

<p/>but remedies seemed to lose their effect, and the sinking was
ahnost death-like.

<p/>' I think I could bear acute pain better ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said one day ; and
more than once the sigh broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) almost unconsciously,
-- ' Oh for one breath of Redclyffe sea-wind ! ' Indeed, it seemed
as if the close air of the shut-in-valley, at the end of a long hot
day, was ahnost enough to overwhelm him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), weak as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had
become. Every morning, when Amabel let in the fresh breeze
at the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) predicted it would be a cool day, and do him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
good ; every afternoon the wind abated, the sun shone full in,
the room was stifling, the f aintness came on, and after a few vain
attempts at relieving it, Guy sighed that there was nothing for
it but quiet, and Amy was obliged to acquiesce. As the sun set,
the breeze sprung ujo, it became cooler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fell asleep, awoke
revived, was comfortable all the evening, and Amy left him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at
eleven or twelve, with hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) having a good night.

<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as if ages had passed in this way, when one
evening two letters were brought in.

<p/>' From mamma ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; ' and this one,'' holding it up, ' is
for you. It must have been hunting us everywhere. How many
different directions ! '

<p/>' From Markham,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' It must be the letter we were
waiting for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter to tell them Redclyffe was ready to receive them !
Amabel put it down with a strange sensation, and ojDened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
mother's. With a start of joy she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) exclaimed --

<p/>' They are coming-- mamma and papa ! '

<p/>' Then all is right ! '

<p/>' If we do not receive a much better account,<div class="bookquote">'' read Amy, ' we
shall set off early on Wednesday, and hope to be with you not
long after you receive this letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, I am so glad ! I wonder how Charlie gets on without her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

<p/>' It is a great comfort,'' said Guy.

<p/>' Now you will see what a nurse mamma is ! '

<p/>' Now you will be properly cared for.''

<p/>* How nice it will be ! She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) will take care of you all night,
and never be tired, and devise everything I am too stupid for,
and make you so comfortable ! '

<p/>' Nay, no one could do that better than you. Amy. But it is
joy indeed -- to see mamma again -- to know you are safe with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Everything -comes to make it easy ! ' The last words were
spoken very low ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) by saying any-
thing till he (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) asked about the rest of the letter, and desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
to read Markham's to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).

<p/>This cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) some pain, for it had been written in ignorance
of even Philip's illness, and detailed triumphantly the prepara-
tions at Redclyffe, hinting that they must sen^ timely notice
of their return, or they would disappoint the tenantry, who in-
tended grand doings, and concluding with a short lecture on the
inexpediency of lingering in foreign parts.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 357

<p/>' Poor Markham,'' said Guy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) understood ; but these things did not come on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) like a
shock now, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been saying them more or less ever since the
beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) illness ; and fully occupied as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never
opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind to the future. After a long silence, Guy said--

<p/>' I am very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). I have been making Arnaud write
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) for me.''

<p/>' Oh, have you T

<p/>' It was better for you not to do it ; Arnaud has written for me
at night. You will send it. Amy, and another to my poor uncle.''

<p/>' Very well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).

<p/>' I have told Markham,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) presently, ' to send you my
desk. There are all sorts of things in it, just as I threw them
in when I cleared out my rooms at Oxford. I had rather nobody
but you saw some of them. There is nothing of any importance,
so you may look at them when you please, or not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) without answering. If there had been any
struggle to retain him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), it would have been repressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) calm-
ness ; but the thought had not come on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) suddenly, it was
more like an inevitable fate seen at first at a distance, and
gradually advancing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had never fastened on the
hope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) recovery, and it had dwindled in an almost imper-
ceptil^le manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) kept watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
thoughts, without stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mind to suppose herself living
without him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ; and was supported by the forgetfulness of self,
which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) no time to realize her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>' I sliould like to have seen Redclyffe bay again,'' said Guy,
after a space. ``Now that mamma is coming, that is the one
thing. I suppose I had set my heart on it, for it comes back to
me how I reckoned on standing on that rock with you, feeling
the wind, hearing the surge, looking at the meeting of earth
and sky, and the train of sunlight.<div class="bookquote">'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke slowlv, pausing
between each recollection, -- ' You will see it some day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) added.
' But I must give it up ; it is earth after all, and looking back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Through the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed to be dwelling on thoughts
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own, and only spoke to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) of some message to friends
at Redclyffe, or Hollywell, to mention little Marianne Dixon, or
some other charge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wished to leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
liad mentioned almost every one with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had had any
interchange of kindness at either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) homes, even to old nurse
at Hollywell, remembering them all with quiet pleasure. At
half -past eleven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sent her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to bed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) went submissively,
cheered by thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) likely to sleep.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) could conscientiously call the night over, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and was received with one of the sweet, sunny,
happy looks that had always been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) peculiar charm, and, of
late, had acquired an expression almost startling from their very
beauty and radiance. It was hardly to be termed a smile, for
there was very little, if any, movement of the lips, it was more
like the reflection of some glory upon the whole countenance.



<p/>358 THE HEIR OF BEDCLYFFE

<p/>' You have liad a good night ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said.

<p/>' I have had my wish, I have seen EedclyfFe ; ' then, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
look startled, ' Of course, it was a sort of wandering ; but I
never quite lost the consciousness of being here, and it was very
delightful. I saw the waves, each touclied with light, -- the foam
-- tlie sea-birds, floating in shade and light, -- the trees -- the Shag
-- the sky -- oh ! such a glory as I never knew -- themselves -- but
so intensely glorious ! '

<p/>' I am glad,'' said Amabel, with a strange participation of the
delight it had given him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>``I don't understand sucli goodness ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``As if it
were not enough to look to heaven beyond, to have this longing
gratified, wliich I thought I ought to conquer. Oh, Amy ! is
not that being Fatherly ? '

<p/>' Yes, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now after that, and with mamma's coming -LRB-for you will
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) if I don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)-RRB-, I have but one wish unfulfilled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! a clergyman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; but if that is withheld, I must believe it is rightly
ordered. We must think of tliat Sunday at Stylehurst and
Christmas-day, and that last time at Munich.''

<p/>' Oh, I am so glad we stayed at Munich for that ! '

<p/>' Tliase were times-, indeed ! and many more. Yes ; I have
been a great deal too much favoured already, and now to be
allowed to die just as I should have cliosen '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) broke off to take what Amabel was preparing for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulse. There was fever still, which probably sup-
plied the i^lace of strength, for he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was A^ery comfortable,
and liis eyes were as bright as ever ; but the beats were weak
and fluttering, and a thrill crossed lier that it might be near ;
but slie must attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and could not think.

<p/>When it was time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to go down to breakfast with Pliilip,
Guy said, ' Do you think Philip could come to me to-day ? I
want much to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

<p/>' I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could.''

<p/>' Then pray ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to come, if it Avill not tire him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very much.''

<p/>Philip had, the last two mornings, risen in time to breakfast
witli Amabel, in the room adjoining his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was still very
weak, and attemi:-RRB-ted no more than crossing the room, and sit-
ting in the, balcony to enjoy the evening air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had felt the
heat of the weather severely, and had been a good deal thrown
back by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fatigue and agitation the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wrote the letter,
while also anxiety for Guy was retarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) progress, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) only heard the best side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) condition. J>esides all this,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repentance both for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conduct with regard to Laura and
the hard measure he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had dealt to Guy Avas pressing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
increasingly ; and the wi^rm feelings, hardened and soured by
early disappointment, regained their force, and grew into a love
and admiration that made it still more horrible to perceive that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had acted ungenerously towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 359

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) heard of Guy's desire to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was pleased,
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was quite able to walk up-stairs, had been thinking of
offering to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) by sitting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and was very glad to
hear he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was well enough to wish for a visit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must
prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) for what the conversation was likely to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is very anxious to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is wishing to
set all in order. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) does speak about -- about dying, will
you be so kind as not to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' There is no danger 1 ' cried Philip, startling, with a sort of
agony. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is no worse ? You said the fever was lower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is rather better, I think ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wishes so much to have
everything arranged, that I am sure it will be better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to
have it off his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mind. So, will you bear it, please, Philip ? ' ended
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), with an imploring look, that reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) childhood.

<p/>' How do you bear it ? ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know -- I can't vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip said no more, and only asked when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should come.

<p/>' In an hour's time, perhaps, or wTienever he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was ready,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said,
' for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could rest in the sitting-room before coming in to Guy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found mounting the stairs harder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had expected ;
and, with aching knees and gasping breath, at length reached
the sitting-room, where Amabel was ready to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rest on the sofa till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had fully recovered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) tlien
conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) first glance gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) infinite relief,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw far less change than was still apparent in himself.
Guy's face was at all times too thin to be capable of losing much
of its form • and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was liable to be very much tanned, the
brown, fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face by the sunshine of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) journey, had not
gone off, and a slight flush on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cheeks gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ordinary
colouring ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beautiful hazel eyes were more brilliant than ever ;
and though the hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) held out was hot and wasted, Philip
could not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) nearly as ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been himself, and was
ready to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) talk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pleased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was reassured, too, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
bright smile, and the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke a few
playful words of welcome and congratulation. Amy set a chair,
and with a look to remind Philip to be cautious, glided into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
own room, leaving the door open, so as to see and hear all that
passed, for they were not fit to be left absolutely alone together.

<p/>Philip sat down ; and after a little pause Guy began :

<p/>' There were a few things I wanted to say, in case you should
be my successor at Redclyffe.''

<p/>A horror came over Philip ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw Amy writing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
little table, and felt obliged to refrain.

<p/>' I don't think of directing you,'' said Guy. ' You will make a
far better landlord than I ; but one or two things I should like.*

<p/>' Anything you wish ! '

<p/>' Old Markham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has old-world notions and prejudices ;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) soul is in the family and estate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) heart will be half
broken for me, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) loses his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) occupation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) will be miser-
able. Will you bear with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>), and be patient while he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) lives,



<p/>360 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is cross and absurd in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) objections, and jealous of
all that is not me ? '

<p/>' Yes -- yes-- if '

<p/>' Thank you. Then there is Coombe Prior, I took Wellwood'a
pay on myself. Will you ? And I should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Prior</b></font>) to have the
living. Then there is the school to be built ; and I thought of
enclosing that bit of waste, to make gardens for the people ; but
that you'll do much better. Well ; don't you remember when you
were at RedclyfFe last year' -LRB-Philip winced-RRB- `telling Markham
that bit of green by Sally's gate ought to be taken into the
park ? I hope you won't do that, for it is the only place the
people have to turn out their cows and donkeys. And you won't
cut them oft' from the steps from the Cove, for it saves the old
people from being late for church? Thank you. As to the
rest, it is pleasant to think it will be in such hands if '

<p/>That ' if ' gave Philip some comfort, though it did not mean
Avhat he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fancied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought of Guy's recovery ; Guy referred
to the possibility of Amabel's guardianship.

<p/>' Amy has a list of the old people who have had so much a week,
or their cottages rent-free,<div class="bookquote">'' said Guy. ' If it comes to you, you
will not let them feel the difference 1 And don't turn otF the old
keeper Brown ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) is of no use, but it would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). And Ben
Robinson, who was so brave in the shipwreck, a little notice now
and then would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) straight. Will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) I hope
he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) will never forget that morning-service after the wreck 1 He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
may be glad to think of it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) is as I am now. You tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>),
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) will mind more what comes from a man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div><p/>All this had been spoken with pauses for recollection, and for
Philip's signs of assent. Amabel came to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) some cordial ;
and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had retreated he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went on : -- •

<p/>``My poor uncle ; I have written -- that is, caused Arnaud to
write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>). I hope this may sober him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) ; but one great favour
I have to ask of you. I can't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) money, it would only
be a temptation ; but will you keep an eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>), and let Amy
rely on you to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) when to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) ? I can't ask any one else,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cannot do it for herself ; but you would do it well. A
little kindness might save him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) ; and you don't know how gener-
ous a character it is, run to waste. Will you undertake this ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure I will!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much. You will judge rightly ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has
delicate feelings. Yes, really ; and take care you don't run
against them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another silence followed ; after which Guy said, smiling with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) natural playfulness, ' One thing more. You are the lawyer of
the family, and I want a legal opinion, I have been making
Arnaud write my will. I have wished Miss Wellwood of St.
Mildred's to have' some money for a sisterhood she (<font color='blue'><b>Mildred</b></font>) wants to
establish. Now, should I leave it to herself or name trustees ? '

<p/>Philip heard as if a flash of light was blinding him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
interrupted, with an exclamation :--



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 361

<p/>' Tell me one thing ! Was that the thousand pounds 1 '

<p/>' Yes. I was not at liberty to '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stopped, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was unheard. At the first word Philip
had sunk on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) knees, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face on the bed-clothes, in an
agony of self-abasement, before the goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been relent-
lessly persecuting.

<p/>' It was that ? ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, in a sort of stifled sob. ' Oh, can you
forgive me ? '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not look up ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt Guy's hand touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head,
and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) say, ' That was done long ago. Even as you
pardoned my fierce rage against you, which I trust is forgiven
above. It has been repented ! '

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke there was a knock at the door, and, with the
instinctive dread of being found in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) present posture, Philip
sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feet. Amabel went to the door, and was told that the
physician was down-stairs with two gentlemen ; and a card was
given her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) read the name of an English clergyman.

<p/>' There, again ! ' said Guy. ' Everything comes to me. Now
it is all quite right.''

<p/>Amabel was to go and speak to them, and Guy would see Mr.
Morris, the clergyman, as soon as the physician had made his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)
visit. ' You must not go down,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) then said to Philip. ' You
will wait in the sitting-room, won't you ? We shall want you
again, you know ; ' and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) calm brightness was a contrast to
Philip's troubled look. ' All is clear between us now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added,
as Philip turned away.

<p/>Long ago, letters had been written to Venice, begging that if
an English clergyman should travel that way he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) might be told
how earnestly his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) j^resence was requested ; this was the first who
had answered the summons. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was a very young man, much
out of health, and travelling under the care of a brotlier, who was
in great dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) doing any thing to injure himself. Amabel
soon perceived that, though kind and right-minded, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could not
help them, except as far as his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) ofiice was concerned. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was very
shy, only just in priest's orders ; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had never had this
oflice to perform before, and seemed almost to expect her (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) to direct
him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) ; while his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) brother was so afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) over-exerting himself,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could not hope he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would take charge of Philip.

<p/>However, after the physician had seen Guy, she (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) brought Mr.
Morris to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), and came forward, or remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) room,
according as she (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) husband's face was
at each moment acquiring more unearthly beauty, ancL feeling
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was raised above thought or sensation of personal
sorrow.

<p/>When the first part of the service was over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) exchanged
a few words, out of Guy's hearing, with Mr. Morris, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) said to
her (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), as from the very fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) heart, ' One longs to humble
oneself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>). How it puts one to shame to hear such
repentance with such a confession ! '

<p/>The time came when Philip was wanted. Amabel had called



<p/>362 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>in Anne and the clergyman's brother, and went to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
cousin. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in the sitting-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
face hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) arms, crossed on the table, the whole man
crushed, bowed down, overwhelmed with remorse.

<p/>* We are ready. Come, Philip.''

<p/>' I cannot ; I am not worthy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered, not looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, you are surely in no uncharitableness with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), gently.

<p/>A shudder expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) no.

<p/>' And if you are sorry -- that is repentance -- more fit now than
ever -- Won't you come 1 Would you grieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now ? '

<p/>' You take it on yourself, then,'' said Philip, almost sharply,
raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) haggard face.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not shrink, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``A broken and contrite
heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a drop of balm, a softening drop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rose, and
trembling from head to foot, from the excess of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) agitation,
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) into Guy's room.

<p/>The rite was over, and stillness succeeded the low tones, while all
knelt in their places. Amabel arose first, for Guy, thougli serene,
looked greatly exhausted ; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sprinkled him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with vinegar,
the others stood up. Guy looked for Philip, and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand.
Whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gentle force, or of Philip's own accord Amabel
could not tell ; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay with that look of perfect peace and
love, Philip bent down over him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>' Thank you ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) faintly whispered. ' Good niglit. God bless
you and my sister.''

<p/>Philip went, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added to Amy, <div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow ! It will be
worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) than for you. You must take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hardly heard the last words, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head sunk on one side
in a deathlike faintness, the room was cleared of all but herself,
and Anne fetched the physician at once.

<p/>At length it passed off, and Guy slept. The doctor felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
pulse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opinion of it. Very low and unequal,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was told : his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) strength was failing, and there seemed to be
no power of rallying it, but they must do their best to support
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with cordials, according to the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse. The
physician could not remain all night himself, but would come
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could on the following day.

<p/>Amabel hardly knew when it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) went away ; the two
Mr. Morrises went to the other hotel ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) evening
visit to Philip. It was all like a dream, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could afterwards
scarcely remember, till night had come on, and for the first time
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) found herself allowed to keep watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had slept quietly for some time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) roused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) some wine, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was desired to do constantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
smiled, and said, ' Is no one here but you ? '

<p/>' No one.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My own sweet wife, my Verena, as. you have always been.
We have been very happy together.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 363

<p/>* Indeed we have/ said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), a look of suffering crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thought of their unclouded happiness.

<p/>' It will not be so long before we meet again.''

<p/>' A few months, perhaps ' -- said Amabel, in a stifled voice,
' like your mother -- '

<p/>' No, don't wish that, Amy. You would not wish it to have
no mother.''

<p/>' You will pray ' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could say no more, but struggled

<p/>for calmness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I trust you to it and to mamma for
comfort. And Charlie -- I shall not rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) any longer. I only
borrowed you for a little while,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, smiling. ' In a little
while we shall meet. Years and months seem alike now. I am
sorry to cause you so much grief, my Amy, but it is all as it
should be, and we have been very happy.''

<p/>Amy listened, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) eyes intently fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), unable to rejDress
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) agitation, except by silence. After some little time, he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke
again. <div class="bookquote">``My love to Charlie -- and Laura -- and Charlotte, my
brother and sisters. How kindly they have made me one of
them ! I need not ask Charlotte to take care of Bustle, and
your father will ride Deloraine. My love to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deloraine</b></font>), and earnest
thanks, for you above all. Amy. And dear mamma ! I must
look now to meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in a brighter world ; but tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) how
I have felt all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) kindness since I first came in my strangeness
and grief. How kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was ! how she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) helped me and led me,
and made me know what a mother was. Amy, it will not hurt
you to hear it was your likeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) that first taught me to
love you. I have been so very happy, I don't understand it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was again silent, as in contemplation, and Amabel's over-
coming emotion had been calmed and chastened down again, now
that it was no longer herself that was spoken of. Both were
still, and he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed to sleep a little. When next he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke, it
was to ask if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could repeat their old favourite lines in Sintram.
They came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lips, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) repeated them in a low, steady voice.

<p/>Wlien death is coming near,
And thy heart shrinks in fear,

<p/>And thy limbs fail,
Then raise thy hands and pray
To Him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) who smooths the way

<p/>Through the dark vale.
Seest thou the eastern dawn?
Hear`st thou, in the red morn.

<p/>The angel's song?
Oh ! lift thy drooping head,
Thou, who in gloom and dread

<p/>Hast lain so long.

<p/>Death comes to set thee free,
Oh! meet him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) cheerily,

<p/>As thy true friend
And all thy fears shall cease,
And in eternal peace

<p/>Thy penance end.

<p/>' In eternal peace,'' repeated Guy ; ' I did not think it would
have been so soon. I can't think where the battle has been.

<p/>I never thought my life could be so bright. It was a foolish
longing, when first I was ill, for the cool waves of Redclyffe bay
and that shipwreck excitement, if I was to die. This is far
better. Read me a psalm. Amy, <div class="bookquote">'' Out of the deep.'' (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perfect happiness that would not
let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) grieve, though a dull heavy sense of consternation was
growing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). So it went on througli the night -- not a long,
nor a dreary one -- but more like a dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) dozed and woke,
said a few tranquil words, and listened to some prayer, psalm,
or verse, then slept again, apparently without suffering, except
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tried to take the cordials, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did witli such
increasing difficulty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hardly knew how to bear to cause
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) so much pain, though it was the last lingering hope. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
strove to swallow them, each time v>^ith the mechanical ' Thank
you,'' so affecting Avhen thus spoken ; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came to,
<div class="bookquote">``It is of no use ; I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew all hope was gone, and sat still, watching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). The darkness lessened, and twiliglit came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) slept, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) breath grew short, and unequal ; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wiped the
moisture on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew it was the death-damp.

<p/>Morning light came on -- the church bell rang out matins --
the white hills were tipped with rosy light. His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pulse was
almost gone -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hand was cold. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes.
' Amy ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, as if bewildered, or in pain.
' Here, dearest ! '
' I don't see.''

<p/>At that moment the sun was rising, and the light streamed in
at the open window, and over the bed ; but it was ' another dawn
than ours ' that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) beheld, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) most beautiful of all smiles beamed
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, ' Glory in the Highest ! -- peace -- good-
will ' -- A struggle for breath gave an instant's look of pain ; then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) whispered so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could but just hear--' The last prayer.<div class="bookquote">''
She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) read the Commendatory Prayer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew not the exact
moment, but even as she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said ' Amen ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perceived it was over.
The soul was with Him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) with whom dwell the spirits of just men
made perfect ; and there lay the earthly part with a smile on the
face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) closed the dark fringed eyelids -- saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) look more
beautiful than in sleep-- then, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) face down on the bed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knelt on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took no heed of time, no heed of aught that
was earthly. How long she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knelt she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) never knew, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
roused by Anne's voice in a frightened sob--' My lady, my lady-
come away ! Oh, Miss Amabel, you sliould not be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, and Anne afterwards told Mary Ross,
`she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should never forget how my lady looked. It was not
grief : it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been a little way with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband,
and was just called back.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose -- looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face again -- saw Arnaud was at hand
--let Anne lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) into the next room, and shut the door.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI

<p/>The matron who alone has stood
AVhen not a prop seemed left below,

<p/>The first lorn hour of widowhood,
Yet cheered and cheering all the while,
With sad but unaffected smile.-- Christian Year

<p/>The four months' wife was a widow before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was twenty-
one, and there -she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loneliness, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) maid weeping,
seeking in vain for something to say that might comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
struck with fear at seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thus composed. It might be said
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not yet realized her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) situation, but the truth was,
perhaps, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in the midst of the true realities. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) Guy was perfectly happy-- happy beyond thought
or comparison -- and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was so accustomed to rejoice with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),
that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind had not yet opened to understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) joy left
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mourning and desolate.

<p/>Thus she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remained motionless for some minutes, till she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
startled by a sound of weeping -- those fearful overpowering sobs,
so terrible in a strong man forced to give way.

<p/>' Philip ! ' thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ; and withal Guy's words returned --
* It will be worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) than for you. Take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' I must go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at once.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took up a purple prayer-book that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had unconsciously
brought in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand from Guy's bed, and walked down-stairs,
without pausing to think what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should say or do, or remem-
bering how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would naturally have shrunk from the sight of
violent grief.

<p/>Philip had retired to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own room the night before, over-
whelmed by the first full view of the extent of the injuries he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had inflicted, the first perception that pride and malevolence had
been the true source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) prejudice and misconceptions, and for
the first time conscious of the long-fostered conceit that had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) bane from boyhood. All had flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with the
discovery of the true purpose of the demand which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought
had justified his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) persecution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw the glory of Guy's
character and tlie part he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had acted, -- the scales of self -admira-
tion fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew both himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sole comfort was in hope for the future, and in devising
how his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) brotherly affection should for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) life testify
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) altered mind, and atone for past ill-will. This alone kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) from being completely crushed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) by no means imagined
how near the end was ; and the physician, ^villing to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)-
self pain, left him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) in hopes, though knowing how it would be.
He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) slept but little, and was very languid in the morning ; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) rose as soon as Arnaud came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>), in order not to occupy
Arnaud's time, as well as to be ready in case Guy should send
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) again, auguring well from hearing that there was nothing



<p/>366 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>stirring above, hoping this was a sign that Guy was asleep. So
hoped the two servants for a long time, but at length, growing
alarmed, after many consultations, they resolved to knock at the
door, and learn what was the state of things.

<p/>Philip likewise was full of anxiety, and coming to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) room-
door to listen for intelligence, it was the ' e morto ' of the passing
Italians that first revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the truth. Guy dead, Amy
widowed, himself the cause -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) who had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would never be
answerable for the death of this young man.

<p/>Truly had Guy's threat, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repent,
been fulfilled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) tottered back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) coucli, and sank down,
in a burst of anguish that swept away all the self-control that
had once been his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) pride. There Amabel found him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stretched,
face downwards, quivering and convulsed by frightful sobs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't -- don't, Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gentle voice. ``Don't
cry so terribly ! '

<p/>Without looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made a gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, as if
to drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) away. ' Don't come here to reproach me ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
muttered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; don't speak so. I want you to hear me ; I have
something for you from him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). If you would only listen, I want
to tell you how happy and comfortable it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took a
chair and sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), relieved on perceiving that the sobs
grew a little less violent.

<p/>' It was very peaceful, very happy,<div class="bookquote">'' repeated she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). ' We ought
to be very glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) turned round, and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for a moment ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
could not bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) quiet face. ' You don't know what
you say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gasped. ' No ; take care of yourself, don't trouble
yourself for such as me ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) desired me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said Amabel. ' You will be happier,
indeed, Philip, if you would only think what glory it is, and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is all safe, and has won the victory, and will have no
more of those hard, hard struggles, and bitter repentance. It
has been such a night, that it seems wrong to be sorry.''

<p/>' Did you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spoke of me again % '

<p/>' Yes ; here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) Prayer-book. Your father gave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant to have told you about it himself, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
not talk yesterday evening, and could not part witli it till '

<p/>Amy broke off by opening the worn purple cover, and showing
the name, in the Archdeacon's writing. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)'s very fond of it,<div class="bookquote">''
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said ; `it is the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) always uses.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-xllas ! she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had not
learnt to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in the past tense.-RRB-

<p/>Philip held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, but the agony of grief returned the
next moment. ' My father, my father ! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have done
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) justice. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had lived, this would never have been 1 '

<p/>' That is over ; you do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) justice now,'' said Amy. ' You did,
indeed you did, make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quite happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said so, again and
again. I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so happy as when you began to get
better. I don't think any one ever had so much happiness ; and

<p/>it never ceased, it was all quiet, and peace, and joy, till it bright-
ened quite into perfect day-- and the angel's song ! Don't you
remember yesterday, how clear and sweet his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) voice came out in
that 1 and it was the last thing almost he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said. I believe ' -- she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice -- ' I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) finislied it among them.''

<p/>The earnest placid voice, speaking thus, in calmness and sim-
plicity, could not fail in soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was so shaken and
exhausted, that she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had great difficulty in restoring him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). After
a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) lay perfectly still on the sofa, and she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sitting by,
relieved by the tranquillity, when there was a knock at the door,
and Arnaud came in, and stood hesitating, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) hardly knew
how to begin. The present fear of agitating her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) charge helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now, when obliged to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts to the subjects on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew Arnaud was come. She (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went to the door, and
spoke low, hoping her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cousin might not hear or understand.

<p/>' How soon must it be ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady, to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)</div>said Arnaud, looking down. ``They
say that so it must be ; and the priest consents to have it in the
churchyard here. The brother of the clergyman is here, and
would know if your ladyship would wish '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said Amabel, reluctant to send such
messages through servants.

<p/>' Let me,'' said Philip, who understood what was going on, and
Avas of course impelled to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) as much as possible.

<p/>' Thank you,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), ' if you are able ! '

<p/>' Oh, yes ; I'll go at once ! '

<p/>' Stop,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was setting forth ; ' you don't know
what you are going to say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head in confusion.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished to be buried here,'' said Amabel, ' and '

<p/>But this renewal of the assurance of the death was too much ;
and covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sank back in another
paroxysm of violent sobs. Amabel could not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Mr. Morris to be so good as to wait, and I will come
directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), then returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) task of comfort till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
again saw Philip lying, with suspended faculties, in the repose
of complete exhaustion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) then went to Mr. Morris, with a look and tone of com-
posure that almost startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) assistance
in the arrangements. The funeral was to be at sunrise the next
day, before the villagers began to keep the feast of St. Michael,
and the rest was to be settled by Arnaud and Mr. Morris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
then said, somewhat reluctantly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) brother had desired to
know whether Lady Morville wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) to-day, and
begged to be sent for ; but Amy plainly perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) thought
it very undesirable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) brother to have any duties to perform
to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) questioned herself whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>)
to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and whether it might be better for Philip ; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought not to ask what might injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) merely
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own comfort ; and, besides, Philip was entirely incapable



<p/>868 THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>of self-command, and it would not be acting fairly to expose him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to the chance of discovering to a stranger, feelings that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would
ordinarily guard so scrupulously.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) therefore gratefully refused the offer, and Mr. Morris very
nearly thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) for doing so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) leave, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must return to lier post ; but first she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) indulged herself
with one brief visit to the room where all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cares and duties
had lately centred. A look -- a thought -- a prayer. The beau-
teous expression there fixed was a help, as it had ever been in
life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went back again cheered and sustained.

<p/>Throughout that day she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) attended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cousin, whose bodily
indisposition required as much care as his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) mind needed soothing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), read to liim, tried to set him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the example of
taking food, took thought for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was the chief sufferer,
as if it was the natural thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to do, working in the
strength her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) who had been
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) chief object of care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had no time to herself, except the
few moments that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) allowed herself now and then to spend in
gazing at the dear face that was still her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) comfort and joy ; until,
at last, late in the evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) succeeded in reading Philip to
sleep. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat in the dim candle-light, with everything
in silence, a sense of desolation came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knew
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>At that moment a carriage thundered at the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
remembered for the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father
and mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) softly left the room and closed the door ; and
finding Anne in the next room, sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Meet mamma, Anne,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); `tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) I am quite well.
Bring them here.''

<p/>They entered ; and there stood Amabel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) face a little
flushed, just like, only calmer, the daughter they had parted
with on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) bridal day, four months ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand
as a sign of silence, and said, --

<p/>' Hush ! don't wake Philip.''

<p/>Mr. Edmonstone was almost angry, and actually began an
impatient exclamation, but broke it off with a sob, caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) arms, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), and then buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) handkerchief.
Mrs. Edmonstone, still aghast at the tidings they had met at
Vicenza, and alarmed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) unnatural composure, embraced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ; held her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) for some moments, then looked anxiously to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) weep. But there was not a tear, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) voice was itself,
though low and weak, as, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) father began pacing up and
down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) repeated, --

<p/>' Pray don't, papa ; Philip has been so ill all day.''

<p/>' Philip -- pshaw ! ' said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily. ' How are
you, yourself, my poor darling ? '

<p/>' Quite well, thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy. ' There is a room ready
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely alarmed, sure that this Avas
a grief too deep for outward tokens, and had no peace till she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 369

<p/>had made Amabel consent to come up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and go at once
to bed. To this she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) agreed, after she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had rung for Arnaud, and
stood with him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) in the corridor, to desire him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) to go at once to
Captain Morville, as softly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) could, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) waked, to
say Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone were come, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
had better not see them to-night ; to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) good night, and hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would sleep quietly.
' And, Arnaud, take care you do not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) know the hour to-
morrow. Perhaps, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) is so tired, he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) may sleep till afterwards.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was very impatient of this colloquy, and
glad when Amabel ended it, and led the way up-stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little room, then quietly opened another door, and
Mrs. Edmonstone found herself standing by the bed, where that
which was mortal lay, with its face bright with the impress of
immortality.

<p/>The shock was great, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was indeed as a son to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fears for Amabel would not leave room for any other
thought.

<p/>' Is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) beautiful 1 ' said Amy, with a smile like his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, my dear, you ought not to be here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Edmonstone, trying to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) away.

<p/>' If you would let me say my prayers here ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), sub-
missively.

<p/>' I think not. I don't know how to refuse, if it would be a
comfort,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, much distressed ; ' but I can't
think it right. The danger is greater after. And surely, my
poor dear child, you have a reason for not risking yourself ! '

<p/>' Go, mamma, I ought not to have brought you here ; I forgot
about infection,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, with the tranquillity which her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
mother had hoped to shake by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) allusion. ' I am coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) took up Guy's watch and a book from the table by the
bed-side, and came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sleeping-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wound up the
watch, and then allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother to undress her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), answering
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) inquiries about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) health in a gentle, indifferent, matter-
of-fact way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) said little of Guy, but that little was without
agitation, and in due time she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lay down in bed. Still, whenever
Mrs. Edmonstone looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), there was no sleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes,
and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), on the plea that
being watched made her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) more wakeful, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did not like to
see mamma sitting up.

<p/>Almost as soon as it was light, Mrs. Edmonstone returned,
and was positively frightened ; for there stood Amabel, dressed
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) white muslin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) white bonnet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) deep lace wedding-
veil. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) glossy hair was hidden away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) face was
placid as ever, though there was a red spot on each cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
sa.w her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother's alarm, and reassured her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) by speaking calmly.

<p/>' You know I have nothing else but colours ; I should like to
wear this, if you will let me.''

<p/>' But, dearest, you must not -- cannot go.''

<p/>' It is very near. We often walked there together. I would

<p/>not ir I thought it would hurt me ; but I wish it very much
indeed. At home by Michaehnas ! '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone yielded, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mind misgave her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), com-
forted by hoping for the much-desired tears. But Amabel, wlio
used to cry so easily for a trifle, had now not a tear. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) grief
was as yet too deep, or perhaps more truly sorrow and mourning
had not begun while the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband's spirit was
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) still.

<p/>It was time to set forth, and the small party of mourners met
in the long corridor. Mr. Edmonstone would have given his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
daughter his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) arm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said --

<p/>' I beg your pardon, dear papa, I don't think I can ; ' and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
walked alone and firmly.

<p/>It was a strange sight that English funeral, so far from Eng-
land. The bearers were Italian peasants. There was a sheet
thrown over the cofiin instead of a pall, and this, with the white
dress of the young widow, gave the effect of the emblematic
whiteness of a child's funeral ; and the impression was heightened
by the floating curling white clouds of vapour rising in strange
shrouded shadowy forms, like spirit mourners, from the narrow
ra^dnes round the grave-yard, and the snowy mountains shining
in the morning light against tlie sky.

<p/>Gliding almost like one of those white wreaths of mist, Amabel
walked alone, tearless and calm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) head bent down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
long veil falling round her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in full light folds, as when it had
caught the purple light on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wedding-day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) parents were
close behind, weeping more for the living than the dead, though
Guy had a fast hold of their hearts ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own mother could
scarce have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) better than Mrs. Edmonstone did. Lastly,
v>`ere Anne and Arnaud, sincere mourners, especially Arnaud,
who had loved and cherished his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) young master from childhood.

<p/>They went to the stranger's corner of the grave-yard, for of
course the church did not open to a member of another com-
munion of the visible church ; but around them were the hills
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had read many a meaning, and which had echoed a
response to his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) last chant with the promise of the blessing of peace.

<p/>The blessing of peace came in the precious English burial-
service, as they laid him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) to rest in the earth, beneath the spread-
ing chestnut-tree, rendered a home by those words of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) Mother
Church -- the mother who had guided each of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) steps in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
orphaned life. It was a distant grave, far from his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) home and
kindred, but in a hallowed spot, and a most fair one ; and there
might his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) mortal frame meetly rest till the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) should
rise, while from their ancestral tombs should likewise awaken
the forefathers whose sins Avere indeed visited on him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>)
early death ; but, thanks to Him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) who giveth tlie victory, in
death without the sting.

<p/>Amabel, in obedience to a sign from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother, sat on a root
of the tree while tlie Lesson was read, and afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) moved
forward and stood at the edge of the grave, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) Iiands tightly



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 371

<p/>clasped, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) head somewhat raised, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) spirit was
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) repose above, rather than to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
earthly resting-place.

<p/>The service was ended, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was taking a last long gaze,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother, in the utmost anxiety, was striving to make
up her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mind to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) away, when suddenly a tall gaunt
figure was among them -- his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face ghastly pale, and full of despair
and bewilderment -- his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) step uncertain -- his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dress disordered,

<p/>Amabel turned, went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm,
and said, softly, and quietly looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face, ' It is over
now, Philip ; you had better come home.''

<p/>Not attempting to withstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) obeyed as if it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
only instinct. It was like some vision of a guiding, succouring
spirit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) moved on, slowly gliding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) white draperies.
Mrs. Edmonstone watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) in unspeakable awe and amaze-
ment, almost overpowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) anxieties. It seemed as impos-
sible that the one should be Amy as that the other should be
Philip ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gentle little clinging daughter, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) proud, imper •
turbable, self-reliant nephew.

<p/>But it was Amy's own face, when they entered the corridor
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) turned back her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) veil, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) flushed and heated
cheeks, at the same time opening Philip's door and saying,
' Now you must rest, for you ought not to have come out. Lie
down, and let mamma read to you.''

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant, but Amy looked up earnestly
and said, ' Yes, dear mamma, I should like to be alone a little
while.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) then conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) father to the sitting-rooni up-stairs,

<p/>' I will give you the papers,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said ; and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), re-
turned immediately.

<p/>' This is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. ' You will tell me if there is any-
thing I must do at once. Here is a letter to Mr. Markham,
and another to Mr. Dixon, if you will be so kind as to write
and enclose them. Thank you, dear papa.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) drew a blotting-book towards him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), saw that there was
ink and pen, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) too much appalled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ways to say
anything.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) task was less hard than the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother.
Strong excitement had carried Philip to the grave-yard as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) learnt what was passing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could hardly return even
with Arnaud's support, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had only just reached the sofa
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fell into a fainting-fit.

<p/>It was long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) gave any sign of returning life, and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes and saw Mrs. Edmonstone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) closed them
almost immediately, as if unable to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) look. It was
easier to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) swoon than afterwards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew
nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) repentance and confession ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) confidence, led Laura to act insincerely, and
been the cause of Guy's death. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not know how bitterly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) accused himself, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not but see he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was

<p/>B B 2



<p/>372 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>miserable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could by no means fathom his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wretchedness, nor
guess that her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) very presence made him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) conscious how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was fallen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so ill that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not manifest her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) dis-
pleasure, nor show anything but solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) relief ; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) kindness was entirely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) condition, not to himself ; and
perceiving this, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confession had been re-
ceived, greatly aggravated his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) distress, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) owned within
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) well deserved it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was in no state for being read to ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
completely exhausted, and suffering from violent headache. So
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could conscientiously say that to be left quiet was the
best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) daughter.

<p/>Amabel was lying on lier bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) Bible open by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; not
exactly reading, but as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was now and then finding a verse
and dwelling on it. Gentle and serene she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked ; but would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) never weep ? would those quiet blue eyes be always sleepless
and tearless ?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) asked anxiously for Philip, and throughout the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
seemed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not try to get up and go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was continually begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother to see about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).
It was a harassing day for poor Mrs. Edmonstone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would
have been glad to have sat by Amabel all tlie time, writing to
Charles, or hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) talk. Amy had much to say, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
wished to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother share the perfect peace and thank-
fulness that had been breathed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) during those last hours
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) liked to tell the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
illness and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) precious sayings, to one who would treasure them
almost like herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face turned away, so as
not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother's tears, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mild voice unwavering, as
if secure in the happiness of these recollections. This was the
only comfort of Mrs. Edmonstone's day ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) lieard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) Imsband's boots creaking in the corridor, it was a sure sign
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was in some jDerplexity, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) must go and help
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to write a letter, or make some arrangement. Philip, too,
needed attention ; but excellent nurse as Mrs. Edmonstone was,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) only made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) worse. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt slie was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) kind
aunt still, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw how lie had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) pardon was an effort. The fond, spontaneous, unreserved
affection -- almost petting -- which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had well-nigli dared to con-
temn, was gone ; her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) manner was only that of a considerate
nurse. Mucli as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) longed for a word of Laura, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not dare
to lead to it, -- indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was so far from speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) of any
subject which touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not presume even to
inquire for Amabel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) through Arnaud.

<p/>At night sheer exhaustion worked its own cure ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) slept
soundly, and awoke in tlie morning revived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) heard from
Arnaud that Lady Morville was pretty well, but had not slept ;
and presently JNIrs. Edmonstone came in and took pains to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) comfortal^le, but with an involuntary dryness of manner.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) uncle would come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 373

<p/>up, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) felt equal to talking over some business. Philip's brain
reeled with dismay and consternation, for it flashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was heir of Itedclyfie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must profit by the death lie had
caused ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had slain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must take possession of the lands
which, with loathing and horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
almost coveted. Nothing more was wanting. There was little
consolation in remembering that the inheritance would clear
away all difficulties in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had sinned ;
wealth did not alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fault, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spirit could not l-RRB-rook that
if spurned in poverty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should be received for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) riclies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
honoured his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt for being cold and reserved, and could not
bear the idea of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle ready to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) half-way.

<p/>After the first shock he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) became anxious to have the meeting
over, know the worst, and hear on what ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stood with
Laura. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was dressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sent a message to announce
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was ready, and lay on the sofa awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle's arrival,
as patiently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could. Mr. Edmonstone, meantime, was screw-
ing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) courage -- not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) meant to say a word of Laura,
-- Philip was too unwell to be told his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but now
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had ceased to rely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) nephew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began to dread him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) overbearing ways ; and besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a joerfect horror of
witnessing agitation.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came, and PhilijD rose to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with a feeling of
shame and inferiority most new to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't, don't, I beg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Edmonstone, with what was
meant for dignity, ' Lie still ; you had much better. My stars !
how ill you look ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) exclaimed, startled by Philip's altered face
and figure. ' You have had a sharpish touch ; but you are
better, eh ? '

<p/>' Yes, thank you.''

<p/>' Well ; I thought I had better come and speak to you, if you
felt up to it. Here is -- here is -- I hope it is all right and legal ;
but that you can tell better than I ; and you are concerned in it
anyhow. Here is poor Guy's will, which we thought you had
better look over, if you liked, and felt equal, eh ? '

<p/>' Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand ; but Mr. Ed-
monstone withheld it, trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) patience by an endless quantity
of discursive half -sentences, apparently Avitliout connection with
each other, about disaiDpointment, and hopes, and being sorry,
and prospects, and its ' being an unj^leasant thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>and ' best
not raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Ed</b></font>) expectations : ' during all which time Philip, expect-
ing to hear of Laura, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) heart beating so fast as to renew
tlie sensation of faintness, waited in vain, and strove to gather
the meaning, and find out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was forgiven, almost doubt-
ing whether the confusion was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own mind or in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle's
words. However, at last the meaning bolted out in one compre-
hensive sentence, when Mr. Edmonstone thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had suffi-
ciently prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) disappointment, -- ' Poor Amy is to
be confined in the spring.''

<p/>There Mr. Edmonstone stopped short, very much afraid of the



<p/>374 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>effect ; but Philip raised himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face brightened, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was greatly relieved, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) Jieart he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exclaimed, ' Thank
Heaven ! '

<p/>' That's right ! that is very well said ! * answered Mr. Edmon-
stone, very much pleased. ' It would be a pity it should go out
of the old line after all ; and it's a very generous thing in you to
say so.''

<p/>' Oh no ! ' said Philip, shrinking into himself at even such
praise as this.

<p/>' Well, well,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle, ' you will see he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has thought of you,
be it how it may. There ! I only hope it is right ; though it
does seem rather queer, appointing poor little Amy executor
rather than me. If I had but been here in time ! But `tAvas

<p/>Heaven's will ; and so • It does not signify, after all, if it is

<p/>not quite formal. We understand each other.

<p/>The will was on a sheet of letter-paper, in Arnaud's stiff French
handwriting ; it was witnessed by the two Mr. -RSB-\Iorrises, and
signed on the 27th of September, in very frail and feeble charac-
ters. Amabel and Markham were the executors, and Amabel
was to be sole guardian, in case of the birth of a child. If it was
a son, #10,000 was left to Philip himself ; if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was to have
all the plate, furniture, tfec, of Redclyffe, with the exception of
whatever Lady Morville might choose for herself.

<p/>Philip scarcely regarded the legacy -LRB-though it smoothed away
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) chief difficulties-RRB- as more than another of those ill-requited
benefits which were weighing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to the earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) read on to a
sentence which reproached him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so acutely, tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would willingly
have hidden from it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had done from Guy's countenance.
It was the bequest of #5000 to Elizabeth Well wood. Sebastian
Dixon's debts were to be paid off; #1000 was left to Marianne
Dixon, and the rest of the personal property was to be
Amabel's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) gave back the paper, with only the words ' Thank you.*
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did not feel as if it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to speak ; and Mr. Edmon-
stone hesitated, made an attempt at congratulating him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>), broke
down, and asked if it was properly drawn up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) glanced at the beginning and end, said it was quite correct,
and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) head down, as if the examination had been a great
deal of trouble.

<p/>' And what do you think of Amy's being under age ? * fidgeted
on Mr. Edmonstone. ' How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to act, poor dear I Shall I
act for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) V

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will soon be of age,'' said Philip, wearily.

<p/>* In January, poor darling. Who would have thought ho^^ it
would have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ? I little thought, last May -- but,
holloa ! what have I been at ? ' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), jumping up in a great
fright, as Philip, so weak as to be overcome by the least agita-
tion, changed countenance, covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands, and
turned away with a suppressed sob. ' I didn't mean it, I am
sure ! Here ! mamma ! '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 375

<p/>' No, no,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, recovering, and sitting up ; ' don't call
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I beg. There is nothing the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Edmonstone obeyed ; but lie was too much afraid of
causing a renewal of agitation to continue the conversation ; and
after walking about the room a little while, and shaking it more
than Philip could well bear, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went away to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letters.

<p/>In the meantime, Amabel had been -.spending her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) morning in
the same quiet way as the former day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wrote part of a letter
to Laura, and walked to the graveyard, rather against her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's
wish ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was so good and obedient, it was impossible to
thwart her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), though Mrs. Edmonstone was surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) pro-
posal to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) father and Philip at tea. ' Do you like it, my
dear?''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told me to take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),'' said Amabel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) deserves you should worry yourself
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone. ' If you knew all '

<p/>' I do know all, mamma,-- if you mean about Laura. Surely
you must forgive. Think how he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) repents. What, have you not
liad his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) letter ? Then how did you know V

<p/>' I learned it from Laura herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) trouble at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) illness
revealed it. Do you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has written ? '

<p/>' Yes, mamma ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told Guy all about it, and was very sorry,
and wrote as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was able. Guy sent you a long message.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so anxious about it.''

<p/>Amabel showed more eagerness to understand the state of the
case, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had about anything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) urged that Philij-RRB-
should be spoken to, as soon as possible, saying the suspense
must be grievous, and dwelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repentance. Mrs. Edmon-
stone promised to speak to papa, and this satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) resolution of meeting Philip that evening, looking on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as a charge left her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) husband, and conscious that, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) alone understood how deep was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sorrow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) could make
the time spent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) parents less embarrassing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) presence always soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>)
father quiet ; so that the evening passed off very well. Mrs.
Edmonstone waited on both ; and, in Amy's presence, was better
able to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) usual manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) nephew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
sat wondering at the placidity of Amy's pale face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair was
smoothed back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wore a cap, -- the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) long shady
curls helping to mark the change from the bright days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
girlhood ; but the mournfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) countenance did not mar
the purity and serenity that had always been its great character-
istic ; and in the faint sweet smile with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) received a
kind word or attention, there was a likeness to that peculiar and
beautiful expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's, so as, in spite of the great
difference of feature and colouring, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) a resemblance
to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>All this day had been spent by Mr. Edmonstone in a fret to
get away from Recoara, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife was hardly less desirous to
leave it than himself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could have no peace or comfort



<p/>376 THE' HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>about Amabel, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) safely at home. Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) dreaded
proposing the departure, and even more the departure itself ;
and, in spite of Mr. Edmonstone's impatience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) alone
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mourning ; but when, after two days of hard
work, Anne had nearly managed to complete it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
mind to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daughter that they ought to set out.

<p/>Amabel replied by mentioning Philip. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) deemed liim a sort
of trust, and had been reposing in the thought of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a
reason for lingering in the scene where the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) life
had departed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). Mrs. Edmonstone would not allow that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ought to remain for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sake, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) duty to
resolve to leave the place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said, ' Yes, but for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; ' and it
ended in Mrs. Edmonstone going, without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), to inform
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought Amy ought to be at home as soon as pos-
sible ; but that it was difficult to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as yet not well enough to be left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was, of course,
shocked at being thus considered, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) next saw
Amabel, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), with great earnestness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) remaining there on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) account ; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was almost
well, and meant to leave Recoara very soon ; the journey was
very easy ; the sea voyage would be the best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should be glad to get to the regimental doctor at Corfu.

<p/>AmalDcl sighed, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ought to be convinced. The very
pain it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to lose sight of that green grave, the chestnut-
tree, and the white mountain ; to leave the rooms and passages
which still, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ears, were haunted by Guy's hushed step and
voice, and to part with the window where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) used each wakeful
night to retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) profile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had stood pausing before telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exceeding happiness ; that very pain made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) think
that opposition would be selfish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) must go some time or
other, and it was foolish to defer the struggle ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) must not
detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) parents in an infected place, nor keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother
from Charles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) therefore consented, and let them do what
they pleased, -- only insisting on Arnaud's being left with Philip.

<p/>Philip did not think this necessary, but yielded, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
urged it as a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own mind ; and Arnaud, though
unwilling, and used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own way, could make no objection
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) asked it as a personal favour. Arnaud was,- at his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own
earnest wish, to continue in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ser\dce ; and, as soon as Philip
was able ta-embark, was to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to Holly well.

<p/>All this oime nothing passed about Laura. Amabel asked
several times whether papa had spoken, but was always answered,
' Not yet ; ' and at last Mrs. Edmonstone, after vainly trying to
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), was obliged to give it up. The truth was, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) could
not begin ; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) nephew, and so unused to assume
superiority over him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not know what to do, and found
all kinds of reasons for avoiding the embarrassing scene. Since
Philip still must be dealt with cautiously, better not enter on
the subject at all. When reminded that the suspense was worse
than anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said, no one could tell how things would turn



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 377

<p/>out, and grew angry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wife for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to make up
a shameful affair like that, when poor Guy had not been dead a
week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been the death of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ; but it was just like
mamma, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) always spoilt him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had a great mind to vow
never to consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) daughter's marrying such an overbearing,
pragmatical fellow ; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ought to be ashamed of even thinking
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was no better than her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother's murderer.

<p/>After this tirade, Mrs. Edmonstone might well feel obliged to
tell Amabel, that papa must not be pressed any further ; and, of
course, if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would not speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could not -LRB-nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) wisli it-RRB-.

<p/>' Then, mamma,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, with the air of decision that had
lately grown on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), ' I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
added, imploringly ; ' but indeed I must. It is hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) not
to hear that you had not his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) letter, and that Laura has told. I
know Guy would wish me, so don't be displeased, dear mamma.''

<p/>' I can't be displeased with anything you do.''

<p/>' And you give me leave ? '

<p/>' To be sure I do, -- leave to do anything but hurt yourself.''

<p/>' And would it be wrong for me to offer to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? No
one else will, and it will be sad for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not to hear. It cannot
be wrong, can it?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), as the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) right hand
squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wedding-ring, a habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had taken up of late.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not, my poor darling. Do just as you think fit.
I am sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>), for I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) is in great trouble, and I

must not ask me to do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morris</b></font>) has disapjDointed me too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Edmonstone left the room in tears.

<p/>Amabel went up to the window, looked long at the chestnut-
tree, then up into the sky, sat down, and leant her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) forehead on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand in meditation, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) rose up, cheered and sustained,
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had been holding council with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not over-estimate Philip's sufferings from suspense and
anxiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not heard a word of Laura ; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had borne
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) illness, nor how much displeasure his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) confession had brought
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) learn what hope there was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
repentance was accepted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did not venture to ask ; for after
engaging to leave all to them, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) intrude his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own concerns
on them at such a time ? It was but a twelvemonth since he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had saddened and shadowed Guy's short life and love with the
very suffering from uncertainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found so hard to bear.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) remembered this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had a sort of fierce satisfaction in
enduring this retributive justice ; though there were moods when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt the torture so acutely, that it seemed to liim as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
brain would turn if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw them depart, and was left behind to
this distracting doubt.

<p/>The day had come, on which they were to take their first stage,
as far as Vicenza, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) last hopes were fading. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tried to
lose the sense of misery by bestirring himself in the preparations ;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was too weak, and Mrs. Edmonstone, insisting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
attempting no more, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own sitting-room.



<p/>378 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/>Presently there was a knock, and in came Amabel, dressed, for
the first time, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) weeds, tlie blackness and width of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
sweeping crape making her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) young face look smaller and paler,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) held in lier Iiand some leaves of chestnut, that showed
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had been. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) smiled a little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) came in, saying,
' I am come to you for a little quiet, out of the bustle of packing
up. I want you to do something for me.''

<p/>' Anything for you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what you will like to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), with that smile, `for
it is more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) than for me. Could you, without teasing
yourself, put that into Latin for me, by and by? I think it
should be in Latin, as it is in a foreign country.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) a paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own writing.

<p/>GUY MORVILLE,

<p/>OF EEDCLYFFE, ENGLAND.

<p/>DIED THE EVE OP ST. MICHAEL AND ALL ANGELS, 18--

<p/>AGED 21^.

<p/>I BELIEVE IN THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS.

<p/>' Will you be so kind as to give it to Arnaud when it is done ? '
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) continued ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) will send it to the man who is making the
cross. I think the kind people here will respect it.''

<p/>' Yes,'' said Philip, ' it is soon done, and thank you for letting me
do it. But, Amy, I would not alter your choice ; yet there is one
that seems to me more applicable, <div class="bookquote">``Greater love hath no man '''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I know what you mean,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy ; ' but that has so higli
a meaning that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear it to be applied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Or ratlier, what right have I to quote it?'' said Philip, bitterly.
``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend! No, Amy; you should rather choose, <div class="bookquote">``If thine
enemy thirst, give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drink ; for in so doing thou shalt heap
coals of fire on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>I am sure they are burning on mine,''
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>' Don't say such things. We both know that, at the worst
of times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked on you as a sincere friend.''

<p/>Philip groaned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought it best to go on to something
else. ' I like this best,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said. ' It will be nice to think of
far away. I should like, too, for these Italians to see the
stranger has the same creed as themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>After a moment's pause, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked at the paper,
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said, ' Amy, I have one thing to ask of you. Will you write
my name in the Prayer-book ? '

<p/>' That I will,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and Philip drew it from under the sofa
cushion, and began putting together his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pocket gold pen. While
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was doing this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, ' Will you write to me sometimes ?
I shall be so anxious to know how you get on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes, thank you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), with a sigh, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would fain
have said more.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 379

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) paused ; then said, abruptly, ' Do you know they never
liad your letter ? '

<p/>' Ha ! Good heavens ! ' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), starting up in consternation ;
' then they don't know it ! '

<p/>' They do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I wanted to tell you
about it. They know it. Poor Laura was so unhappy when
you were ill, that mamma made it out from Jier.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) obeyed the hand that invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seat, and
turned hie face earnestly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) must let her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) be his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
comforter, though a moment before his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind would have revolted
at troubling the newly-made widow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) love affairs. Amabel
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), as fully and clearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could, how the truth had
come out, how gently Laura had been dealt with, how Charles
had been trying to soften his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father, and papa had not said one
angry word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>' They forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Oh, Amy, thanks indeed ! You have
taken away one of the heaviest burdens. I am glad, indeed,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke first. For my own part, I see through all their
kindness and consideration how they regard me.''

<p/>' They know how sorry you are, and that you wrote to tell
all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel. ' They forgive, indeed they do ; but they
cannot bear to speak about it just yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' If you forgive. Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), in a husky voice, ' I may hope
for pardon from any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Hush ! don't say tliat. You have been so kind, all this time,
and we have felt together so much, that no one could help for-
getting anything that went before. Then you will write to me ;
and will you tell me how to direct to you 1 '

<p/>' You will write to me 1 ' cried Philip, brightening for a mo-
ment with glad surprise. ' Oh, Amy, you will quite overpower
me with your goodness ! -- The coals of fire,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) finished, sinking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) voice, and again pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) brow.

<p/>' You must not speak so, Philip ; ' then looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), ' Is
your head aching ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so much aching as -- ' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused, and exclaimed, as if
carried away in spite of himself, `almost bursting with the
thoughts of -- of you. Amy, -- of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whom I knew too late, --
wilfully misunderstood, envied, persecuted ; who, -- oh ! Amy,
Amy, if you could guess at the anguish of but one of my
thoughts, you would know what the first murderer meant when
he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said, ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My punishment is greater than I can bear.'' '

<p/>' I can't say don't think,'' said Amy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sweet, calm tone ;
' for I have seen how happy repentance made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but I know
it must be dreadful. I suppose the worse it is at the time, the
better it must be afterwards. And I am sure this Prayer-book '
-- she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand on it all the time, as if it was a pleasure
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to touch it again -- ' must be a comfort to you. Did you
not see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) made me give it to you to use that day, when,
if ever, there was pardon and peace -- '

<p/>' I remember,'' said Philip, in a low, grave, heartfelt tone ; and



<p/>380 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) took the pen, and was writing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) name below the old
inscription, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added, ' And the date, Amy, and -- yes,'' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) write ``From G. M.''-- `but put from A. F. M. too. Thank
you ! One thing more ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hesitated, and spoke very low,
``You must write in it what you said when you came to fetch
me that day, -- <div class="bookquote">'' A broken ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>' --

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) finished writing, Mrs. Edmonstone came in. ' jVIy
Amy, all is ready. We must go. Good-bye, Philip,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>),
in the tone of one so eager for departure as to fancy farewells
would hasten it. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not more eager than Mr.
Edmonstone, who rushed in to hurry them off, shaking hands
cordially with Philip, and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to make haste and recover
liis good looks. Amabel held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would fain
liave said something cheering, but the power failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). A deep
colour came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cheeks ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thick black veil over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) face, and turned away.

<p/>PhilijD came down-stairs with them, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) enter the carriage
followed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother, Mr. Edmonstone outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) remem-
bered the gay smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) last saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) seated in that
carriage, and the active figure that had sprung after her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
tliought of the kind bright eyes that had pleaded with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) for
the last time, and recollected the suspicions and the pride with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had plumed himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) rejection, and thrown away
the last chance.

<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ever see Amabel again ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) groaned and went
back to the deserted rooms.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXYII

<p/>And see
If aught of sprightly, fresh, or free.
With tl>e calm sweetness may compare
Of the pale form half slumbering there.
Therefore this one dear couch about
We linger hour by hour :
The love that each to each we bear,
All treasures of enduring care,

<p/>Into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lap we pour.-- Lyra Innocentium

<p/>The brother and sisters, left at home together, liad been a very
sad and silent party, unable to attempt comforting each other.
Charlotte's grief was wild and ungovernable ; breaking out into
fits of sobbing, and attending to nothing till slie was abashed
first by a reproof from -RSB-\Ir. Ross, and next by the description
of Amabel's conduct ; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) grew ashamed and set herself
to atone, by double care, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) neglect of Charles's comforts.

<p/>Charles, however, wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had rather be let
alone. After one exclamation of, ' My poor Amy ! ' lie said not
a word of lamentation, but lay hour after hour without speaking,
dwelling on the happy days he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had spent with Guy, -- companion,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 381

<p/>friend, brother, -- ^the first beam that had brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) existence,
and taught him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to make it no longer cheerless ; musing on the
brilliant promise that had been cut off ; remembering his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hopes
for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) most beloved sister, and feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sorrow with imagining
hers. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) first grief, and a very deep one. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed to
have no comfort but in Mr. Ross, who contrived to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
every day, and would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) how fully he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) affection
and admiration for Guy, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had marvelled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) whole
character, as it had shown itself more especially at the time of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) marriage, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) chastened temper had been the more
remarkable in so young a man, with the world opening on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
so brightly. As to the promise lost, that, indeed, Mr. Ross
owned, and pleased Charles by saying how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had hoped to watch
its fulfilment ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) spoke of its having been, in truth, no blight,
only that those fair blossoms were removed where nothing could
check their full development or mar their beauty. ' The hope in
earthly furrows sown, would rijDen in the sky ; ' Charles groaned,
saying it was hard not to see it, and they might speak as they
would, but that would not comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) in thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister.
What was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sorrow to hers ? But Mr. Ross had strong trust
in Amabel's depth and calm resignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) said her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sjDirit of
yielding would support her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), that as in drowning or falling,
struggling is fatal, when quietness saves, so it would be with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) : and that even in this greatest of all trials she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would rise
instead of being crushed, with all that v,^as good and beautiful
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) purified and refined. Charles heard, strove to believe
and be consoled, and brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letters, trying, Avith voice
breaking down, to show Mr. Ross how truly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had judged of
Amy, then listened with a kind of pleasure to the reports of the
homely but touching laments of all the village.

<p/>Laura did not, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother and sister, seek for consolation
from Mr. Ross or Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way, saying little,
fulfilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) household cares, writing all the letters tliat nobody
else would write, providing for Charles's ease, and looking
thoroughly cast down and wretched, but saying nothing ; con-
scious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother and sister did not believe lier affection
for Guy equal to theirs ; and Charles was too much dejected, and
too much displeased with Philip, to try to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>It was a relief to hear, at length, that the travellers had landed,
and would be at home in the evening ; not till late, wrote Mrs.
Edmonstone, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thought it best for Amabel to go at
once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) OAvn old room, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) particularly wished
not to be moved from it.

<p/>The evening had long closed in ; poor Bustle had been shut
up in Charlotte's room, and the three sat together round the fire,
unable to guess how they should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and tliinking how
they had lately been looking forward to greeting their bride, as
they used proudly to call her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). Charles dwelt on that talk on the
green, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ' when shall we three meet again 1 ' and spoke not
a word ; Laura tried to read ; and Charlotte heard false alarms



<p/>382 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>of wheels ; but all were so still, that when the wheels really came,
they were heard all down the turnpike road, and along the lane,
before they sounded on the gravel drive,

<p/>Laura and Charlotte ran into the hall ; Charles reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
crutches, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands shook so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not adjust
them, and was obliged to sit down, rising the next minute as the
black figures entered together. Amy's sweet face Avas pressed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but neither spoke. That agitated ' My dear, dear Charlie ! '
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) mother's, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) threwher arms around him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>), with redoubled
kisses and streaming tears ; and there was a trembling tone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>)
father's ' Well, Charlie boy, how have you got on without us 1 '

<p/>They sat down, Charles with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and holding
a hand steadier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own, but hot and feverisli to the touch.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) leant forward to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face, and, as if in answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
turned it on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). It was the old face, paler and thinner, and
the eyelids had a hard reddened look, from want of sleep : but
Charles, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother at first, was almost awed by the melan-
choly serenity of the expression. ' Ha^^e you been quite well 1 '
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked, in a voice which sounded strangely familiar, in its
fond, low tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause, followed by an interchange of question and
answer between the others, on the journey, and on various little
home circumstances. Presently Mrs. Edmonstone said Amy had
better come up-stairs.

<p/>• I have not seen Bustle,'' said Amy, looking at Charlotte.

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is in my room,'' faltered Charlotte.

<p/>' I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).''

<p/>Charlotte hastened away, glad to wipe her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) tears when outside
the door. Poor Bustle had been watching for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) master ever
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) departure, and hearing the sounds of arrival, was wild
to escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) prison. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) rushed out the moment the door
was open, and was scratching to be let into the drawing-room
before Charlotte could come up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dashed in, laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head on Amabel's knee, and wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tail for welcome ;
gave the same greeting to IVIr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, but only
for a moment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ran restlessly seeking round the room, came
to the door, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wistful looks made Charlotte let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) out.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and dropping on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) knees as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
outside, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) forehead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) glossy black head, wliispered
that it was of no use, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would never come back. The dog burst
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and the next moment was smelling and wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) tail
at a portmanteau, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
could hardly refrain from a great outburst of sobbing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
thought what joy its arrival had hitherto been.

<p/>Suddenly Bustle bounded away, and as Charlotte stood trying
to compose herself enough to ceturn to tlie drawing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
heard the poor fellow whining to be let in at Guy's bed-room door.
At the same time the drawing-room door opened, and anxious
that Amy should neither see nor hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 383

<p/>admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and shut herself in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the dark, where,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) long silky curls, and sitting on the ground,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sobbed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) caresses.

<p/>Amabel meantime returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) room, and looked round on
its well-known aspect with a sad smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought of the
prater with whicli she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had quitted it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bridal day, and did
not feel as if it had been unanswered ; for surely the hand of
a Father had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) great
affliction.

<p/>Tliough she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was very well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) go
to bed at once, and Laura attended on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) with a sort of fright-
ened, respectful tenderness, hardly able to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looks of
gratitude. The first time the two sisters were alone, Amabel
said, <div class="bookquote">``Philip is much better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura, who was settling some things on the table, started
back and coloured, then, unable to resist the desire of hearing
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), looked earnestly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is gone to Corfu,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Amabel. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only kept

at Geneva, saying his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) strength had improved wonderfully. Will

at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) face, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) vainly tried to keep in order. ' Dearest,
I have been very sorry for you, and so has Guy.''

<p/>' Amy ! ' and Laura found herself giving way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tears, in
spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) previous exhortations to Charlotte, about self-
control ; ' my own, own sister ! ' To have Amy at home was an
unspeakable comfort.

<p/>' Papa and mamma were both as kind as possible to Philip,<div class="bookquote">''
continued Amabel ; ' but they could not bear to enter on that.
So I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) you had told all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was very glad.''

<p/>' Oh, no ! he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was glad ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said it was a great relief ; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
was very anxious about you, Laura. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been so kind to
me,'' said Amabel, so earnestly, that Laura received another

reading, ' I have continued to gain strength since you went ; so
that there is no further need of detaining Arnaud. I have twice
been out of doors, and am convinced that I am equal to the

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head on the pillow as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had done with the
subject, and Laura did not venture to pursue it, but went down
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone was feeling it a great comfort to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
son to talk to again, and availed herself of it to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) of
Philip, while Laura was absent, and then to return to speak of
Amy on Laura's re-entrance. vShe said, all through the journey,
Amy had been as passive and tranquil as possible, chiefly lean-
ing back in the carriage in silence, excepting that when they
finally left the view of the snowy mountains, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) gazed after
them as long as the least faint cloud-like summit was visible.
Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not sleep, except that now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dozed a
little in the carriage, but at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heard every hour strike
in turn, and lay awake through all, nor had she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) shed one tear
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) mother had joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Mrs. Edmonstone's anxiety
was very great, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew Amy must pay for that
unnatural calmness, and the longer it was before it broke down,
the worse it would be for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was at home, that
was one thing to be thankful for, and happen what might, it
could not be as distressing as if it had been abroad.

<p/>Another night of ' calm unrest,'' and Amabel rose in the morn-
ing, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) usual hour, to put on the garments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) widowhood,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had last stood as a bride. Charles was actually
startled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) entering the dressing-room, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) used to
do, before breakfast, to read with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) voice was as
steady as ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) breakfasted with the family, and came up
afterwards with Laura to unpack her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) dressing-case, and take
out the little treasures that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) husband had enjoyed
buying in the continental towns, as presents for the home party.

<p/>All this, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had previously prepared herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
underwent as quietly as possible ; but something unexpected
came on her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>). Charlotte, trying to pet and comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in every
possible way, brought in all the best flowers still lingering in
the garden, and among them a last blossom of the Noisette rose,
the same of which Guy had been twisting a spray, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
first told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) love.

<p/>It was too much. It recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) perfect health and vigour,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) light activity, and enjoyment of life, and something came on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) of the sensation we feel for an insect, one moment full of
joyous vitality, the next, crushed and still. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had hitherto
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) feverish thirst and fainting weariness being at
rest, and felt the relief, or else followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spirit to its repose,
and rejoiced ; but now the whole scene brought back what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
once was ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) youthful, agile frame, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) eyes dancing in light, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
bounding step, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) gay whistle, the strong hand that had upheld
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) on the precipice, the sure foot that had carried aid to the
drowning sailors, the arm that was to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) stay for life,
all came on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in contrast with -- death ! The thought swept
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), carrying away every other, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) burst into tears.

<p/>The tears would have their course ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not restrain



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 385

<p/>them when once they began, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) struggles to check them
only brought an increase of them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sobs grew so violent
that Laura, much alarmed, made a sign to Charlotte to fetch
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother ; and Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in haste, found it
was indeed the beginning of a frightful hysterical attack. The
bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firm-
ness and com^DOsure, and now nature asserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) rights ; the
hysterics returned again and again, and when it seemed as if
exhaustion had at length produced quiet, the opening of a door,
or a sound in the distance, would renew all again.

<p/>It was not till night had closed in that Mrs. Edmonstone was
at all satisfied about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and had at length the comfort of seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fall into a sound deep sleep ; such an unbroken dreamless
sleep as had scarcely visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) first went to Kecoara.
Even this sleep did not restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) became very unwell,
and both Dr. Mayerne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mother insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) avoiding
the least exertion or agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was quite submissive, only
begging earnestly to be allowed to see Mr. Ross, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) knew
it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) good rather than harm, and promising to let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) the instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) found it too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ; and
though Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid, they agreed
that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was so reasonable and docile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ought to be allowed
to judge for herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) begged that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) might come after church on All Saints'
day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) came, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) first greeting of peace, Mrs. Edmon-
stone signed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) to read at once, instead of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmon</b></font>).
The beautiful lesson for the day overcame Mrs. Edmonstone so
much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was obliged to go out of Amabel's sight ; but as
the words were read. Amy's face recovered once more the serenity
that had been swept away by the sight of the flowers. Peace
had returned, and when the calm every-day words of the service
were over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hand to Mr. Ross, and said, ' Thank
you, that was very nice. Now talk to me.''

<p/>It was a difficult request, but Mr. Ross understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and
talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sought, in a gentle, deep, liigh strain of hope
and faith, very calm and soothing, and with a fatherly kindness
that was very pleasant from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) who had baptized her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), taught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had last seen blessing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband.
It ended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looking up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) when it was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to
go, and saying, ' Thank you. You will come again when you
have time, I hope. My love to dear Mary, I sliould like to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) soon, but I knew you would do me more good than anybody,
and know better how it feels.''

<p/>Mr. Ross knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) must better understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
loss, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) was a widower, and was greatly touched, though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) only answered by a blessing, a farewell, and a promise to
come very soon to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) again.

<p/>Amabel was right, the peace which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) had recalled, and the
power of resignation that had returned, had a better effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
tlian all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother's precautions ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) began to improve, and in

<p/>c



<p/>386 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>a few days more was able to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) bed, and lie on the sofa in
the dressing-room, though slie was still so weak and languid that
this was as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could attempt. Any exertion was to be
carefully guarded against, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) tears now flowed so easily, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was obliged to keep a check on them lest they might again
overpower her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). Mr. Ross came again and again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was able
to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) much of the grounds for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) great happiness in Guy,
hear how entirely he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and be assured that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had done right, and not taken an undue responsibility on
herself by the argument she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had used to summon Philip, that
last evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had begun to make herself uneasy about this ;
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was thinking of nothing but Guy, and
had acted on impulse ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was very glad Mr. Ross did not
think it wrong, while Mr. Ross meanwhile was thinking how fears
and repentance mingle with the purest sweetest, holiest deeds.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was able now to take pleasure in seeing Mary Ross ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>)
wrote to Philip at Corfu, and sent for Markham to begin to settle
the executor's business. Poor Markham ! the Edmonstones
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) looked ten years older when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) arrived, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
inquiry for Lady Morville, his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) grunt almost amounted to a sob.
The hrst thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) did was to give Mrs. Edmonstone a note, and
a little box sent from Mrs. Ashford. The note was to say that
Mrs. Ashford had intended for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) wedding present, a little
cross made out of part of the wood of the wreck, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) now
thought it best to send to Mrs. Edmonstone, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) might
judge whether Lady Morville would like to see it.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone's judgment was to carry it at once to
Amabel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) was right, for the pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) took in it was
indescribable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fondled it, set it up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little table,
made Charlotte put it in different places that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) might see what
point of view suited it best, had it given back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), held it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hands caressingly, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must write at once to Mrs.
Ashford to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) for understanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) so well. There was
scarcely one of the mourners to be pitied more than Markham ;
for the love he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had set on Sir Guy had been intense, compounded
of feudal affection, devoted admiration, and paternal care -- and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), the very flower of the whole race, should thus have been
cut down in the full blossom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) youth and hopes, was almost
more than the old man could bear or understand. It was a great
sorrow, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) should be buried so far away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) fore-
fathers ; and the hearing it was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own desire, did not satisfy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sighed over it still, and seemed to derive a shade of
comfort only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was told there was to be a tablet in
Redclyffe church to the memory of Guy, sixth baronet.

<p/>In the evening Markham became very confidential with
Charles ; telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) about the grievous mourning and lamenta-
tion at Redclyffe, when the bells rung a knell instead of greeting
the young master and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bride, and how there was scarcely one
in the parish that did not feel as if they had lost a son or a brother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) also told more and more of Sir Guy's excellence, and talked of



<p/>THE rHEIR OF REDCLYFFE 387

<p/>fears of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own, especially last Christmas ; that the boy was too
unlike otlier people, too good to live ; and lastly, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) indulged in
a little abuse of Captain Morville, which did Charles's heart good,
at the same time as it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to think how Markham would
recollect it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) came to liear of Laura's engagement.

<p/>In the course of the next day, Markham had liis conference
with Lady Morville in the dressing-room, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) two
or three precious parcels, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would not, for the world,
have given into any other hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could hardly bear to look
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) widow's cap, and behaved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) with a manner
varying between his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) deference and respect to the Lady of Red-
clyfFe, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) fatherly fondness for tlie wife of ' his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) boy.'' As to
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) legal powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would have thought them foolishly bestowed,
if they had been conferred by any one save his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) own Sir Guy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) began by not much liking to act with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so clear-headed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was much surprised to find a woman
could have so much good sense, and began to look forward with
some satisfaction to being her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) prime minister. They understood
each other very well ; Amabel's good sense and way of attending
to the one matter in hand, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) from puzzling and alarming
herself by thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had more to do than she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could ever
understand or accomplish ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) knew it was Guy's work, and a
charge he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), -- a great proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) confidence, -- and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did all that was required of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) very well, so that matters
were put in train to be completed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) should be of age, in
the course of the next January.

<p/>When Markham left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was glad to be alone, and to open
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) parcels. There was nothing here to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hysterical, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was going to contemplate the living soul, and felt almost as
if it was again being alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband. There were his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
most prized and used books, covered with marks and written
notes ; there was Laura's drawing of Sintram, which had lived
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rooms at Oxford ; there was a roll of music, and
there was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) desk. The first thing when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) opened it was a
rough piece of spar, wrapped in paper, on which was written,
' M. A. D., Sept. 18.<div class="bookquote">'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) remembered what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) of
little Marianne's gift. The next thing made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) heart thrill, for
it was a slip of pencilling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own writing, ' Little things, on
little wings, bear little souls to heaven.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own letters tied up together, those few that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
written in the short time they were separated just before their
marriage ! Could that be only six months ago ? A great bundle
of Charles's and of Mrs. Edmonstone's ; those she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) might like to
read another time, but not now. Many other papers, letters
signed S. B. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) threw aside, notes of lectures, and
memoranda, only precious for the handwriting ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
came to the lower division, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) found it full of verses, almost all
the poetry he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had ever written.

<p/>There were the classical translations that used to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
inaccurate, a scrap of a very boyish epic about King Arthur,

<p/>C02



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE



<p/>beo-inning -fdth a storm at Tintagel, sundry half ballads the
ve?ses he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was suspected of, and never would show that hrst
summer at Hollywell, and a very touchnig ^^slon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) fair
voung mother. Except a translation or two, some words written
to suit their favourite airs -LRB-a thing that used to seem to come as
easily to him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) as singing to a bird-RRB-, and a few lively mock heroic
accounts of walks or parties, which had all been public property ;
there was no more that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could believe to have been composed
till last year, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was more disposed to versify m sorrow than
in ioy There were a good many written during his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) loneliness,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) reflections had a tendency to flow into verse, and pouring
them out thus had been a great solace. The lines were often
imperfect and irregular, but not one that was not deep, pure
and genuine, and here and there scattered with passages ot
exquisite beauty and harmony, and full of power and grace. JNo
one could have looked at them without owning m them the
marks of a thorough poet ; but this was not what the wite was
seeking, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) perceived it, though it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) tace
beam with a sort of satisfied pride, it was a secondary thing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was studying not his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) intellect, but his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) soul ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) did not care
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) would have been a poet, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) looked for was the
record of the suff<div class="bookquote">``erings and struggles of the sad six months
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) character was established, strengthened, and settled.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) found it. There was much to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) alone had the
clue, too deep, and too obscurely hinted, to be understood at a
glance She (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) met with such evidence of suffering as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
shudder and weep, tokens of the dark thoughts that had gathered
round him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>), of the manful spirit of penitence and patience that
had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) stay, and of the gleams that hghted his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) darkest
hours, and showed he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had never been quite forsaken I^Jow and
then came a reference which brought home what he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) • how the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) Verena had cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
dared not hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) would be restored. Best of all were the lines
written when the radiance of Christmas was, once for all, dis-
persing the gloom, and the vision opening on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was
now realizing. In reading them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) felt the same marvellous
sympathy of subdued wondering joy in the victory of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
had partaken as she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) knelt beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) death-bed. These were the
last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had been too happy for poetry, except one or two
scraps in Switzerland, and these had been hers from the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
had detected them. , tx i j

<p/>No wonder Amabel almost lived on those papers ! It would
not be too much to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was very happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own way when
alone with them ; the desk on a chair by her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) sofa. They were
too sacred for any one else ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) did not for many weeks show
one even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) mother ; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) they were like a renewal ot
his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) presence, soothing the craving after him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) that had been grow-
ing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) ever since the first few days when his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) sustaining power
had not passed away. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) sorted them, and made out their
dates, finding fresh stores of meaning at each fresh perusal she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 389

<p/>learnt through them, as well as through her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) own trial, so patiently
borne, to enter into liis character even more fully tlian when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) sight. Mrs. Edmonstone, who had at first been in-
clined to dread her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) constant dwelling on them, soon perceived
that they were her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>). great aids through this sad winter.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had much pleasure in receiving the portrait, which was
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) by Mr. Shene. It was a day or two before she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) could
resolve to look at it, or feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) could do so calmly. It was
an unfinished sketch, taken more with a view to the future
picture than to the likeness ; but Guy's was a face to be better
represented by being somewhat idealized, than by copying merely
tlie material form of the features. An ordinary artist might
have made him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) like a Morville ; but Mr. vShene had shown all
that art could convey of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) individual self, with almost one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) unearthly looks. The beautiful eyes, with somewhat of their
peculiar lightsomeness, the flexible look of the lip, the upward
pose of the head, the set of that lock of hair that used to wave
in the wind, the animated position, `just ready for a start,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as
Charles used to call it, were recalled as far as was in the power
of chalk and crayon, but so as to remind Amabel of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more
as one belonging to heaven tlian to earth. The picture used to
be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mantel-shelf all night, the shipwreck cross before it,
and Sintram and Redclyfie on each side ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) brought it into
the dressing-room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in the morning, setting it u^^ opposite
to the sofa, before settling herself.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) days were much alike. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) felt far from well, or capable
of exertion, and was glad it was thought right to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
entirely upstairs ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) only wished to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother anxiety,
by being submissive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) care, in case these cares should be the
last for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not dwell on the future, nor ask herself
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked for life or death. Guy had bidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) not
desire the last, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did not form a wish ; but
there was repose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in the belief that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ought not to
conceal from herself that there was more than ordinary risk, and
that it was right to complete all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) affairs in this world, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was silent when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother tried to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in prospects
that might cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; as if afraid to fasten on them, and finding
more peace in entire submission, than in feeding herself on hope
that must be coupled with fear.

<p/>Christmas-day was not allowed to pass without being a festival
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) quiet room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lay, full of musings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
lonely Cliristmas night last year, his (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) verses folded among her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
precious books, and the real joy of the season more witliin her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
grasp than in the turmoil of last year. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was not afraid noio
to let herself fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) voice in the Angel's Song, and the
rainbow was shining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cloud.



<p/>390 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII

<p/>The coldness from my heart is gone,

<p/>But still the weight is there,
And thoughts which I abhor will come

<p/>To tempt me to despair.-- So uthey

<p/>Amabel's one anxiety was for Philip. For a long time
nothing was heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at Hollywell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) began to fear
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might have been less fit to take care of himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
had persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to believe. When at length tidings reached
them, it was through the De Courcys. ' Poor Morville/ wrote
Maurice, ' had been carried ashore at Corfu, in the stupor of a
second attack of fever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been in extreme danger for some
time, and though now on the mend, was still unable to give any
account of himself.''

<p/>In effect, it was a relapse of the former disease, chiefly affecting
the brain ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) impatience to leave Recoara, and free himself
from Arnaud, had l^een a symptom of its approach, though it
fortunately did not absolutely overpower him (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) till after he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had
embarked for Corfu, and was in the way to be tended with the
greatest solicitude. Long after the fever was subdued, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)
strength returning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) mind was astray ; and even when tortur-
ing delusions ceased, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) resumed the perception of surround-
ing objects, memory and reflection Avavered in dizzy confusion,
more distressing than either his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) bodily weakness, or the perpetual
pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) head, which no remedy could relieve.

<p/>The first date to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) could afterwards recur, though for
more than a week he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) had apparently been fully himself, was a
time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) was sitting in an easy-chair by the window, obliged
to avert his (<font color='blue'><b>Arnaud</b></font>) heavy eyes from the dazzling waters of the Corcyran
bay, where Ulysses' transformed ship gleamed in the sunshine,
and the rich purple hills of Albania sloped upwardsinthedistance.
James Thorndale was, as usual, with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>), and Avas explaining
that there had been a consultation between the doctor and the
colonel, and they had decided that as there was not much chance
of restoring his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) health in that climate in the spring

<p/>' Spring ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) interrupted, with surprise and eagerness. ' Is it
spring V

<p/>' Hardly -- except that there is no Avinter here. This is the 8th
of January.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) head fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) hand again, and listened with indif-
ference when told he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was to be sent to England at once, under
the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) servant, Bolton, and Mr. Thorndale himself, who
was resolved to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) sister's liands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) made no
objection ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) had become used to be jDassive, and one place was
much the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) as another ; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) merely assented, without
a question about the arrangements. Presently, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)
looked up, and inquired for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) letters. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) had done so



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 391

<p/>before, the request had always been evaded, until now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) spoke
in a manner which decided his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) friend on giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) all except
one with broad black edges, and Broadstone post-mark ; the
effect of which, it was thought, might be very injurious to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)
shattered nerves and spirits.

<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) turned over the other letters without interest,
just glancing languidly through them, looked disappointed, and
exclaimed --

<p/>' None from Holly well ! Has nothing been heard trom them j
Thorndale, I insist on knowing whether De Courcy has heard
anything of Lady Morville.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) has heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) arrival in England.

<p/>' My sister mentions that-- more than two months ago-- I can
hardly believe she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has not written, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was able. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pro-
mised, yet how can I expect ' then interrupting himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)

<p/>added, authoritatively, ' Thorndale, is there no letter for me ? I
see there is. Let me have it.''

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) friend could not but comply, and had no reason to regret
having done so ; for after reading it twice, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) sighed
deeply, and the tears were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was more calm and less
oppressed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) had been at any time since his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) arrival in
Corfu. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was unable to write, but Colonel Deane had under-
taken to write to Mrs. Henley to announce his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) coming ; and as
the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) silence must be known at Holly well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) resolved
to let Amabel's letter wait for a reply till his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) arrival in England.
It was on a chilly day in February that Mrs. Henley drove to
the station to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother, looking forward with a sister's
satisfaction to nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) recovery, and feeling -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had a
heart, after all-RRB- as if it was a renewal of the days, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
regarded with a tenderness mixed with contempt, when all was
confidence between the brother and sister, the days of nonsense
and romance. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hoped that now poor Philip, who had acted
hastily on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) romance, and ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own prospects for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
sake in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) boyish days, had a chance of having it all made up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and reigning at Redclyffe according to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) darling wish.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) anxiously watched the arrival of the tram, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) recog-
nized Mr. Thorndale, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) school-days
as Philip's i^rotege-- hut could that be her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother ? It was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
height, indeed ; but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) slow weary step as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) crossed the plat-
form, and left the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) baggage to others, was so unlike
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) prompt, independent air, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could hardly believe it to
be himself, till, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) actually advanced to the
carriage, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw far deeper traces of illness than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
Avas prepared for. A confusion of words took place ; greetings
on one hand, and partings on the other, for James Thorndale was
going on by the train, and made only a few minutes' halt m
which to assure Mrs. Henley that thougli the landing and the
journey had knocked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) patient to-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was much better
since leaving Corfu, and to beg Philip to write as soon as possible.
The bell rang, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rushed back, and was whirled away.



<p/>392 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Then you are better/ said Mrs. Henley, anxiously surveying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother. ' You are sadly altered ! You must let us take
good care of you.''

<p/>' Thank you ! I knew you would be ready to receive me,
though I fear I am not very good company.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say no more, my dearest brother. You know both Dr.
Henley and myself have made it our first object that our house
should be your home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Thank you.''

<p/>* This salubrious air must benefit you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) added. ' How thin
you are ! Are you very much fatigued ? '

<p/>' Rather,'' said Philip, who was leaning back wearily ; but the
next moment li6 exclaimed, ' What do you hear from Holly well ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no news yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) is ? When did you hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' About a week ago ; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) wrote to inquire for you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) did! What did she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) say of herself ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Nothing particular, poor little thing ; I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) is always
on the sofa. My aunt would like nothing so well as making a
great fuss about her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

<p/>' Have you any objection to show me her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) letter ? ' said Philip,
unable to bear hearing Amabel thus spoken of, yet desirous to
learn all he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/>' I have not preserved it,<div class="bookquote">'' was the answer. ' My correspond-
ence is so extensive that there would be no limit to the accumu-
lation if I did not destroy the trivial letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a sudden flush on Philip's pale face that caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
sister to pause in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) measured, self-satisfied speech, and ask if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was in pain.

<p/>' No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) replied, shortly, and Margaret pondered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) strange
manner, little guessing what profanation her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mention of Amabel's
letter had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), or hoAV it jarred on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to hear this
exaggerated likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own self-complacent speeches.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was much shocked and grieved to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so much more
unwell than slie had expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was unfit for anything but to
go to bed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arrival. Dr. Henley said the system had received
a severe shock, and it would be long before the effects would be
shaken off'' ; but that there was no fear but his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) health would be
completely restored if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) would give himself entire rest.

<p/>There was no danger that Margaret would not lavish care
enough on her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) room all the
next day, bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) everything he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could want, and trying to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come down-stairs, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) thought sitting alone there
very bad for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spirits ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had a letter to write, and
very curious she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was to know why he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so long doing it, and
why he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) to whom it was addressed. However,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw when it was put into the post-bag, that it was for Lady
Morville.

<p/>At last, too late to see any. of the visitors who had called to
inquire, when the evening had long closed in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had the satis-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 393

<p/>faction of seeing Philip enter the drawing-room, and settling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in the most comfortable of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) easy-chairs on one side of the
lire to wait till the Doctor returned for dinner. The whole apart-
ment was most luxurious, spacious, and richly furnished ; the
fire, in its brilliant steel setting, glancing on all around, and
illuminating her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) own stately presence, and rich glace silk, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
sat opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother cutting open the leaves of one of the
books of the club over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) presided. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) felt that this
was something like attaining one of the objects for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
used to say and think she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) married, -- namely, to be able to receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother in a comfortable home. If only he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would but look
more like himself.

<p/>' Do you like a cushion for your head, Philip ? Is it better ? '

<p/>' Better since morning, thank you.''

<p/>' Did those headaches come on before your second illness ? '

<p/>' I can't distinctly remember.''

<p/>' Ah ! I cannot think how the Edmonstones could leave you.
I shall always blame them for that relapse.''

<p/>' It had nothing to do with it. Their remaining was impossible.''

<p/>' On Amabel's account ? No, poor thing, I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must have been quite heljDless ; but it was exactly like my
aunt, to have but one idea at a time. Charles used to be the
idol, and now it is Amy, I suppose.''

<p/>' If any thing could have made it more intolerable forme, it would
have been detaining them there for my sake, at such a time.''

<p/>' Ah ! I felt a great deal for you. You must have been very
sorry for that poor little Amy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was very kind in writing
while you were ill. How did she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) contrive, poor child ? I sup-
pose you took all the head work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) 1 '

<p/>' I ? I was nothing but a burden.''

<p/>' Were you still so very ill ? ' said Margaret, tenderly. ' I am
sure you must have been neglected.''

<p/>' Would that I had ! ' muttered Philip, so low that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) did not
catch the words. Then aloud, -- ' No care could have been greater
than was taken for me. It was as if no one had been ill but my-
self, and the whole thought of every one had been for me.''

<p/>' Then Amabel managed well, poor thing ! We do sometimes
see those weak soft characters -- '

<p/>' Sister ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) interrupted.

<p/>' Have not you told me so yourself ? '

<p/>' I was a fool, or worse,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), in a tone of suffering. ' No
words can describe what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sister</b></font>) proved herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div><p/>' Self-possessed 1 energetic 1 ' asked Mrs. Henley, with whom
those were the first of qualities ; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother paused from
repugnance to speak of Amabel to one so little capable of com-
prehending her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) proceeded : ' No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) did the best she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) must have been quite inexperienced. It was a
very young thing in the poor youth to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) executrix. I
wonder the will was valid ; but I suppose you took care of that.''

<p/>' I did nothing.''



<p/>394 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Did you see it 1 '

<p/>* My uncle showed it to me.''

<p/>' Then you can tell me what I want to hear, for no one has
told me anything. I suppose my uncle is to be guardian 1 '

<p/>' No ; Lady Morville.''

<p/>``You don't mean it? Most lover-like indeed. That poor
girl to manage that great property ! Everything left to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ? '
said Mrs. Henley, continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) catechism in spite of the un-
willingness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) replies. ' Were there any legacies 1 I know of
Miss Well wood<div class="bookquote">``s.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dixon/Mr. Dixon</b></font>)</div><p/>' That to Dixon's daughter, and my own,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) answered.

<p/>' Yours 1 How was it that I never heard of it ? What is it 1'

<p/>' Ten thousand,'' said Philip, sadly.

<p/>' I am delighted to hear it ! ' cried Margaret. ' Very proper
of Sir Guy -- very proper indeed, poor youth. It is well thought
of to soften the disappointment.''

<p/>Philip started forward. ' Disappointment ! ' exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
with horror.

<p/>' You need not look as if I wished to commit murder,'' said
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``Have you forgotten that it depends on
whether it is a son or daughter 1 '

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) dismay was not lessened. ' Do you mean to say that this
is to come on me if the child is a daughter 1 '

<p/>' Ah ! you were so young when the entail was made, that you
knew nothing of it. Female heirs were expressly excluded.
There was some aunt whom old Sir Guy passed over, and settled
the property on my father and you, failing his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own male heirs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No one would take advantage of such a chance,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Do not make any rash resolutions, my dear brother, whatever
you do,'' said Margaret. ' You have still the same fresh romantic
generous spirit of self-sacrifice that is generally so soon worn
out, but you must not let it allow you -- ■'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough of this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip, hastily, for every word was a
dagger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah ! you are right not to dwell on the uncertainty. I am almost
sorry I told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Morville</b></font>)</div>said Margaret. ' Tell me about Miss Wellwood's
legacy,<div class="bookquote">'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) continued, desirous of changing the subject. ' I want
to know the truth of it, for every one is talking of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Wellwood/Wellwood</b></font>)</div><p/>' How comes the world to know of it ? '

<p/>* There have been reports ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) death, and now it has
been paid, whatever it is, on Lady Morville's coming of age. Do
you know what it is ? The last story I was told was, that it
was #20,000, to found a convent to pray for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) grand -- '

<p/>' Five thousand for Iier hospital,<div class="bookquote">'' interrupted Philip. ' Sister ! '
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) added, speaking with effort, ' it was for tliat hospital that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
made the request for which we -- persecuted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ah ! I thought so, I could have told you so ! ' cried Margaret,
triumphant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sagacity, but astonished, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) brother started
up and stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could hardly resolve to give
credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) words. ' You-- thought-- so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) repeated slowly.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 396

<p/>' I guessed it from the first. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was always with that set,
and I thought it a very bad thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ; but as it was only
a guess, it was not worth while to mention it : besides, the
cheque seemed full evidence. It was the general course, not the
individual action.''

<p/>' If you thought so, why not mention it to me 1 Oh ! sister,
Avhat would you not have spared me ! '

<p/>' I might liave done so if it had appeared that it might lead to
liis exculpation ; but you were so fully convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) whole
course confirmed the suspicions, that a mere vague idea was not
worth dwelling on. Your general opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) satisfied me.''

<p/>' I cannot blame you,'' was all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) reply, as lie sat down again,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face averted from the light.

<p/>And Mrs. Henley was doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
had been judicious ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) spoke again, unconscious of the agony
each word, inflicted.

<p/>' Poor youth ! we were mistaken in those facts, and of course,
all is forgiven and forgotten now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) certainly had a
tremendous temper. I sliall never forget that exhibition.
Perhaps poor Amabel is saved much unhappiness.''

<p/>' Once for all,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, sternly, ' let me never hear you speak
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thus. We were both blind to a greatness of soul and purity
of heart that we shall never meet again. Yours was only preju-
dice ; mine I must call by a darker name. Remember, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wife are only to be spoken of with reverence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) composed liimself to silence ; and Margaret, after look-
ing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for some moments in wonder, began in a sort of
exculpatory tone :

<p/>_ ' Of course we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a great deal of gratitude. It was very
kind and proper to come to you when you were ill, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
death must have been a terrible shock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was a fine young
man ; amiable, very attractive in manner.''

<p/>' No more ! ' muttered Philip.

<p/>' That, you always said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' continued she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), not hearing ;
' but you have no need to reproach yourself. You always acted
tlie part of a true friend ; did full justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) many good
qualities, and only sought his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) real good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every word you speak is the bitterest satire on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said
Philip, goaded into rousing himself for a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Say no
more, unless you would drive me distracted ! '

<p/>Margaret was obliged to be silent, and marvel, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
brother sat motionless, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chair, till Dr. Henley
came in ; and after a few words to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), went on talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
wife, till dinner was announced. Philip went with them into
the dining-room, but had scarcely sat down before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
could not stay, and returned to the drawing-room sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only wanted quiet and darkness, and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
husband back to their dinner.

<p/>' What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) been doing 1 ' said the Doctor ; ' here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)
pulse up to a hundred again. How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) have raised it 1 '



<p/>396 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) only came down an hour ago, and has been sitting still
ever since.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Talking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; and there, perhaps, I was rather imprudent. I did not
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could so little bear to hear poor Sir Guy's name men-
tioned ; and, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not know, till I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
had so much chance of E,edclyfFe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not know the entail
excluded daughters.''

<p/>' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not 1 That accounts for it. I should like to see the
man who could hear coolly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so near such a property.
This suspense is unlucky just now ; very much against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
You must turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts from it as much as possible.''

<p/>All the next day, Mrs. Henley wondered why her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother's
spirits were so much depressed, resisting every attempt to amuse
or cheer them ; but, on the third, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) thought some light was
thrown on the matter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was at breakfast with the Doctor
when the post came in, and there was a black-edged letter for
Captain Morville, e^ddently from Amabel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) took it up at
once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) hand for it eagerly, but
laid it down, and would not open it while she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was in the room.

<p/>The instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was gone, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) broke the seal and read : --

<p/>``Hollywell, February 20th.

<p/>' My dear Philip, -- Thank you much for writing to me. It
was a great comfort to see your writing again, and to hear of
your being safe in our own country. We had been very anxious
about you, though we did not hear of your illness till the worst
was over. I am very glad you are at St. Mildred's ; for I am
sure Margaret must be very careful of you, and Stylehurst air
must be good for you. Every one here is well ; Charles growing
almost active, and looking better than I ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). I wish
I could tell you how nice and quiet a winter it has been ; it has
been a great blessing to me in every way, so many things have
come to me to enjoy. Mr. Ross has come to me every Sunday,
and often in the week, and has been so A^ery kind. I think talk-
ing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) will be a great pleasure to you when you are here
again. You will like to hear that Mr. Shene has sent me the
picture, and the pleasure it gives me increases every day. Indeed,
I am so well off in every way, that you must not grieve yourself
about me, though I thank you very much for what you say.
Laura reads to me all the evening from dinner to tea. I am
much better than I was in the winter, and am enjoying the soft
spring air from the open window, making it seem as if it was
much later in the year.

<p/>' Good-bye, my dear cousin ; may God bless and comfort you.
Remember, that after all, it was God's will, not your doing ; and
therefore, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said himself, all is as it should be, and so it will
surely be.

<p/>' Your affectionate cousin,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amabel F. Mokville.''



 (<font color='red'><b>cousin Mokville</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 397

<p/>Childislily simple as this letter might be called, with its set of
facts without comment, and the very commonplace words of
consolation, it spoke volumes to Philip of the spirit in which it
was written -- resignation, pardon, soothing, and a desire that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) farewell, perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) last, should carry with it a token of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) perfect forgiveness. Everything from Amabel did him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good ;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was so perceptibly better, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister exclaimed, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was next alone with Dr. Henley, ' I understand it all, poor
fellow ; I thought long ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had some secret attachment ;
and now I see it was to Amabel Edmonstone.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ToLady Morville?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You know how constantly he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was at Holly well, my
aunt so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ? I don't suppose Amy knew of it ; and, of
course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could not be blamed for accepting such an offer as
Sir Guy's ; besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never had much opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How? No bad speculation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must have a
handsome jointure ; but what are your grounds ? '

<p/>' Everything. Don't you remember he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not go to the mar-
riage 1 He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mentions her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) almost like a saint ; can't hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) name
from any one else -- keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) letter to open alone, is more revived
by it than anything else. Ah ! depend upon it, it was to avoid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), poor fellow, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) refused to go to Venice with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>' Their going to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not as if Sir Guy suspected it.''

<p/>' I don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did, nor Amy either. No one ever had
so much power over himself.''

<p/>Philip would not have thanked his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) surmise, but
it was sO far in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) favour that it made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) avoid the subject,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was thus spared from hearing much of Amabel or of Red-
clyffe. It was bad enough without this. Sometimes in nursery
tales, a naughty child, under the care of a fairy, is chained to an
exaggeration of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own faults, and rendered a slave
to this hateful self. The infliction he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) underwent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sister's
house was somewhat analogous ; for Mrs. Henley's whole cha-
racter, and especially her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) complacent speeches, were a strong
resemblance of his (<font color='blue'><b>cha</b></font>) own in the days he (<font color='blue'><b>cha</b></font>) most regretted. He (<font color='blue'><b>cha</b></font>) had
ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) marriage regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) as a man looks at a fallen
idol ; but never had her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) alteration been so clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
not spent much time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) short visits, and
passing the chief of each day at Stylehurst. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was almost
entirely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) mercy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) unvarying kindness to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) caused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) deterioration to pain him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) all the more ; while each self-asser-
tion, or harsh judgment, sounded on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ear like a repetition of
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) worst and most hateful presumption. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) little guessed
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) endure, for he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) wonted stoicism
of demeanour, though the hardened crust that had once grown
over his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) feelings had been roughly torn away, leaving an extreme
soreness and tenderness to which an acute pang was given
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was reminded, not only of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) injuries to Guy, but
of the pride and secret envy that had been their root.
. At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) disappointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) continued reserve



<p/>398 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>and depression. The confidence she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had forfeited was never to be
restored, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was the last person to know how incapable she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
was of receiving it, or how low she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) self -exaltation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was soon able to resume the hours of the family, but was
still far from well ; suffering from languor, pain in the head,
want of sleep and appetite ; and an evening feverishness. He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
was unequal to deep reading, and was in no frame for light books ;
he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) could not walk far, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) sister's literary coteries, which he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
had always despised, were at present beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) powers of endur-
ance. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hoped that society would divert his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) thoughts and
raise his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) spirits, and arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) -RSB-Darties with a view to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) ;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) never could stay long in the room, and Dr. Henley, who,
though proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) wife and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) talents, had little pleasure in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) learned circle, used to aid and abet his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) escape.

<p/>Thus Philip got through the hours as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might ; idly
turning the pages of new club-books, wandering on the hills till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tired himself ; sitting down to rest in the damp air, coming
home chilled and fatigued, and lying on the sofa with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes
shut, to avoid conversation, all the evening. Neither strength,
energy, nor intellect would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for more ; and this, with
the load and the stings of a profound repentance, formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
history through the next fortnight.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) used often to stand gazing at the slowly-rising walls of
Miss Wellwood's buildings, and the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exerted himself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) old way to put down any folly in conversation, was when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) silenced some of the nonsense talked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), and evinced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own entire approval of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) proceedings.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIX

<p/>Beneath a tapering ash-tree's shade

<p/>Three graves are by each other laid.
Around the very place doth brood

<p/>A strange and holy quietude.-- Baptistery

<p/>Late on the afternoon of the 6th of March, Mary Ross entered
by the half -opened front door at Holly well, just as Charles
appeared slowly descending the stairs.

<p/>' Well ! how is she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) ? ' asked Mary eagerly.

<p/>' Poor little dear ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered, with a sigh ; ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) looks very
nice and comfortable.''

<p/>' What, you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' I am at this moment leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) room.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>) is going on well, I hope 1 '

<p/>' Perfectly well. There is one comfort at least,'' said Charles,
drawing himself down the last step.

<p/>' Dear Amy ! And the babe -- did you see it ? '

<p/>' Yes ; the little creature was lying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hand on it, and gave one of those smiles that are so terribly lik^



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 399

<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; but I could not have spoken about it for the world. Such
fools we be ! ' concluded Charles, with an attempt at a smile.

<p/>' It is healthy ? '

<p/>' All a babe ought to be, they say, all that could be expected
of it, except the not being of tlie right sort, and if Amy does not
mind that, I don't know who should,'' and Charles deposited
himself on the sofa, heaving a deep sigh, intended to pass for the
conclusion of the exertion.

<p/>' Then you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is not disapjDointed ? '

<p/>' Certainly not. The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was told it
was a girl, was, <div class="bookquote">'' I am so glad ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does seem very happy
with it, poor little thing ! In fact, mamma thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had so
little expected that it would go well with herself, or with it, that
now it is all like a surprise.''

<p/>There was a silence, first broken by Charles saying, ' You must
be content with me -- I can't send for any one. Bustle has taken
papa and Charlotte for a walk, and Laura is on guard over Amy,
for we have made mamma go and lie down. It was high time,
after sitting up two nights, and meaning to sit up a third.''

<p/>' Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) really -- can she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bear it ? '

<p/>' Yes ; I am afraid I have trained her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in sitting up, and Amy
and all of us know that anxiety hurts her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) more than fatigue.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would only lie awake worrying herself, instead of sitting
peaceably by the fire, holding the baby, or watching Amy, and
having a quiet cry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is asleep. For, after all, it is very
sad ! ' Charles was trying to brave his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) feelings, but did not suc-
ceed very well. ' Yesterday morning I was properly frightened.
I came into the dressing-room, and found mamma crying so,
that I fully believed it was all wrong ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was just coming
to tell us, and was only overcome by thinking of not having him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
to call first, and how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would have been.''

<p/>' And the dear Amy herself ! '

<p/>' I can't tell. Slie is a wonderful person for keeping herself
composed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ought. I see she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) picture in full view,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) says not a word, except that mamma saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to-day, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) thought no one was looking, fondling the little thing, and
whispering to it -- <div class="bookquote">'' Guy's baby ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Guy's little messenger ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>'
Charles gave up the struggle, and fairly cried, but in a moment
rallying his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) usual tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went on, half laughing, -- ' To be sure,
what a morsel of a creature it is ! It is awful to see anything
so small calling itself a specimen of humanity ! '

<p/>' It is your first acquaintance with infant humanity, I suppose ?
Pray, did you ever see a baby ? '

<p/>' Not to look at. In fact, Mary, I consider it a proof of your
being a rational woman that you have not asked me whether it
is pretty.''

<p/>' I thought you no judge of the article.''

<p/>' No, it was not to inspect it that Amy sent for me ; though
after all it was for a business I would almost as soon undertake,
a thing I would not do for any other living creature.''



<p/>400 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Then I know what it is. To write some kind message to
Captain Morville. Just like the dear Amy ! '

<p/>' Just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and like no one else, except Of course my

<p/>father wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) an official communication yesterday, very
short ; but the fact must have made it sweet enough, savage as
we all were towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as there was no one else to be savage
to, unless it might be poor Miss Morville, who is the chief loser
by being of the feminine gender,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, again braving
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was pleased to call sentimentality. ' Well, by and by,
my lady wants to know if any one has written to ''  (<font color='red'><b>the loser</b></font>)</div>jDoor Philip,''
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) vdll call him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and, by no means contented by hearing papa
had, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sends to ask me to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) when I came in from
wheeling in the garden ; and receives me with a request that I
would write and tell liim how well she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is, and how glad, and so
on. There's a piece of work for me ! '

<p/>' Luckily you are not quite so savage as you pretend, either
to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), or your poor little niece.''

<p/>' Whew ! I should not care whether she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was niece or nephew
but for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) ; at least not much, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) comforted Amy ;
but to see him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) at RedclyfFe, and be obliged to make much of him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
at the same time, is more than I can very well bear ; though I
may as well swallow it as best I can, for she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) will have me do it,
as well as on Laura's account. Amy believes, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
will think the inheritance a great misfortune ; but that is only
a proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is more amiable than any one else.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not rejoice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not exactly ; but I have no fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will not console
himself by thinking of the good he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will do with it. I have no
doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was thoroughly cut up, and I could even go the
length of believing that distress of mind helped to bring on the
relapse ; but it is some time ago. And as to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
heart after the first ten minutes at finding himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has
all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) life desired to be, in a situation where the full influence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) talents may be felt,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, with a shade of imita-
tion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) measured tones, `why that, no one but silly little
Amy would ever dream of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' Well, I dare say you will grow merciful as you write.''

<p/>' No, that is not the way to let my indignation ooze out at
my fingers' ends. I shall begin by writing to condole with
Markham. Poor man ! what a state he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) must be in ; all the more
pitiable because he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) evidently had entirely forgotten that there
could ever be a creature of the less worthy gender born to the
house of Morville ; so it will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) quite by surprise. What
will he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) do, and how will he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) ever forgive Mrs, Ashford, who, I
see in the paper, has a son whom nobody wants, as if for the
express purpose of insulting Markham's feelings ! Well-a-day !
I should have liked to have had the sound of Sir Guy Morville
still iii my ears, and yet I don't know that I could have endured
its being applied to a little senseless baby ! And, after all, we
are the gainers ; for it would have been a forlorn thing to have

notably well would she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) have reigned, with that clear little head

bhe IS much happier without greatness thrust on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and for

<p/>Charles had not talked so like himself for months ; and Mary
telt that Amabel's child, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had disappointed some expecta-
tions, had come like a spring blossom, to cheer Hollywell, after
Its long winter of sorrow and anxiety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) seemed to have
already been received as a messenger to comfort them for the
loss, greatest of all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), poor child, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would never
know how great. Next Mary wondered what kind of letter
Charles would indite, and guessed it would be all the kinder for
the outpouring he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), the only person with whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ventured to indulge in a comfortable abuse of Philip, since
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) good sense taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) that, ending as affairs must, it was
the only wise way to make the best of it, with father, mother,
and Charlotte, all quite sufficiently disposed to regard Philip
with aversion Avithout his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) help.

<p/>Philip was at breakfast with the Henleys, on the following
morning, a Sunday,-- or rather, sitting at the breakfast-table,
when the letters were brought in. Mrs. Henley, pretending to
be occupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) own, had an eager, watchful eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
brother, as one was placed before him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) knew Mr. Edmon-
stone's writing, but was restrained from exclaiming by her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) in-
voluntary deference for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flushed deep red one
moment, then turned deadly pale ; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand, when first he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) raised
it, trembled, but then became firm, as if controlled by the force
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resolution. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) broke the black seal, drew out the letter
paused another instant, unfolded it, glanced at it, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
chair from the table, and hastened to the door.

<p/>``Tell me, tell me, Philip, what is it ? ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) exclaimed, rising to
rollow him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) turned round, threw the letter on the table, and with a
sign that forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), left the room.

<p/>' Poor fellow ! how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) feels it ! That poor young creature ! '
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), catching up the letter for explanation.

<p/>' Ha ! No ! Listen to this, Dr. Henley. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) must have
read it wrong ! '

<p/>' Holly well, March 5th.

<p/>``Dear Philip, -- I have to announce to you that Lady Mor-
ville was safely confined this morning with a daughter. I shall
be ready to send all the papers and accounts of the RedclyfFe
estate to any place you may appoint as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is sufficiently
recovered to transact business. Both she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and the infant are as
well as can be expected. -- Yours sincerely,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C. Edmonstone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>' A daughter ! ' cried Dr. Henley. ' Well, my dear, I congratu-
late you ! It is as fine a property as any in the kingdom. We
shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) pick up strength now.''

<p/>' I must go and find him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) surely has mistaken ! ' said
Margaret, hastening in search of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was not to be
found, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) no more till she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) in the seat
at church.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) hardly waited to be in the churchyard, after the service,
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) said, ' Surely you mistook the letter ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' You saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) is doing well, and it is a girl.''

<p/>``I '

<p/>' And will you not let me congratulate you ? '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was interrupted by some acquaintance ; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
looked round he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was nowhere to be seen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was obliged
to be content with telling every one the news. One or two of
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) many tame gentlemen came home with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to luncheon, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had the satisfaction of dilating on the grandeur of Redclyffe.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brother was not in the drawing-room, but answered when
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) knocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) door.

<p/>' Luncheon is ready. Will yoa come down 1 '

<p/>' Is any one there 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brown and Walter Maitland. Shall I send you any-
thing, or do you like to come down 1 '

<p/>' I'll come, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>), thus secured from a tete-d-tete.

<p/>' Had you better come 1 Is not your head too bad 1 '

<p/>' It will not be better for staying here ; I'll come.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) went down, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) visitors that, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) illness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>)
brother always sufiered so much from excitement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was
too unwell to have derived much pleasure from the tidings : and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) appeared his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) air corresponded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) account, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
looks were of the gravest and sternest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) received the con-
gratulations of the gentlemen without the shadow of a smile,
and made them think him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) the haughtiest and most dignified
landed proprietor in England.

<p/>Mrs. Henley advised strongly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) going to church,
but without effect ; and losing him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) in the crowd coming out,
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) no more till just before dinner-time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had steeled
himself to endure all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) and the Doctor could inflict on him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
that evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had a hope of persuading Amabel tliat it
would be only doing justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) child to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 403

<p/>father's inheritance, which had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) through circum-
stances that could not have been foreseen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was determined
to do nothing like an act of possession of RedclyfFe till he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had
implored her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) to accept the oiier ; and it was a great relief thus
to keep it in doubt a little longer, and not absolutely feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)-
self profiting by Guy's death and sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seat. Not a
word, however, must be said to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sister guess at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) resolu-
tion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) torture him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) in the meantime. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was
vexed at having been startled into betraying his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) suffering, and
was humiliated at the thought of the change from that iron
imperturbability, compounded of strength, pride, and coldness
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had once gloried.

<p/>Dr. Henley met him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) with a shake of the hand, and hearty
exclamation : --

<p/>' I congratulate you. Sir Philip Morville.''

<p/>' No ; that is spared me,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hem! The baronetcy ?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Morville</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you knew that only goes
to the direct heir of old Sir Hugh. But you must drop the
''  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Morville</b></font>)</div>captain '' at least. You will sell out at once ? '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) patiently endured the conversation on the extent and
beauty of Redclyffe, wearing all the time a stern, resolute aspect,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sister knew to betoken great unhappiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ear-
nestly wished to understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) ; but at last, seeing how much
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) conversation increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) headache, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) desisted, and left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) to all the repose his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) thoughts could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was
very much concerned at the tone of the note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) uncle, as
if it was intended to show that all connection with the family
was to be broken off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) supposed it had been concerted with
some one ; with Charles, most likely, -- Charles, who had judged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) too truly, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) attachment to Guy, and aversion
to himself, was doubtless strengthening his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father's displeasure,
all the more for this hateful wealth. And Laura ? What did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) feel 1

<p/>Monday morning brought another letter. At first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
struck with the dread of evil tidings of Amabel or her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) babe,
especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recognized Charles's straggling handwriting ;
and, resolved not to be again betrayed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) carried it up to read
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) own room before his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister had noticed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could
hardly resolve to open it, for surely Charles would not write to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) without necessity ; and what, save sorrow, could cause that
necessity 1 He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wretchedness might be even more
complete ! At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read it, and could hardly believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
own eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) saw cheering words, in a friendly style of interest
and kindliness such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would never have expected from
Charles, more especially now.

<p/>' Hollywell, March 6th.

<p/>``My dear Philip, -- I believe my father wrote to you in
haste yesterday ; but I am sure you will be anxious for further
accounts, and when there is good news there is satisfaction in

<p/>404 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>conveying it. I know you will be glad to hear our affairs are
very prosperous ; and Amy, whom I have just been visiting, is
said by the authorities to be going on as well as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
begs me to tell you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) welfare, and to assure you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is
particularly jDleased to have a daughter ; or, perhaps, it will be
more satisfactory to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own words. <div class="bookquote">'' You must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
how well I am, Charlie, and how very glad. And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) must not vex himself about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) being a girl, for that is my
great pleasure ; and I do believe, the very thing I should have
chosen if I had set to work to wish.''  (<font color='red'><b>a daughter</b></font>)</div>You know Amy never
said a word but in all sincerity, so you must trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ; and I
add my testimony that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is in placid spirits, and may well be
glad to escape the cares of Redclyffe. My father says he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) desired
Markham to write to you on the business matters. I hope the
sea-breezes may do you good. All the party here are well ; but
I see little of them now, all the interest of the house is up-
stairs.-- Your affectionate, ' C. M. Edmonstone.

<p/>' P. S. The baby is very small, but so plump and healthy, that
no one attempts to be uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>).''

<p/>Never did letter come in better time to raise a desponding
peart. Of Amabel's forgiveness he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was already certain ; but
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) should have made Charles his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend was a wonder
beyond all others. It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) more hope for the future than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had yet been able to entertain, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that the
former note was no studied renunciation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but only an
ebullition of Mr. Edmonstone's disappointment.

<p/>It gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) spirit enough to undertake what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had long been
meditating, but without energy to set about it -- an expedition
to Stylehurst. Hitherto it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) first walk on coming to
St. Mildred's, but now the distance across the moor was far
beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) powers ; and even tliat length of ride was a great
enterprise. It was much further by the carriage road, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
sister never liked going there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had never failed to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
old home till last year, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) felt almost glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had not
carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) thouglits, at that time, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) father's grave. ^ It was
strange that, with so many more important burdens on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mind,
it had been this apparent trivial omission, this slight to Style-
hurst, that, in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) illnesses, had been the most frequently
recurring idea that had tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) delirium. So
deeply, securely fixed is the love of the home of childhood in
men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mould, in whom it is perhaps the most deeply rooted
of all affections.

<p/>Without telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) sister his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hired a horse, and
pursued the familiar moorland tracks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) passed South Moor
Farm ; it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) too great a pang to look at it ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) rode on
across the hills where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) used to walk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) sisters, and
looked down into narrow valleys where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had often wandered
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) fishing-rod, lost in musings on plans for attaining dis-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 405

<p/>tinction, and seeing himself the greatest man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day. Little
had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then guessed the misery which would place him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the
way to the coveted elevation, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would loathe it when it
lay within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp.

<p/>There were the trees round the vicarage, the church spire, the
cottages, whose old rough aspect he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew so well, the whole
scene, once `redolent of joy and youth:' but how unable to
breathe on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a second spring ! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put uj-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse at the
village inn, and went to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first call on Susan, the old
clerk's wife, and one of the persons in all the. world who loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knocked, opened the door, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), startled
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) tea-drinking, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a stranger.

<p/>' Bless us ! It beant never Master Philip ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) exclaimed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
head shaking very fast, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) voice. ' Why, sir,
what a turn you give me ! How bad you be looking, to be sure ! '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) sat down and talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), with feelings of comfort.
Tidings of Sir Guy's death had reached the old woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was much grieved for the nice, cheerful-spoken young gentleman,
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) well remembered ; for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), like almost every one who
had ever had any intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), had an impression left
of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as of something winning, engaging, brightening, like a
sunbeam. It was a refreshment to meet with one who would
lament him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own sake, and had no congratulations for
Philip himself ; and the ' Sure, sure, it must have been very bad
for you,'' with which old Susan heard of the circumstances,
carried more of the comfort of genuine sympathy than all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
sister's attempts at condolence.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) how often Sir Guy had been at Stylehurst, how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) about the archdeacon ; and especially she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) helping her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband one day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) trimming the ash over the archdeacon's grave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) used to
come very often to church there, more in the latter part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
stay ; there was one Sunday -- it was the one before Michaelmas
-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was there all day, walking in the churchyard, and sitting
in the porch between services.

<p/>' The Sunday before Michaelmas ! ' thought Philip, the very
time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been most earnest in driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle to per-
secute, and delighting himself in having triumphed over Guy at
last, and obtained tangible demonstration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own foresight,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) cousin's vindictive spirit. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) been throwing
away 1 Where had, in truth, been the hostile spirit ?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took the key of the church, and walked thitlier alone,
standing for several minutes by the three graves, with a sensa-
tion as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father was demanding of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) an account of the
boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had watched, and brought to his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ancestral home, and
cared for through his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) orphaned childhood. But for the prayer-
book, the pledge that there had been peace at the last, how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) have borne it ?

<p/>Here was the paved path he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had trodden in early childhood,
holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) mother's hand, where, at each recurring vacatiou



<p/>406 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>during his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) school days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had walked between his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) admiring
sisters, in the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family
and of all the parish. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) family ? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) not remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
return home for the last time before that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was summoned
thither by his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father's death ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had come with a whole freight
of prizes, and letters full of praises ; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) stood, m expecta-
tion of the expression of delighted satisfaction, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) father laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trophy, the pile of books, saying, gravely,--' All this
would I give, Philip, for one evidence of humility of mmd _

<p/>It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father's one reproof. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had ^ thought it
unjust and unreasonable, and turned away impatiently to be
caressed and admired by Margaret. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) real feelings had been
told to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) flattered them and shared them ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
been reserved and guarded with the father who would have
perceived and repressed that ambition and the self-sufficiency
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) himself had never known to exist, nor regarded as
aught but sober truth. It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bane, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been
always too sensible to betray outwardly his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) self-conceit, in any
form that could lead to its being noticed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opened the church door, closed it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and locked

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came up to the communion rail, where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had knelt for the
first time twelve years ago, confident in himself, and unconscious
of the fears with which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father's voice was trembling m the
intensity of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) prayer for one in whom there was no tangible
evil, and whom others thought a pattern of all that could be
desired by the fondest hopes.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knelt down, with bowed head, and hands clasped. Assur-
edly, if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father could have beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then, it would have
been with rejoicing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not have sorrowed that robust
frame was wasted, and great strength brought low ; that the
noble features were worn, the healthful cheek pale, and the
powerful intellect clouded and weakened ; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would hardly have
mourned for the cruel grief and suffering, such would have been
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) joy that the liumble, penitent, obedient heart had been won
at last. Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have rejoiced that the words that
most soothed that wounded spirit were,--' A broken and contrite
heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.'' ^ , -,

<p/>There was solace in that solemn silence ; the throbs of head
and heart were stilled in the calm around. It was as if the
influences of the prayers breathed for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father, and the
forgiveness and loving spirit there won by Guy, had been waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) there till he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came to take them up, for thenceforth the
bitterest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) despair was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could receive each token
of Amabel's forgiveness, not as lieaped coals of fire, but as an
earnest of forgiveness sealed in heaven.

<p/>The worst was over, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) still had much to suffer,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was becoming open to receive comfort ; the blank dark remorse
in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been living began to lighten, and the tone of
bis mind to return.



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 407

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke more cheerfully to Susan when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) restored the key ;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had been so shocked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) appearance, that when, the
next day, a report reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) that Mr. Philip was now a grand
gentleman, and very rich, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) answered, --

<p/>' Well, if it be so, I am glad of it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said never a word of
it to me, and it is my belief he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would give all the money as
ever was coined, to have the poor young gentleman back again.
Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hates the very sound of it.''

<p/>At the cost of several sheets of paper, Philip at length com-
pleted a letter to Mr. Edmonstone, which, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had sent it,
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) suspense more painful.

<p/>``St. Mildred's, March 12th.

<p/>' My dear Mr. Edmonstone, -- It is with a full sense of the
unfitness of intruding such a subject upon you in the present
state of the family, that I again address you on the same topic
as that on which I wrote to you from Italy, at the first moment
at which I have felt it possible to ask your attention. I was
then too ill to be able to express my contrition for all that has
passed ; in fact, I doubt whether it was even then so deep as at
present, since every succeeding week has but added to my sense
of the impropriety of my conduct, and my earnest desire for
pardon. I can hardly venture at such a time to ask anything
further, but I must add that my sentiments towards your
daughter are unaltered, and can never cease but with my life ;
and though I know I have rendered myself unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), and
my health, both mental and bodily, is far from being re-esta-
blished, I cannot help laying mj?- feelings before you, and
entreating that you will put an end to the suspense which has
endured for so many months, by telling me to hope that I have
not for ever forfeited your consent to my attachment. At least,
I trust to your kindness for telling me on what terms I am for
the present to stand with your family. I am glad to hear sucli
favourable reports of Lady Morville, and with all my heart I
thank Charles for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letter.

<p/>' Yours ever affectionately,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ph. Morville.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ardently watched for a reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could not endure the
idea of receiving it where Margaret's eyes could scan the emotion
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could now only conceal by a visible rigidity of demeanour,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daily went himself to the post-office, but in vain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
received nothing but business letters, and among them one from
Markham, with as much defiance and dislike in its style as could
be shown in a perfectly formal, proper letter. Till he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had
referred to Lady Morville, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would not make any demonstration
towards Redclyffe, and evaded all his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) sister's questions as to what
lie was doing about it, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) should take measures for
leaving the army, or obtaining a renewal of the baronetcy.

<p/>Anxiety made him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) look daily more wretchedly haggard ; the
Doctor was at fault, Mrs. Henley looked sagacious, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)



<p/>408 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>manner became so dry and repellent that visitors went away
moralizing on the absurdity of nouveaux riches taking so much
state on them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) wondered how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) might venture to write to Amabel,
on whom alone he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) could depend ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt it a sort of profanity
to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had nearly given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) visits to the post in despair, when
one morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) beheld what never failed to bring some soothing
influence, namely, the fair pointed characters he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had not dared
to hope for.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) walked quickly into the promenade, sat down, and read : --

<p/>``Holly-well, March 22nd.

<p/>* My dear Philip, -- Papa does not answer your letter, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) says speaking is better than writing, and we hope you are
well enough to come to us before Sunday week. I hope to
take our dear little girl to be christened on that day, and I want
you to be so kind as to be her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) godfather. I ask it of you, not
only in my own name, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's, for I am sure it is
what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would choose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Aunt Laura and Mary Ross are to
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) godmothers. I hope you will not think me very foolish
and fanciful for naming her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) Mary Verena, in remembrance of
our old readings of Sintram. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) is a very healthy, quiet
creature, and I am getting on very well. I am writing from the
dressing-room, and I expect to be down-stairs in a few days. If
you do not dislike it very much, could you be so kind as to call
upon Miss Wellwood, and pay little Marianne Dixon's quarter
for me ? It is #10, and it will save trouble if you would do it ;
besides that, I should like to hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) and the little girl. I
am sorry to hear you are not better, -- perhaps coming here may
do you good. -- Four o'clock. I have been keeping my letter in
hopes of persuading papa to put in a note, but he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had
rather send a message that <div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is quite ready to forgive and
forget, and it will be best to talk it over when you come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' Your aflectionate cousin,

<p/>' A. F. MORVILLE.''

<p/>It was well he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was not under his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister's eye, for he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could not
read this letter calmly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was obliged to take several turns
along the walk before he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could recover his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) composure enough to
appear in the breakfast-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister alone,
dealing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) letters into separate packets of important and unim-
portant.

<p/>' Good morning, Philip. Dr. Henley is obliged to go to Bram-
shaw this morning, and has had an early breakfast. Have you
been out ? '

<p/>*Yes, it is very fine -- I mean it will be -- the haze is clearing.''

<p/>Margaret saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was unusually agitated, and not by
grief ; applied herself to tea-making, and hoped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) walk liad
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) an appetite ; but there seemed little chance of this,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 409

<p/>so long were his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) pauses between each morsel, and so often did he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
lean back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) chair.

<p/>' I am going to leave you on -- on Friday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) said at length,
abruptly.

<p/>' Oh, are you going to Redclyffe ? '

<p/>' No ; to Holly well. Lady Morville wishes me to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) little
girl's sponsor ; I shall go to London on Friday, and on, the next
day.''

<p/>' I am glad they have asked you. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) write herself ? Is
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) pretty well?''

<p/>' Yes ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is to go down-stairs in a day or two.''

<p/>' I am rejoiced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is recovering so well. Do you know
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) is in tolerable spirits 1 '

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) writes cheerfully.''

<p/>' How many years is it since I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) 1 She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was quite a
child ; but very sweet-tempered and attentive to poor Charles,''
said Mrs. Henley, feeling most amiably disposed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
future sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) gentleness and sweet temper were always
beautiful ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) has shown herself under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) trials what it
would be presumptuous to praise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret/Margaret Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Margaret had no doubt now, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was ready for
more open sympathy.

<p/>' You must let me congratulate you now on this unexpected
dawn of hope, after your long trial, my dear brother. It is a
sort of unconscious encouragement you could hardly hope for.''

<p/>' I did not know you knew anything of it,'' said Philip.

<p/>' Ah ! my dear brother, you betrayed yourself. You need not
be disconcerted ; only a sister could see the real cause of your
want of spirits. Your manner at each mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), your
anxiety, coupled with your resolute avoidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) '

<p/>' Of whom 1 Do you know what you are talking of, sister ! '
said Philip, sternly.

<p/>' Of Amabel, of course.''

<p/>Philip rose, perfectly awful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) height and indignation.

<p/>' Sister ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said -- paused, and began again. ' I have been
attached to Laura Edmonstone for years past, and Lady Morville
knows it.''

<p/>' To Laura ? ' cried Mrs. Henley, in amaze. ' Are you engaged 1 '
and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was hardly prepared to answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) continued, ' If you
have not gone too far to recede, only consider before you take
any rash step. You come into this property without ready
money, you will find endless claims, and if you marry at once,
and without fortune, you will never be clear from difiiculties.''

<p/>' I have considered,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) replied, with cold loftiness that would
have silenced any one, not of the same determined mould.

<p/>' You are positively committed, then ! ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) said, much vexed.
' Oh, Philip ! I did not think you would have married for mere
beauty.''

<p/>' I can hear no more discussion on this point,'' answered Philip,



<p/>410 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>in the serious, calm tone that showed so much power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)-
self and every one else.

<p/>It put Margaret to silence, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was excessively disap-
pointed to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thus involved just at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) outset, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
might have married so much more advantageously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) was
sorry, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) opinion so plainly, since it was
to be, and hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) seemed to be thawing.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) would fain have learned more ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was completely shut
up within himself, and never opened again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never
before so grated on every delicate feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
only remained at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) house because,-LSB-in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) present state of health,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hardly knew where to bestow himself till it was time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to go to Hollywell.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went to call on Miss Wellwood, to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) name was no
slight recommendation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eagerly, asking after
Lady Morville, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) said, had twice written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) most
kindly about little Marianne.

<p/>It was a very pleasant visit, and a great relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked at
the plans, heard the fresh arrangements, admired, was interested,
and took pleasure in having something to tell Amabel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked
for Marianne, and heard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was one of the best of children --
amiable, well-disposed, only almost too sensitive. Miss Wellwood
said it was remarkable how deep an impression Sir Guy had made
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), and how affectionately she (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) kindness ;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>) distress at hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) death had been far beyond what
such a child could have been supposed to feel, both in violence
and in duration.

<p/>Philip asked to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wellwood</b></font>), knowing it would please Amabel, and in
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) came -- a long, thin, nine-year-old child, just grown into the
encumbering shyness, that is by no means one of the graces of la
vieillesse cle I ^enfance.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished to be kind and encouraging ; but melancholy, added
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) natural stateliness, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very formidable ; and poor
Marianne was capable of nothing beyond ' yes ' or ' no.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was going to see Lady Morville and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) little
girl, whereat she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) eagerly raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) eyes, then shrank in affright
at anything so tall, and so unlike Sir Guy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said the baby
was to be christened next Sunday, and Miss Wellwood helped
him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) out by asking the name.

<p/>' Mary,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was by no means inclined to explain the
Verena, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) knew not half what it conveyed to Amabel.

<p/>Lastly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) asked if Marianne had any message ; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hung
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head, and whispered to Miss Wellwood, what proved to
be ' My love to dear little cousin Mary.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) promised to deliver it, and departed, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could
more easily unbend.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 411



<p/>CHAPTER XL

<p/>Blest, though every tear that falls
Doth in its silence of past sorrow tell,
And makes a meeting seem most like a dear farewell.

<p/>Wordsworth

<p/>On Saturday afternoon, about half -past five, Philip Morville
found himself driving up to the well-known front door of
Hollywell. At the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) heard that every one was out
excepting Lady Morville, who never came down till the evening,
save for a drive in the carriage.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) entered the drawing-room, and gazed on the scene where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had spent so many happy hours, only darkened by that one
evil spot, that had grown till it not only poisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) own mind,
but cast a gloom over that bright home.

<p/>All was as usual. Charles's sofa, little table, books, and
inkstand, the work-boxes on the table, the newspaper in Mr.
Edmonstone's old folds. Only the piano was closed, and an
accumulation of books on the hinge told how long it had iDeen
so ; and the plants in the bay window were brown and dry, not
as when they were Amabel's cherished nurslings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) remem-
bered Amabel's laughing face and abundant curls, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
carried in the camellia, and thought how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) guessed then
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) should be the destroyer of the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) young-
life. How should he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) -- a widow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) father's house --
or look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) fatherless child? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had
borne to come thither at all, and shrank at the thought that
this very evening, in a few hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) must see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>).

<p/>The outer door opened, there was a soft step, and Amabel stood
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), pale, quiet, and with a smile of welcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) bands
of hair looked glossy under her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) widow's cap, and the deep black
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) dress was relieved by the white robes of the babe that lay
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) pressed it in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would like just to see baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), in a
voice something like apology.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) arms to take it, for which Amy was by no
means prepared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not quite happy even in trusting it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister's arms, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had never before touched
an infant. But that was all nonsense, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would not vex
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) with showing any reluctance ; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) laid the little one on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) arm, and saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) great hand holding it most carefully ; but
the next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) turned abruptly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). Poor silly little
Amy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) heart beat not a little till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) turned back, restored the
babe, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) walked hastily to the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) saw that
two large tear-drops had fallen on the white folds of its mantle.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) did not speak ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guessed how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) must feel in thus
holding Guy's child, and, besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own tears would now flow



<p/>412 THE HEm OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>so easily that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) guard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sat down, settled
the little one on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knee, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) time to recover himself.

<p/>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) came and stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), saying, in a most decided
tone, <div class="bookquote">``Amabel, you must let me do this child justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) looked up, wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) could mean.

<p/>' I will not delay in taking steps for restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) inheritance,''
said he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), hoping by determination to overpower Amabel, and
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) believe it a settled and a right thing.

<p/>' O Philip, you are not thinking of that ! '

<p/>*It is to be done.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not be so unkind to this poor little girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said
Amy, with a persuasive smile, partaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) old playfulness ;
adding, very much in earnest, <div class="bookquote">``Pray put it out of your head
directly, for it would be very wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse knocked at the door to fetch the baby, as Amabel
had desired. When this interruption was over, Philip came and
sat down opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), and began with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) most decided
manner : --

<p/>' You must listen to me. Amy, and not allow any scruples to
prevent you from permitting your cliild to be restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) just
rights. You must see that the estate has come to me by circum-
stances such that no honest man can be justified in retaining it.
The entail was made to exclude females, only because of the old
Lady Granard. It is your duty to consent.''

<p/>' The property has always gone in the male line,'' replied Amabel.

<p/>' There never was such a state of things. Old Sir Guy could
never have thought of entailing it away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) own descendant
on a distant cousin. It would be wrong of me to profit by these
unforeseen contingencies, and you ought not, in justice to your
child, to object.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke so forcibly and decidedly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) must
have prevailed. But not one whit convinced, Amabel answered,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own gentle voice, but beginning with a business-like argu-
ment : -- ' Such a possibility was contemplated. It was all pro-
vided for in the marriage settlements. Indeed, I am afraid that,
as it is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) will be a great deal too rich. Besides, Philip, I am
sure this is exactly what Guy would have chosen,'' and the tears
rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eyes. ' The first thing that came into my head when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was born, was, that it was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) wished, that I sliould
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) for myself, and that you should take care of Bedclyffe,
I am certain now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) hoped it would be so. I know -- indeed
I do -- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took great pleasure in thinking of its being in
your hands, and of your going on with all he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) began. You can't
have forgotten how much lie left in your charge 1 If you were
to give it up, it would be against his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) desire ; and with that know-
ledge, how could I suffer it ? Then think what a misfortune to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), jDoor little thing, to be a great heiress, and how very bad for
PeclclyfFe to have no better a manager than me ! Oh, Philip, can
you not see it is best as it is, and just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wished ? '

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) almost groaned -- ' If you could guess what a burden it is.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 413

<p/>' Ah ! but you must carry it, not throw it down on such
hands as mine and that tiny baby's/ said she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), smiling.

<p/>' It would have been the same if it had been a boy.''

<p/>' Yes ; then I must have done the best I could, and there would
have been an end to look to, but I am so glad to be spared.
And you are so fit for it, and will make it turn to so much use
to every one.''

<p/>' I don't feel as if I should ever be of use to any one,'' said
Philip, in a tone of complete dejection.

<p/>' Your head is aching,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), kindly.

<p/>' It alwayo does, more or less,'' replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), resting it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand.

<p/>' I am so sorry. Has it been so ever since you were ill 1 But
you are better 1 You look better than when I saw you last.''

<p/>' I am better on the whole, but I doubt whether I shall ever
be as strong as I used to be. That ought to make me hesitate,
even if -- ' then came a pause, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face,
and seemed struggling with irrepressible emotion ; and after all
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was obliged to take two walks to the window before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
recover composure, and could ask in a voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tried to
make calm and steady, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face was deeply flushed --
' Amy, how is Laura '? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Amabel. <div class="bookquote">``Only you must not
be taken by surprise if you see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looking thinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has trusted -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has endured through all ? ' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
with inquiring earnestness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oyes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>father mother</b></font>)</div><p/>' And they -- your father and mother -- can forgive ? '

<p/>' They do -- they have. But, Philip, it was one of the things
I came down to say to you. I don't think you must expect
papa to begin about it himself. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) does not like
awkwardness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will be very glad when once it is done,
and ready to meet you half way.'' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did not answer, and after
a silence Amabel added, <div class="bookquote">``Laura is out of doors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) and
Charlotte take very long walks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' And is she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) really strong and well, or is it that excited over-
doing of employment that I first set her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) upon?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) asked,
anxiously.

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) is perfectly well, and to be busy has been a great help to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>),'' said Amabel. <div class="bookquote">``It was a great comfort that we did not
know how ill you had been at Corfu, till the worst was over.
Eveleen only mentioned it when you were better. I was very
anxious, for I had some fears from the note that you sent by
Arnaud. I am very glad to see you safe here, for I have felt all
along that we forsook you ; but I could not help it.''

have been that you should have run any risk.''

<p/>once more, leant on the mantel-piece, scarcely knowing how to
face either of them -- his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt, with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) well-merited displeasure,
and Charles, who when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) parted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
so justly -- Charles, who had seen through him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and had been
treated with scorn.

<p/>A few moments, and Charles came in, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother.
They both shook hands, exclaimed at finding Amabel down-
stairs, and Mrs. Edmonstone asked after Philip's health in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
would-be cordial manner. The two ladies then went up-stairs
together, and thus ended that conference, in which both parties
had shown rare magnanimity, of which they were perfectly un-
conscious ; and perhaps the most remarkable part of all was
that Philip quietly gave up the great renunciation and so-called
sacrifice, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had been feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hopes, at the
simple bidding of the gentle-spoken Amabel -- not even telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) resigned it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) kept the possessions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
abhorred, and gave up the renunciation he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had longed to make ;
and in this lay the true sacrifice, the greater because the world
would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the gainer.

<p/>When the mother and daughter were gone, the cousins were
silent, Philip resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) elbow on the mantel-shelf and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand, and Charles sitting at the end of the sofa,
warming first one hand, then the other, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looked up
to the altered face, and perceived in it grief and humiliation
almost as plainly as illness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) keen eyes read that the sorrow
was indeed more deeply rooted than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had hitherto believed,
and that Amabel's pity had not been wasted ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was also
struck by the change from the great personal strength that
used to make nothing of lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole weight.

<p/>' I am sorry to see you so pulled down,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). ' We must
try if we can doctor you better than they did at St. Mildred's.
Are you getting on, do you think ? ' _

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had hardly ever spoken to Philip, so entirely without
either bitterness or sarcasm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) manner hardly seemed like
that of the same person.

<p/>' Thank you, I am growing stronger ; but as long as I cannot
get rid of this headache, I am good for nothing.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have had a long spell of illness indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles.
' You can't expect to shake off two fevers in no time. Now all
the anxiety is over, you will brighten like this house.''

<p/>' But tell me, what is thought of Amabel ? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as well as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ought to be ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite, they say -- has recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) strength very fast,
and is in just the right spirits. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was churched yesterday,
and was not the worse for it. It was a trial, for she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had not been
to East-hill since -- since last May.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is a blessing, indeed,'' said Philip, earnestly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) has been so very happy with the baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles.
' You hear what its name is to be ? '

<p/>' Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) told me in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) letter.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 415

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To avoid having to tell you here, I suppose. Mary is for
common wear, Verena is for ourselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) asked if it would be
too foolisli to give such a name, and mamma said tlie only
question was, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Verena</b></font>) would like indifferent people to ask
the reason of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip lapsed into thought, and presently said, abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``When
last we parted you told me I was malignant. You were right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' Shake hands ! ' was all Charles's reply, and no more was said
till Charles rose, saying it was time to dress. Philip was about
to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered, ' No, thank you, I am above trust-
ing to anything but my own crutches now ; I am proud to show
you what feats I can perform.''

<p/>Charles certainly did get on with less diflSiculty than heretofore,
but it was more because he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wanted to spare Philip fatigue than
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) disdained assistance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) chose to go alone.
Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) did what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had never done for any one before --
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) actually hopped the whole length of the passage, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
own door, to do the honours of Philip's room, and took a degree
of pains for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) comfort that seemed too marvellous to be true
in one who had hitherto only lived to be attended on.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had settled Philip, the rest of the party had
come home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) found himself wanted in the dressing-room,
to help his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mother to encourage his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) father to enter on the con-
versation with Philip in the evening, for poor Mr. Edmonstone
was in such a worry and perplexity, that the whole space till
the dinner-bell rang was insufficient to console him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in. Laura,
meanwhile, was with Amabel, who was trying to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
fluttering spirits and nerves, which, after having been so long
harassed, gave way entirely at the moment of meeting Philip
again. How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) after her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) weakness in betraying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for want of self-command ? Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) not be wishing to be
free of one who had so disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and only persisting in
the engagement from a sense of honour ! The confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
affection, which had hitherto sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), was failing ; and not
all Amabel could say would reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). No one could judge
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) but herself ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) words were so cautious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had so
much command over himself, that nobody could guess. Of course
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) felt bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) saw one trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) being only
influenced by honour and pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would release him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
should never see the struggle.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had worked herself up into almost a certainty that so it
would be, and Amabel was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would not be fit to go
down to dinner ; but the sound of the bell, and the necessity of
moving, seemed to restore the habit of external composure in a
moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) countenance, and left the room.

<p/>Charlotte, meantime, had been dressing alone, and raging
against Philip, declaring she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could never bear to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was Amy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would never have chosen him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) for a
godfather. And to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) marrying just like a good hero
in a book, and living very happy ever after ! To be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)



<p/>416 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>was sorry for poor Laura ; but it was all very wrong, and now
they would be rewarded ! How could Charlie be so provoking
as to talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) sorrow ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was sorry ; and as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) illness, it served him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) right.

<p/>All this Charlotte communicated to Bustle ; but Bustle had
heard some mysterious noise, and insisted on going to investigate
the cause ; and Charlotte, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own domain dark and
cold, and private conferences going on in Amabel's apartment
and the dressing-room, was fain to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) down-stairs, as
soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) toilet was complete, only hoping Philip would keep
out of the way.

<p/>But, behold, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was ; and even Bustle was propitiated,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) nose on Philip's knee, looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
face, and wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>) tail, while Philip stroked and patted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
and could hardly bear the appealing expression of tlie eyes, that,
always wistful, now seemed to every one to be looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
master.

<p/>To see this attention to Bustle won Charlotte over in a moment.
' How are you, Philip ? Good dog, dear old Bustle ! ' came in a
breath, and they were both making much of the dog, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
amicably asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had seen the baby, and became eager in
telling about the christening.

<p/>The dinner-bell brought every one down but Amabel. The
trembling hands of Philip and Laura met for a moment, and
they were in the dining-room.

<p/>Diligently and dutifully did Charles and Mrs. Edmonstone
keep up the conversation ; the latter about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) shopping, the
former about the acquaintances who had come to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sat in the carriage. As soon as possible, Mrs. Edmonstone
left the dining-room, then Laura flew up again to the dressing-
room, sank down on a footstool by Amabel's side, and exclaiming,
' O Amy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is looking so ill ! ' burst into a flood of tears.

<p/>The change had been a shock for which Laura had not been
prepared. Amy, who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) look so much worse, had not
thought of it, and it overcame Laura more than all her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) anxieties,
lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) love should be forfeited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sobbed inconsolably over
the alteration ; and it was long before Amabel could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to
hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face was much less thin now, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was alto-
gether much stronger ; it was fatigue and anxiety to-night, and
to-morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would be better. Laura proceeded to brood over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) altered demeanour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) settled melancholy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
not seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eye, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cold shake of the hand, all arose from the
diminution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) love, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dislike to be encumbered with
a weak, foolish wife, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had entangled himself when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) deemed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dwelt on all this in silence,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sister's feet, and Amy left her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to think, only
now and then giving some caress to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) hair or cheek, and at
each touch the desolate waste of life that poor Laura was un-
folding before herself was rendered less dreary by the thought,
' I have my sister still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knows sorrow too.'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) half



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 417

<p/>envied Amy, who had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) dearest by death, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
heart fast to the last ; not, like herself, doomed to see the love
decay for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had endured so long-- decay at tlie very
moment when the suspense was over.

<p/>Laura might justly have envied Amabel, though for another
reason ; it was because in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cup there was no poison of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
own infusing.

<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) stayed till Charlotte came to summon her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to tea, say-
ing the gentlemen, except Charles, were still in the dining-room.
They had remained sitting over the fire for a considerable space,
waiting for each other to begin, Mr. Edmonstone irresolute,
Philip striving to master his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings, and to prevent nicreasmg
pain and confusion from making him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) intended to
say At last, Mr. Edmonstone started up, pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) keys,
took a candle, and said, ' Come to the study-- I'll give you the
Redely fFe papers.''

<p/>' Thank you,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, also rising, but only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
not sit while his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) uncle stood. ' Not to-night, if you please. I
could not attend to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eh</b></font>)</div><p/>' What, your head 1 Eh ? ' , . , -r i

<p/>' Partly.<div class="bookquote">'' Besides, there is another subject on Avhich 1 hope
you will set me at rest before I can enter on any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes-- yes-- I know,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mr. Edmonstone, moving uneasily.
' I am perfectly conscious how deeply I have offended.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Edmonstone could not endure the apology.
' Well, well,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) broke in nervously, ' I know all that, and it
can't be helped. Say no more about it. Young people will be
foolish, and I have been young and in love myself.''

given in consideration of Mr. Edmonstone's having been young !
<div class="bookquote">``May I then consider myself as pardoned, and as having
obtained your sanction 1 '

<p/>' Yes, yes, yes ; and I hope it will cheer poor Laura up again
a little. Four years has it gone on ? Constancy, indeed ! and
it is time it should be rewarded. We little thought what you
were up to, so grave and demure as you both were. So you
won't have the papers to-night 1 I can't say you do look ht tor

<p/>Love-making was such a charming sight to Mr. Edmonstone,
that having once begun to look on Philip and Laura as a pair of
lovers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not help being delighted, and forgetting, as well
as forgiving, all that had been wrong.

<p/>Tliey did not, however, exactly answer his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ideas ; Laura did
not oiice look up, and Philip, instead of going boldly to take the
place next her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), sat down, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forehead, as it
too much overpowered by indisposition to think of anything else.
Such was in great measure the case ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was very much fatigued
with the journey, and these different agitating scenes had in-
creased the pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head to a violent degree ; besides which,
feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) aunt still regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did at Ivecoara.

<p/>E E



<p/>418 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not bear to make any demonstration towards Laura
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) might think it a sort of triumphant disregard
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) just displeasure.

<p/>Poor Laura saw in it both severe suffering and dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ;
and the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) understood from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father's manner what had
passed in the other room, the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for the
sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was making of himself.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone waited on the headache with painful atten-
tion, but they all felt that the only thing to be done for the two
poor things was to let them come to an explanation ; so Charlotte
was sent to bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mother went up to Amy, Charles carried
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father to the study, and they found themselves alone.

<p/>Laura held down her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face, and struggled to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) jjalpi-
tating heart and dry tongue suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to begin the words to
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had wound herself up. Philip raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes as the door shut, then rose up, and fixed them on Laura.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), too, looked up, as if to begin ; their eyes met, and they
understood all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stepjDed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands.
The next moment both hers were clasped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had bent
down and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brow.

<p/>No words of explanation passed between them. Laura knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own, and needed no assurance that her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) misgivings
had been vain. There was a start of extreme joy, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
had known twice before, but it could be only for a moment while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) looked so wretchedly unwell. It did but give her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) the right
to attend to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) said was to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to
lie down on the sofa ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) only care was to make liim comfort-
able with cushions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) Avas too entirely worn out to say any-
thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had intended, capable only of giving himself up to the
repose of knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) entirely his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own, and of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to
take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Tliere he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lay on the sofa, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes shut,
and Laura's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), neither of
them speaking ; and, excepting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hand,
neither moved when the others returned.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone compassionated him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), and showed a great
deal of solicitude about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), trying hard to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
used to do, yet unable to bring back the feeling, and therefore,
do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would, failing to wear its semblance.

<p/>Laura, sad, anxious, and restless, had no i-elief till she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went to
wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sister good night. Amabel, who was already in bed,
stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand with a sweet look, beaming with affection
and congratulation.

<p/>' You don't want to be convinced now that all is right ! ' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>).

<p/>' His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head is so dreadfully bad ! ' said Laura.

<p/>* Ah ! it will get better now his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind is at rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>' If it will but do so ! '

<p/>* And you know you must be happy to-morrow, because of baby.<div class="bookquote">''
' My dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>baby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in, ' I am sorry to

<p/>prevent your talk, but Amy must not be kept awake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) must
keej-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) strength for to-morrow.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 419

<p/>' Good night, then, dear, dear Laura. I am so glad your
trouble is over, and you have liim again ! ' whispered Amabel,
with lier parting kiss ; and Laura went away, better able to
hope, to pray, and to rest, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could have thought possible
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) left the drawing-room.

<p/>' Poor dear Laura,<div class="bookquote">'' said Mrs. Edmonstoiie, sighing ; * I hope
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will soon be better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Has it been very uncomfortable ? '

<p/>' I can't say much for it, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was suffering terribly
with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head, so that I should have been quite alarmed if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
had not said it was apt to get Avorse in the evening ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>),
poor thing, was only watching him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). However, it is a comfort
to have matters settled ; and papa and Charlie are well pleased
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>). But I must not keep you awake after driving Laura
away. You are not over-tired to-night, I hope, my dear ? '

<p/>' Oh, no ; only sleepy. Good night, dearest mamma.''

<p/>' Good nig-RSB- it, my own Amy ; ' then, as Amy jDut back the
coverings to show the little face nestled to sleep on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) bosom,
' good night, you little darling ! don't disturb your mamma. How
comfortable you look ! Good night, my dearest ! '

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone looked for a moment, while trying to check
the tears that came at the thought of the night, one brief year
ago, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) left Amy sleeping in the light of the Easter moon.
Yet the sense of peace and serenity that had then given especial
loveliness to the maiden's chamber on that night, was there still
with the young widow. It was dim lamplight now that beamed
on the portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband, casting on it the shade of the
little wooden cross in front, while she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was shaded by the white
curtains drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) bed round the infant's little cot, so as
to shut them both into the quiet twilight, where she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lay with
an expression of countenance that, thougli it was not sorrow,
made Mrs. Edmonstone more ready to weep than if it had been ;
so with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) last good night she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>).

<p/>And Amabel always liked to be shut in by herself, dearly as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) loved them all, and mamma especially ; there was always
something pleasant in being able to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own world,
to rest in the thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) husband, and in the possession
of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that
inner world of hers, the creature that was only his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and hers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) had from the first always felt herself less lonely when
quite alone, before with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) papers, and now with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) child ; and
could Mrs. Edmonstone have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) would have wei-RRB-t
and wondered more, as Amy fondled and hushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) babe, whis-
pering to it fond words Avhich she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could never have uttered in
the presence of any one who could understand them, and which
had much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) extreme youthf ulness in them. Not one was
so often repeated or so endearing as ' Guy's baby ! Guy's own
dear little girl ! ' It did not mean half so much when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called
it her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baby ; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved to tell the little one that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father
had been the best and the dearest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was gone away, and

<p/>would she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be contented to be loving and good with only her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
mother to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could, what
a father hers was, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was old enough to know about him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ?

<p/>To-night, Amy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) much in that soft, solemn, murmuring
tone, about what was to befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to-morrow, and the great
blessings to be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and how the poor little fatherless
one would be embraced in the arms of His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mercy, and received
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) great Father in heaven : -- ' Ay, and brought nearer to
your own papa, and know liim in some inner way, and lie will
know his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) little child then, for you will be as good and pure and
bright as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and you will belong to the great communion of
saints to-morrow, you precious little one, and be so much nearer
to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) as you will be so much better than I. Oh ! baby, if we
can but both endure to the end ! '

<p/>With such half-uttered words, Amabel Morville slept the
night before her (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) babe's christening.



<p/>CHAPTER XLI

<p/>A stranger's roof to hold thy head,

<p/>A stranger's foot thy grave to tread ;

<p/>Desert and rock, and Alp and sea.

<p/>Spreading between thy home and thee.-- Sewell

<p/>Mary Ross was eager for the first report from Hollywell the
next morning, and had some difficulty in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attention
fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) class at school. Laura and Charlotte came in
together in due time, and satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) so far as to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) that
Amy was very well.

<p/>' Is Captain Morville come ? ' thought Mary. ' No, I cannot
guess by Laura's impressive face. Never mind, Charles will
tell me all between services.''

<p/>The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) saw on coming out of school was the pony
carriage, with Charles and Captain Morville himself. Charlotte,
who was all excitement, had time to say, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister was
out of hearing, --

<p/>' It is all made up now, Mary, and I really am very sorry for
Philip.''

<p/>It was fortunate that Mary understood tlie amiable meaning
this speech was intended to convey, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to enter into
its grounds in the short conference after cliurch, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw
the alteration in the whole expression of countenance.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, who as usual remained at the vicarage
during the two services, and who perceived what passed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
mind, ' if it is any satisfaction to you to have a good opinion of
your fellow-sponsor, I assure you that I am converted to Amy's
opinion. I do believe the black dog is off his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) back for good and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I never saw any one more changed,'' said Mary.

<p/>' Regularly tamed,'' said Charles. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is something more like
liis old self to-dt'.y than last night, and yet not much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 421

<p/>perfectly overpowered then-- so knocked up tliat there was no
judging of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). To-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sedateness and scrupulous
attention, but all like a shadow of former time-- not a morsel of
sententiousness, and seeming positively grateful to be treated
in the old fashion.''

<p/>' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looks very thin and pale. Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recovered 1 '

<p/>' A good way from it,<div class="bookquote">'' said C'harles. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is pretty well to-day,
comparatively, though tliat obstinate headache hangs about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). If this change last longer than that and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) white looks,
I shall not even grudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the sponsorship Amy owed me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' Very magnanimous ! ' said Mary. ' Poor Laura ! I am glad
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) suspense is over. I wondered to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) at school.''

<p/>' They are very sad and sober lovers, and it is the best way of

<p/>not making themselves unbearable, considering Well, that

<p/>was a different matter. How little we should have believed it,
if any one had told us last year what would be the state of
affairs to-day. By the bye. Amy's godson is christened to-day.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you hear that the Ashfords managed to get Amy
asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would dislike their calling their boy by that name
we shall never hear again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was very much pleased, and
made offer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own pretty way to be godmotlier. I wonder
how Markham endures it ! I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) is nearly crazy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
wrote me word he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) should certainly have given up all concern

<p/>witli Redclyffe, but for the especial desire of . What a state

<p/>of mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) will be in, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) remembers how he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has been
abusing the captain to me ! '

<p/>The afternoon was fresh and clear, and there was a spring
brightness in the sunshine that Amabel took as a greeting to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little maiden, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was carried along the churchyard path.
Many an eye was bent on the mother and child, especially on
the slight form, unseen since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had last walked down the aisle,
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm linked in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bridegroom's.

<p/>' Little Amy Edmonstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they had scarcely learnt to cease
from calling lier, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was among tliem again, the widowed
Lady Morville ; and with those kind looks of compassion for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), were joined many affectionate mourning thoughts of the
young husband and father, lying far away in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) foreign grave,
and endeared by kindly remembrances to almost all present.
There was much of pity for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unconscious infant, and tears
were shed at the thought of what the wife must be suffering ;
but if the face could have been seen beneath the thick crape
folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) veil, it would have shown no tears -- only a sweet,
calm look of jDeace, and almost gladness.

<p/>The babe was on lier knees when the time for the christening
came ; she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) Avas awake, and now and then making a little sound,
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) was quieter with her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) than any one else, Amabel
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) might herself carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to the font.

<p/>It was deep, grave happiness to stand there, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cliild in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arms, and with an undefined sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was not alone, as



<p/>422 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>if in some manner her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband was present with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; praying
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) prayers, and joining in oflering up their treasure ; when
the babe was received into Mr. Ross's arms, and Amy, putting
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) veil, gazed up with a wistful but serene look.

<p/>' To her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) life's end 1 ' Therewith came a vision of the sunrise
at Recoara, and the more glorious dawn that had shone in Guy's
dying smile, and Amabel knew what would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) best prayer
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) little Mary Verena, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) back, the drops
glistening on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) brow, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eyes open, and arms outspread. It
was at that moment that Amabel was first thrilled with a look
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) child that was like its father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had earnestly and
often sought a resemblance without being able honestly to own
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) perceived any ; but now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) knew not in what
it consisted, tliere was something in that baby face that recalled
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more vividly than picture or memory.

<p/>' Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.''

<p/>Those words seemed to come from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had
brought Guy's daughter to be baptized, and completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) work
of pardon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had a yearning to be departing in peace,
whither her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sunshine was gone. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) not to
wish that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) child should be motherless ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had to train her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
to be lit to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). The sunshine was past, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had
plenty to do in the shade, and it was for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) sake. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would,
therefore, be content to remain to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) duties among the
dear ones to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had trusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) for comfort, and with the
sense of renewed communion with him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had found in
returning again to church.

<p/>So felt Amabel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) entered into the calm that followed
the one year in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had passed through the great
events of life, and known the chief joy and deepest grief that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could ever experience.

<p/>It was far otherwise with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sister. Laura's term of trouble
seemed to be ending, and the spring of life beginning to dawn
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>).

<p/>Doubt and fear were past ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) and Philip were secure of each
other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was pardoned, and they could be together without
apj-RRB-rehension, or playing tricks with their consciences ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
had as yet scarcely been able to spend any time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; and
as Charles said, their ways were far more grave and less lover-
like than would have seemed natural after their long separation.

<p/>In truth, romantic and uncalculating as their attachment
was, they never had been lover-like. They had never had any
fears or doubts ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) surrender of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) soul had been total, and
every thought, feeling, and judgment had taken its colour from
him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) as entirely as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had been a wife of many years' stand-
ing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) never opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mind to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had led
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to act wrongly, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) unhappiness had been from
anxiety for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), not repentance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own account ; for so
complete was her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) idolatry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) entirely overlooked lier
failure in duty to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) parents.



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 423

<p/>It took lier by surprise when, as they set out together that
evening to walk liome from East-hill, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) said, as soon as they
were apart from the village --

<p/>' Laura, you have more to forgive than all.''

<p/>' Don't speak so, Philip, pray don't. Do you think I would
not have borne far more unhappiness willingly for your sake 1
Is it not all forgotten as if it had not been ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not unliappiness I meant,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) replied, `though I cannot
bear to think of what you have undergone. Unhappiness enough
have I caused indeed. But I meant, that you have to forgive
the advantage I took of your reliance on me to lead you into
error, when you were too young to know what it amounted to.''

<p/>' It was not an engagement,'' faltered Laura.

<p/>' Laura, don't, for mercy's sake, recall my own hateful sophis-
tries,'' exclaimed Philip, as if unable to control the pain it gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; ' I have had enough of that from my sister ; ' then soften-
ing instantly : ' it was self-deceit ; a deception first of myself,
then of you. You had not experience enough to know whither
I was leading you, till I had involved you ; and when the sight
of death showed me the fallacy of the salve to my conscience, I
had nothing for it but to confess, and leave you to bear the
consequences. O Laura ! when I think of my conduct towards
you, it seems even worse than that towards -- towards your
brother-in-law ! '

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) low, stern tone of bitter suffering and self-reproach was
something new and frightful to Laura. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) arm
and tried to say -- ' O, don't speak in that way ! You know you
meant the best. You could not help being mistaken.''

<p/>' If I did know any such thing, Laura ! but the misery of per-
ceiving that my imagined anxiety for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) good, -- his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) good, indeed !
was but a cloak for my personal enmity-- you can little guess it.''

<p/>Laura tried to say that appearances were against Guy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
would not hear.

<p/>' If they were, I triumphed in them. I see now that a shade
of honest desire to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exculpated would have enabled me to
find the clue. If I had gone to St. Mildred's at once-- interro-
gated him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as a friend-- seen Wellwood-- but dwelling on the i/s
of the last two years can bring nothing but distraction,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) added,
pausing suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, ' that dear Guy himself was always
grateful to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) always upheld that you acted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good.
Oh ! the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) took it was the one comfort I had last year.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The acutest sting, and yet the only balm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>murmured Philip',
' see, Laura,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) opened the first leaf of Guy's prayer-book,
Avhich he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been using at the christening.

<p/>A whispered ' Dear Guy ! ' was the best answer she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could make^
and the tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was so very kind to me,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) saw me that unhappy wedding-day.''

<p/>' Did Amy tell you his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) last words to me ? '

<p/>' No,'' said Laura.



<p/>424 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' God bless you and my sister ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated, so low that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
could hardly hear.

<p/>' Amy left that for you to tell/ said Laura, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) tears streamed
fast. ' How can we speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), Philip ? '

<p/>' Only as an angel of pardon and peace ! ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) answered.

<p/>' I don't know how to tell you of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) kindness,<div class="bookquote">'' said Laura ;
' half tlie bitterness of it seemed to be over when once she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was
in the liouse again, and, all the winter, going into her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) room was
like going into some peaceful place wliere one must find comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' <div class="bookquote">``Spirits of peace, where are ye ! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could have said, when I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) drive away at Eecoara, and carry all good angels with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), except those that could not but hover round that grave.''

<p/>' How very sad it must have been ! Did -'

<p/>' Don't sjDeak of it ; don't ask me of it,<div class="bookquote">'' said Philip, hastily.
* There is nothing in my mind but a tumult of horror and dark-
ness that it is madness to remember. Tell me of yourself -- tell me
that you have not been hurt by all that I have brought on you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>' Oh, nc ! ' said Laura ; ' besides, that is all at an end.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At an end ! Laura, I fear in joining your fate to mine, you
will find care and grief by no means at an end. You must be
content to marry a saddened, remorseful man, broken down in
health and spirits, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole life embittered by that fatal remem-
brance, forced to endure an inheritance that seems to have come
like the prosperity of the wicked. Yet you are ready to take all
this ? Then, Laura, that precious, most precious love, that has
endured through all, will be the one drop of comfort through the
rest of my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could but hear such words with thrills of rejoicing affec-
tion ; and on they walked, Laura trembling and struck with
sorrow at the depth of repentance he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) now and then disclosed,
though not in the least able to fathom it, thinking it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
nobleness of mind, justifying liim to herself, idolizing liim too
much to own he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had ever been wrong ; yet the innate jDOwer of
tact and sympathy teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) no longer to combat his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) self-
reproaches, and repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) former excuses, but ratlier to say some-
thing soothing and caressing, or jDut in some note of tliankfulness
and admiration of Amy and Guy. Tliis was the best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
could do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was not capable, like Amy, of acknow-
ledging that his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) repentance was well-founded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was a nurse,
not a physician, to the wounded spirit _; but a very good and
gentle nurse slie was, and the thorough enjoyment of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) affection
and sympathy, the opening into confidence, and tlie freedom from
doubt and suspense, were comforts that were doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) good
every hour.

<p/>The christening party consisted only of the Rosses, and Dr.
May erne, who had joined them at East-hill church, and walked
home with Mr. Edmonstone. They could not have been witliout
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), so grateful were they for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) kindness all tln-ough their
anxious winter, and Mr. Edmonstone was well pleased to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
on the way home that they might look to having a wedding in



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 425

<p/>the family ; it had been a very long attachment, constancy as
good as a story, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) could all along have told what was the
matter, when mamma was calling in the doctor to account for
Laura's looking pale.

<p/>The doctor was not surprised at the news, for perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), too,
had had some private theory about those pale looks ; but know-
ing pretty well the sentiments Charles had entertained the winter
before last, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was curious to find out how he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) regarded this en-
gagement. Charles spoke of it in the most ready cordial way.
' Well, doctor, so you have heard our news ! I flatter myself we
have as tall and handsome a pair of lovers to exhibit here, as any
in the United Kingdom, when we have fattened him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a little into
condition.''

<p/>' Never was there a better match,'' said Dr. Mayerne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Made for each other all along. One could not see them
without feeling it was the first chapter of a novel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mrs. Edmonstone came in, the doctor was a little taken
aback. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) mind must be with poor Sir Guy, and
was afraid the lovers had been in such haste as to pain Lady
Morville ; for there was a staidness and want of epanchemeiit du
coeur of answering that was very unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) usual warm manner.
At dinner, Mr. Edmonstone was in high spirits, delighted at Amy's
recovery, happy to have a young man about the house again,
charmed to see two lovers together, pleased that Laura should be
mistress of Kedclyffe, since it could not belong to Amy's child ;
altogether, as joyous as ever. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife, being at ease about Amy,
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) best to smile, and even laugh, though sad at heart all the
time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) missed the father from the christening feast, and
thought how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had been in that far different reunion last
year. It might be the same with Charles ; but the outward efl-RSB-ect
was exhibited in lively nonsense ; Charlotte's spirits were rising
fast, and only Philip and Laura themselves were grave and silent,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), the more so, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was disappointed to find that the
one walk back from East-hill, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had enjoyed it, had
greatly tired Philip. However, the others talked enough without
them ; and Mr. Edmonstone was very happy, drinking the health
of Miss Morville, and himself carrying a bit of the christening
cake to the mamma in the drawing-room.

<p/>There sat Amabel by the fire, knowing that from henceforth
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) must exert herself to take part in the clieerfulness of the
house, and willing to join the external rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) child's
christening, or at least not to damp it by remaining up-stairs.
Yet any one but Mr. Edmonstone would have seen more sadness
than pleasure in the sweet smile with which slie met and thanked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) ; but they were cheerful tones in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) replied, and in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) presence everything was hushed and gentle, subdued, yet not
mournful. The spirit of that evening was only recognized after
it was past, and then it ever grew fairer and sweeter in recollec-
tion, so as never to be forgotten by any of those who shared it.

St. Mildred's, finding that, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) strength returned, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) mind
and memory regained their tone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was as capable as ever
of applying to business, and, above all, mucli settled and
comforted by some long conversations witli Mr. Ross.

<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) could not endure the thought of being at RedclyfFe.
The business connected with it was always performed with pain
and dislike, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) shrank with suffering at every casual mention
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) going thither. Mrs. Edmonstone iDegan to wonder whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) could mean to linger at Hollywell all the summer, and Amabel
had some fears that it would end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) neglecting Redclyfie, till
a letter arrived from Lord Thorndale, saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brother,
the member for Moorworth, had long been thinking of giving up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seat, and latterly had only waited in hopes that the succession
at Redclyfie might come to Philip Morville. Moorworth was
entirely under the Thorndale and Morville interest, and Lord
Thorndale wrote to propose that Philip should come forward at
once, inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to Thorndale instead of going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own
empty house.

<p/>To be in parliament had been one of the favourite visions of
Philip's youth, and for that very reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) liesitated, taking it
as one of the strange fulfilments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) desires that had become
punishments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could not but feel that as this unhappy load
of wealth had descended on him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was bound to make it as
beneficial as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could to otliers, and not seeking for rest or
luxury, to stand in the gap where every good man and true was
needed. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old love of distinction. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
disliked a London life for Laura, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that, precarious
as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) health liad become, it might expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to mucli anxiety,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was determined that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undertook it at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
never be an idle member.

<p/>It ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) referring the decision to Laura, who, disliking
London, fearful for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) health, eager for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glory, and reluctant
to keep back such a champion from the battle, was much per-
plexed, only desirous to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished, yet not able to make



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 427

<p/>out what that might be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) doubts to Charles and
Amabel, who both pronounced that the thought of going to
Redclyffe seemed far worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) than any degree of employ-
ment -- that occupation of the mind was the best thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
spirits ; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should
be consulted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was of the same opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said a man could hardly
have two fevers following, and one of them upon the brain, with-
out having reason to remember them. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) constitution had
been seriously weakened, and there was an excitability of brain
and nerves which made care requisite ; but depression of spirits
was tlie chief thing to guard against, and a London life, provided
lie did not overwork himself, was better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) than solitude
at Redclyffe.

<p/>Accordingly Philip went to Thorndale, and was returned for
Moorworth without opposition, Markham sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) nephew to
transact business with him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) at Thorndale, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could not bear
to meet liim himself, and while there was any prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
coming to Redclyffe, walked about in paroxysms of grunting and
ill-liumour. Tlie report that Mr. Morville was engaged to the
other Miss Edmonstone did but render him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) more furious, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)
regarded it as a sort of outrage to Lady Morville's feelings that
a courtship should be carried on in the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was
at i3resent the object of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) devoted affection for the family,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would not believe, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had been as mucli disap-
pointed at the birtli of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) daughter, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) was himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) would
not say one word against Mr. Morville, but looked and growled
enough to make Mr. Ashford afraid that the new squire would
lind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) very troublesome.

<p/>The Ashfords were in a state of mind themselves to think that
Mr. Morville ought to be everything excellent to make up for
succeeding Sir Guy ; but having a very liigh opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) to
begin v/ith, they were a' ery sorry to find all Redclyffe set against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). In common with the parish, they were very anxious for
the first report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) arrival, and at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) came. James
Thorndale, as before, drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) thither, coming to the Ashfords
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) was busy with Markham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) would not go up to the
Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) only went through some necessary business with Mark-
ham, and then walked down to the Cove, afterwards sitting for
about ten minutes in Mrs. Ashford's drawing-room.

<p/>The result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported
that the new squire took on as much about poor Sir Guy as any
one could do, and turned as pale as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been going into a
swoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) name and gave Ben his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) message. And
as to poor Ben, the old man said, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regularly did cry like a
child, and small blame to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to hear that Sir Guy had took
thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) at such a time and so far away ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) verily
believed Ben could never take again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) bad ways, after such
a message as that.

<p/>Markham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after,



<p/>428 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>and was even heard to mutter something about worshipping the
rising sun, an act of idolatry of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could not be accused,
since it was in the most grudging manner that lie allowed, that
Mr. Morville's sole anxiety seemed to be to continue all Sir Guy
had undertaken ; while Mrs. Ashford, on the other liand, was
much affected by the account her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) cousin James liad been giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) of the grief that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had suffered at Sir Guy's death, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
long illness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) loss of spirits, the reluctance he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) liad shown to
come here at all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) present unconquerable dread of going
to the Park.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was soon after in London, where, as far as could be judged
in such early days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) seemed likely to distinguish himself accord-
ing to tlie fondest hopes that Margaret or Laura could -ever have
entertained. Laura was only afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was overworking him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)-
self, especially as, having at present little command of ready
money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lived in a small lodging, kept no horse, and did not
enter into society ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was reassured wlien he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) came to
Hollywell for a day or two at Whitsuntide, not having indeed
regained flesh or colour, but apiDearing quite well, in better sj^irits,
and very eager about political affairs.

<p/>All would have been right that summer, but that, as Philip
observed, the first evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) arrival, Amabel was not looking
as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had done at the time of the christening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had,
just after it, tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) strength and spirits too much, and had
ever since been not exactly unwell, but sad and weary, more de-
jected than ever before, unable to bear the sight of flowers or the
sound of music, and evidently suffering much under the recur-
rence of the season, which had been that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) great happiness
-- the summer sunshine, the long evenings, the nightingale's
songs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was fatigued by the most trifling exertion, and
seemed able to take interest in nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) baby, and a
young widow in the village, who was in a decline ; and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was willing to do all that was asked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), it was in a weary,
melancholy manner, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had no joeace but in being allowed
to sit alone, drooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) child.

<p/>From society she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) especially shrunk, avoiding every chance of
meeting visitors, and distressed and harassed when her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) father
brought home some of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) casual dinner guests, and was vexed
not to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) come into the drawing-room in the evening. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) did make the effort of coming, to please him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was so sure
to be the worse for it, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother would keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) up-stairs
the next time, and try to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) from knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
father was put out, and declared it was nonsense to expect poor
Amy to get u^p her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spirits while she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) never saw a living soul, and
only sat moping in the dressing-room.

<p/>A large dinner-party did not interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), for even he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
could not expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to appear at it ; and one of these he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gave
during Philip's visit, for the pleasure of exhibiting such company
as the M.P, for Moorworth.

<p/>After dinner, Charlotte told Mary Ross to go and see Amy.



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 429

<p/>Not finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in the dressing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own
door. ' Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>answered the low soft voice ; and in the win-
dow, overhung by the long shoots of the roses, Amabel's close cap
and small head were seen against the deep-blue evening sky, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) sa.t in the summer twilight, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) little one asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) cot.

<p/>' Thank you for coming,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). ' I thought you would not
mind sitting here with baby and me. I have sent Anne out
walking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>' How pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looks ! ' said Mary, stooping over the infant.
' Sleep is giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) quite a colour ; and how fast she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) grows ! '

<p/>' Poor little woman ! ' said Amy, sighing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tired, Amy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div>said Mary, sitting down, and taking up the
little lambs wool shoe, that Amy had been knitting.

<p/>' N -- no, thank you,'' said Amy, with another sigh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are. You have been walking to Alice
Lamsden's again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>* I don't think that tires me. Indeed, I believe the truth is,''
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) voice sounded especially sad in the subdued tone in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spoke, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might not disturb the child, <div class="bookquote">``I am
not so much tired with what I do, which is little enough, as of
the long, long life that is before me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's heart was full, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not show her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought
otherwise than by a look towards the babe.

<p/>' Yes, poor little darling,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, ' I know there is double
quantity to be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), but I am so sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), when I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) must grow up witliout knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) has you, though,'' Mary could not help saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt
that Amabel was superior to all save her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband.

<p/>Perhaps Amy did not hear ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went up to the cot, and went
on : -- ' If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had but once seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had but had one kiss,
one touch that I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) of by and by, it would not seem
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was so very fatherless. Oh no, baby, I must wait, that
you may know something about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ; for no one else can tell you
so well what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, though I can't tell much ! ' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) presently
returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) seat. ' No, I don't believe I really wish I was
like poor Alice,<div class="bookquote">'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ; ' I hope not ; I am sure I don't for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
sake. But, Mary, I never knew till I was well again how much
I had reckoned on dying when slie was born. I did not think I
was wishing it, but it seemed likely, and I was obliged to arrange
things in case of it. Then somehow, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came back last spring,
after that sad winter, it seemed as if this spring, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)
would not come back to me, I might be going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Alice Lamsden/Alice</b></font>)</div><p/>' But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) comforted you.''

<p/>' Yes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did, my precious one ; I was so glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), it
was a sort of having liim again, and so it is still sometimes, and
will be more so, I dare say. I am very thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), indeed
I am ; and I hope I am not repining, for it does not signify after
all, in the end, if I am weary and lonely sometimes. I wisli I
was sure it was not wrong. I know I don't wish to alter things.''

<p/>' No, I am sure you don<div class="bookquote">``t.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>430 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>* Ah ! ' said Amabel, smiling, ' it is only the old, silly little Amy
that does feel such a heart-aching and longing for one glance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eye, or touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand, or sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) foot in the passage.
Oh, Mary, the worst of all is to wake up, after dreaming I have
heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice. There is nothing for it but to take our baby
and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) very tight.''

<p/>' Dearest Aniy ! But you are not blaming yourself for these
feelings. It might be wrong to indulge them and foster them ; but
while you struggle with them, they can't in themselves be wrong.''

<p/>' I hope not,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, pausing to think. ' Yes, I have ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the
joy <div class="bookquote">'' at the bottom still ; I know it is all quite right, and it came
straight from heaven, as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said. I can get happy very often
when I am by myself, or at church, with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ; it is only when I
miss his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bright outside and can't think myself into the inner
part, that it is so forlorn and dreary. I can do pretty well alone.
Only I wish I could help being so troublesome and disagreeable
to everybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, concluding in a matter-of-fact tone.

<p/>' My dear ! ' said Mary, almost laughing.

<p/>' It is so stupid of me to be always poorly, and making mamma
anxious when there's nothing the matter with me. And I know
I am a check on them down-stairs -- papa, and Charlotte, and all
-- they are very kind, considerate, and yet ' -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) paused -- ' and
it is a naughty feeling ; but when I feel all those dear kind eyes
watching me always, and wanting me to be happy, it is rather
oppressive, especially when I can't ; but if I try not to disajopoint
them, I do make such a bad hand of it, and am sure to break
down afterwards, and that grieves mamma all the more.''

<p/>' It will be better when this time of year is over,'' said Mary.

<p/>' Perhaps, yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>) always seemed to belong to summer days,
and to come with them. Well, I suppose trials always come in
a different shape from what one expects ; for I used to think I
could bear all the doom with him (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>), but I did not know it would
be without him (<font color='blue'><b>mamma</b></font>), and yet that is the best. Oh, baby ! '

<p/>' I should not liave come to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

<p/>' No -- never mind ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never settles fairly to sleep till we are
shut in by ourselves. Hush ! hush, darling -- No ? Will nothing
do but being taken up ? Well, then, there ! Come, and show
your godmamma what a black fringe tliose little wakeful eyes
are getting.''

<p/>And when Mary went downit was with the conviction that those
black eyelashes, too marked to be very pretty in so young a babe,
were more of a comfort to Amabel than anything she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) could say.

<p/>The evening Avore on, and at length Laura came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
sister's room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) looked fagged and harassed, the old face she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
used to wear in the time of disguise and secrecy. Amabel asked
if it had been a tiresome party.

<p/>' Yes -- no -- I don't know. Just like others,'' said Laura.

<p/>' You are tired, at any rate,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>You took too long
a ride with Philip. I saw you come in very late.''

<p/>* I am not in the least tired, thank you.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 431

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said Amabel. <div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
lieadaches again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' No,'' said Laura, still in a dissatisfied, uncomfortable tone.

<p/>' No ? Dear Laura, I am sure there is something wrong ; '
and with a little more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) winjiing, pleading kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
drew from Laura that Philip had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) idolized him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) so very gently and kindly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
idolized him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in a manner that was neither good for herself nor
him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) went on to blame himself for it, which was what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not bear. It had been rankling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mind ever since
that lie had found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) for loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so well, and it
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) very unhappy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) less, and
liow should she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) please him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had much rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had
blamed her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) than himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy, thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
has grown afraid of himself, and afraid of being admired now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' But how am I to help tliat. Amy ? ' said Laura, with tears in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) eyes : ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cannot help being the first, the very first of all
with me '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Amy, quickly, `not the very first, or what
would you do if you were to be -- like me ? Don't turn away,
dear Laura ; I don't think I ever could bear this at all, if dear
Guy had not kept it always before my eyes from the very first
that we were to look to something else besides each other.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course Imeant thefirst earthly thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura; butitwas
not heartfelt -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ought, therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>proceeded Amy, <div class="bookquote">``I think if that other is first, it
Avould make you have some other standard of riglit besides him (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)-
self ; then you would be a stay and help to him (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). I think that
is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Amy ! let me ask you,'' said Laura, a little entreatingly, yet
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) must needs put the question -- ' surely, you never thought
Guy had faults ? '

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) colour deepened. ' Yes, Laura,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) answered, firmly. <div class="bookquote">``I
could not have understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) repentance if I had not thought so.
And, dear Laura, if you will forgive me for saying it, it would
be much better for yourself and Philip if you would see the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I thought you forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),'' murmured Laura.

<p/>' Oh, Laura ! but does not that word <div class="bookquote">'' forgive ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>imj^ly some-
thing'? I could not have done anything to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) that
day, if I had not believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had something to be comforted for.
It can't be pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to see you think his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) rejientance vain.''

<p/>' It is noble and great.''

<p/>' But if it was not real, it would be throAvn away. Besides,
dear Laura, do let me say this for once. If you would l-RRB-ut un-
derstand tliatyou let him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) lead you into what was not right, and
be really sorry for that, and sliow mamma that you are, I do think
it would all begin much more happily when you are married.''

<p/>' I could never have told, till I was obliged to betray jnyself,''
said Laura. <div class="bookquote">``You know, Amy, it was no engagement. We



<p/>432 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>never wrote to each other, we had but one walk ; it was no
business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to speak till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could hope for papa's consent to
our marriage. It would have been all confusion if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had told,
and that would have been only that we liad always loved each
other with all our hearts, which every one knew before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yet, Laura, it was what preyed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
was dying.''

<p/>' Because it was the only thing like a fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could think of,<div class="bookquote">''
said Laura, excited by this shade of blame to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) vehe-
mently -- ' because his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) scruples are high and noble and generous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) spoke so eagerly, that the baby's voice again broke on
the conversation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was obliged to go away ; but though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) idolatry was complete, it did not seem to give full satisfaction
or repose. As to PJiilip, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was unchanged,
it now and then was felt, though not owned by him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
was not fully a helpmeet, only a ' Self ' ; not such a ' Self ' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
had left at St. Mildred's, but still reflecting on him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) former
character, instead of aiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) to a new one.

<p/>It had long been a promise that Mr. Edmonstone should take
Charlotte to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) grandmamma, in Ireland. They Avould
have gone last autumn, but for Guy's illness ; and now Aunt
Charlotte wrote to hasten the performance of the project. Lady
Mabel was very anxious to see them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) said ; and having
grown much more infirm of late, seemed to think it would be
the last meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) talked so much of Mrs.
Edmonstone and Laura, that it was plain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) wished ex-
tremely for a visit from them, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did not like to ask it,
in the present state of the family.

<p/>A special invitation was sent to Bustle ; indeed, Charles said
Charlotte could not have gone without his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) permission, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
reigned like a tyrant over her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), evidently believing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) created
for no purpose but to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and take him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to walk.

<p/>Laura was a great favourite at the cottage of Kilcoran, and
felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ought to offer to go. Philip fully agreed, and held out
some hopes of following as soon as the session was over, and lie
had been to Redclytie about some business that had been
deferred too long.

<p/>And now it apjDeared that Mr. Edmonstone had a great desire
to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) herself said, that under any other cir-
cumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sliould have been very desirous of going. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had not been to Ireland for fifteen years, and was sorry to have



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 433

<p/>seen so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother-in-law ; and now that it had been
proved that Charles could exist without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not
have hesitated to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), but for Amabel's state of health
and spirits, which made going from home out of the question.

<p/>Charles and Amabel did not think so. It was not to be
endured, that when grandmamma wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) should stay
at home for them without real nebessity ; besides, the fatigue,
anxiety, and sorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had undergone of late, had told on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>),
and had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) alter perceptibly, from being remarkably fresh
and youthful, to be somewhat aged ; and the change to a new
scene, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could not be distressing herself at every failure
in cheerfulness of poor Amy's, was just the thing to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) good.

<p/>Amabel was not afraid of the sole charge of Charles or of the
baby, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had been taught but too well to manage for herself ;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) understood Charles very well, and had too much quiet good
sense to be fanciful about lier very healthy baby. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
was inexperienced, with old nurse hard by, and Dr. May erne at
Broadstone, there was no fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) not having good counsel
enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was glad to be of some use, by enabling her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother
to leave Charles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) only fear was of being dull company for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was so kind as to bear it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) best,
and perhaps their neighbours would come and enliven him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
sometimes.

<p/>Charles threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) influence into the same scale. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) affection-
ate observation had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that it oppressed Amabel's spirits
to be the object of such constant solicitude, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was convinced
it would be better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), both to have some necessary occupa-
tion and to be free from that perpetual mournful watching of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother's that caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to make the efforts to be cheerful
which did her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) more harm than anything else.

<p/>To let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) alone to look and speak as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) pleased without the
fear of paining and disappointing those she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) loved, keep the house
quiet, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) the employment of household cares and attend-
ing on himself, was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought, the best thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was full of eagerness and pleasure at the very notion of being of
service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), if only by being good for nothing but to be waited
on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought privately that the spring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother's mind
had been so much injured by the grief she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had herself suffered
for ' her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son Guy,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cruel disappointment in Laura, and the
way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) threw herself into all Amy's affliction, that
there was a general depression in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) way of observing rnd
attending Amy, which did further harm ; and that to change the
current of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thoughts, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) home refreshed and
inspirited, would be the beginning of improvement in all. Or, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) expressed it to Dr. Mayerne, <div class="bookquote">``We shall set off on a new tack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>counsel mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) counsel and Mr. Edmonstone's wishes at length decided
mamma, on condition that Mary Ross and Dr. Mayerne would
promise to write on alternate weeks a full report, moral and
physical, as Charles called it. So in due time the goods were
packed, Mrs. Edmonstone cried heartily over the baby, advised

<p/>F F



<p/>434 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>Amabel endlessly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), and finally looked back through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) tears, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) drove away, to see Charles nodding and waving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hand at the bay-window, and Amabel standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
parting smile and good-bye on the steps.

<p/>The reports, moral and physical, proved that Charles had
judged wisely. Amabel was less languid as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had more cause
for exertion, and seemed relieved by the absence of noise and
hurry, spending more time down-stairs, and appearing less weary
in the evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) still avoided the garden ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) began to
like short drives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) brother in the pony-carriage, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) drove on in silence, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) lean back and gaze up into
the sky, or into the far distance, undisturbed. Now and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would be rejoiced by a bright, genuine smile, perfectly re-
freshing, at some of the pretty ways of the babe, a small but
plump and lively creature, beginning to grasp with her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) hands,
laugh and gaze about with eyes that gave promise of the peculiar
colour and brilliancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) father's. Amabel was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
might be tempted into giving Charles too much of the little
lady's society ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) with
an odd mixture of curiosity and amusement, much entertained
with watching what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) unaccountable manners, and
greatly flattered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could succeed in attracting her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) notice.
Indeed, the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked full at him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with a smile on the
verge of a laugh, it completely overcame him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), by the indescrib-
ably forcible manner in which it suddenly recalled the face wliich
had always shone on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) like a sunbeam. Above all, it was
worth anything to see the looks she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) awoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) mother, for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), even had she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) not been Guy's child.

<p/>In the evening, especially on Sunday, Amabel would sometimes
talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had never yet been able to do, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) last
summer's journey, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) stay at Recoara, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) way of
listening and answering had in it something that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) great
pleasure ; while, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) deemed each fresh word of Guy's
a sort of treasure for which to be grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). The brother
and sister were a great help and happiness to each other;
Amabel found herself restored to Charles, as Guy had liked to
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and Charles felt as if the old childish fancies were
fulfilled, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and Amy were always to keep house to-
gether. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was not in the least dull ; and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) good-
natured visitors in the morning were welcome, and received
with plenty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gay lively talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not by any means stand
in need of the compassion they felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and could have done
very well without them ; while the evenings alone with Amy
had in them something so pleasant that they were almost better
than those when Mr. Ross and Mary came to tea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) wrote
word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) mother that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might be quite at ease about them ;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) thought Amy would get through the anniversaries of
September better while the house was quiet, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) need
not thixik of trying to hurry home.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) was glad to have done so, for the letters, which scarcely



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 435

<p/>missed a day in being written by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) mother and Charlotte,
seemed to show that their stay was likely to be long. Lady Mabel
was more broken than they had expected, and claimed a long
visit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) was sure it would be, their last, while the Kilcoran
party had taken possession of Laura and Charlotte, as if they
never meant to let them go. Charlotte wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother very
full and very droll accounts of the Iricisms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
enjoyed thoroughly, and Charles, declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never exjDected to
see little Charlotte come out in the character of the facetious
correspondent, used to send Mary Ross into fits of laughing by
what he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>). Mr, Fielder, the tutor, wrote Charlotte,
was very nearly equal to Eveleen's description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>), but very
particularly agreeable, in fact, the only man who had any con-
versation, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had seen since she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had been at Kilcoran.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, `the imjDertinent little puss setting
up for intellectual conversation, forsooth ! '

<p/>' That's what comes of living with good company,'' said Mary.

<p/>The brother and sister used sometimes to drive to Broadstone
to fetch their letters by the second post.

<p/>' Charlotte, of course,'' said Charles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) opened one. ' My
Lady Morville, what's yours ? '

<p/>' Only Mr. Markham,'' said Amabel, ' about the winding up of
our business together, I suppose. What does Charlotte say 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Charlotte is in a fit of impudence, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) deserves
chastisement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles, unable to help laughing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read, --
' Our last event was a call from the fidus Achates, who, it seems,
can no longer wander up and down the Mediterranean without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pius ^Eneas, and so has left the army, and got a diplomatic
appointment somewhere in Germany. Lord Kilcoran has asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) to come and stay here, and Mabel and I are quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>)
comes for a purpose. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) has chosen this time, in order
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) may be able to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) companion before his (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) eyes, as
a model for courtship, and I wish I had you to help me look on
whenever Philip comes, as that laugh I must enjoy alone with
Bustle. However, when Philip will come we cannot think, for
we have heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) this age, not even Laura, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
is beginning to look very anxious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Do tell us if you
know anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). The last letter was when parlia-
ment was prorogued, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was going to RedclyfFe, at least
three weeks ago.''

<p/>' I wonder if Mr. Markham mentions him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, hastily
unfolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) letter, which was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) expected, about the
executors' business, but glancing on to the end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) exclaimed, --
' Ah ! here it is. Listen, Charlie. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Morville has been here
for the last few weeks, and is, I fear, very unwell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) has been
entirely confined to the house, almost ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) arrival, by
violent headache, which has completely disabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) from attend-
ing to business ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) will not call in any advice. I make a point
of going to see liim every day, though I believe my presence is

<p/>spirits, I cannot think it right that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) should be left to servants.''
Poor fellow ! Redclyfie has been too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>)/

<p/>' Over- worked, I suppose,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles. ' I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
coming it pretty strong these last few weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Not even writing to Laura ! How very bad he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must be ! I
will write at once to ask Mr. -RSB-\larkham for more particulars.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) did so, and on the third day they drove again to fetch the
answer. It was a much worse account. Mr. Morville was, said
Markham, suffering dreadfully from headache, and lay on the
sofa all day, almost unable to speak or move, but resolved
against having medical advice, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) own treatment of
himself did not at all succeed in relieving him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). There was ex-
treme depression of spirits, and an unwillingness to see any one.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) had positively refused to admit either Lord Thorndale or
Mr. Ashford, and would hardly bear to see Markham himself,
who, indeed, only forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) presence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) from thinking it
unfit to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) entirely to the servants, and would be much
relieved if some of Mr. Morville's friends were present to free
him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) from the responsibility.

<p/>' Hem ! ' said Charles. ' I can't say it sounds comfortable.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just as I feared!''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``Great excitability of

<p/>Charles was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if I could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) any good.''

<p/>' But, Amy,''-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) paused--' shall you like to see Eedclyffe ?

for you ? '

<p/>' I can't see how it should hurt w^e. But I forget, what is to
be done about your daughter ? '

<p/>' I don't know what harm it could do her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, consider-
ing. ' Mrs. Gresham brought a baby of only three months old
from Scotland the other day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gresham</b></font>) is six. It surely cannot

 (<font color='red'><b>Arnaud</b></font>)</div><p/>' Arnaud can manage for us. We would sleep in London, and
go on by an early train, and we can take our -- I mean my --
carriage, for the journey after the railroad. It would not be
too much for you. How soon could we go 1 '

<p/>' The sooner the better,'' said Charles. ' If we are to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
any good, it must be speedily, or it will be a case of shutting
the stable-door. Why not to-morrow ! '

<p/>The project was thoroughly discussed that evening, but still
with the feeling as if it could not be real, and when they parted
at night they said, -- ' We will see how the scheme looks in the
morning.''

<p/>Charles was still wondering whether it was a dream, when the
first thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heard in the court below his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) window was --

<p/>' Here, William, here's a note from my lady for you to take to
Dr. Mayerne.''

<p/>' They be none of them ill ? ' answered William's voice.

<p/>' O no ; my lady has been up this hour, and Mr, Charles has
rung his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) bell. Stop, William, my lady said you were to call at
Harris's and bring home a Bradshaw.^

<p/>Reality, indeed, thought Charles, marvelling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) elastic spirits throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) into the project with a sort of
enjoyment, partaking of the pleasure of being of use, the
spirit of enterprise, and the ' fun ' of starting independently on
an expedition unknown to all the family.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) met Amabel with a smile that showed both were deter-
mined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) undertook to announce the plan to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would write to tell Mr. Markham that as far as
could be reckoned on two such frail people, they would be at
RedclyfFe the next evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) must use his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) own discretion
about giving Mr. Morville the note which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enclosed.

<p/>Dr. Mayerne came in time for breakfast, and the letter from
Markham was at once given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).

<p/>' A baddish state of things, eh, doctor ? ' said Charles. ' Well,
what do you think this lady proposes'? To set off forthwith,
both of us, to take charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). What do you think of
that. Dr. Mayerne 1 '

<p/>' I should say it was the only chance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),'' said the doctor,
looking only at the latter. ' Spirits and health reacting on each
other, I see it plain enough. Over-worked in parliament, doing
nothing in moderation, going down to that gloomy old place-



<p/>438 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>dreaming away by himself, going just the right way to work
himself into another attack on the brain, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is done
for. I don't know that you could do a wiser thing than go
to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is no more fit to tell what is good for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) than
a child.'' So spoke the doctor, thinking only of the patient,
till looking up at the pair he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was dismissing to such a charge,
the helpless, crippled Charles, unable to cross the room without
crutches, and Amabel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) delicate face and fragile figure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
widow's mourning, looking like a thing to be pitied and nursed
with the tenderest care, with that young child, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) broke
off and said -- ' But you don't mean you are in earnest ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never more so in our lives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles; on which Dr.
Mayerne looked so wonderingly and inquiringly at Amabel, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) answered, -- -

<p/>' Yes, that we are, if you think it safe for Charles and baby.''

<p/>' Is there no one else to go ? What's become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister ? '

<p/>' That would never do,'' said Charles ; `that is not the question ; '
and lie detailed their plan.

<p/>' Well, I don't see why it should not succeed,<div class="bookquote">'' said the doctor,
' or how you can any of you damage yourselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' And baby 1 ' said Amy.

<p/>' What should happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), do you think ? ' said the doctor with
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) kind, reassuring roughness. ' Unless you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) behind
in the carriage, I don't see what harm she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) could come to, and
even then, if you direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) properly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will come safe to hand.''

<p/>Amabel smiled, and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to be inspected,
ran up-stairs with the light nimble step of former da,ys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There goes one of the smallest editions of the wonders of
the world ! ' said Charles, covering a sigh with a smile. ' You
don't think it will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) any harm 1 '

<p/>' Not if she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) wishes it. I have long thought a change, a break,
would be the best thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) -- poor child ! -- I should have
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) to the sea-side if you had been more movable, and
if I had not seen every fuss about her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) made it worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' That's what I call being a reasonable and valuable doctor,''
said Charles. <div class="bookquote">``If you had routed tlie poor little thing out to
the sea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) would have only pined the more. But suppose the
captain turns out too bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) management, for old ^larkham
seems in a proper taking V

<p/>' Hern ! No, I don't expect it is come to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be that as it may, I have a head, if nothing else, and some
one is wanted. Ill Avrite to you according as we find Philip.'' (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>_

<p/>The doctor was wanted for another private inter\4ew, in which
to assure Amabel that there was no danger for Charles, and then,
after promising to come to Eedclyffe if there was occasion, and
engaging to write and tell Mrs. Edmonstone they had his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) con-
sent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) departed to meet them by and by at the station, and
put Charles into the carriage.

<p/>A very busy morning followed ; Amabel arranged household
affairs as befitted the vice-queen ; took care that Charles's com-



<p/>The heir of redclyffe 439

<p/>forts were provided for ; wrote many a note ; herself took down
Guy's picture, and laid it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) box, before Anne commenced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) packing ; and lastly, walked down to the village to take
leave of Alice Lamsden.

<p/>Just as the last hues of sunset were fading, on the following
evening, Lady Morville and Charles Edmonstone were passing
from the moor into the wooded valley of Redclyffe. Since
leaving Moorworth not a word had passed. Charles sat earnestly
watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister ; though there was too much crape in the
way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was perfectly still, so that
all he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could judge by was the close, rigid clasping together of
the hands, resting on the sleejDing infant's white mantle. Each
spot recalled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) some description of Guy's, the church-tower,
the school with the two large new windows, the park wall, the
rising ground within. What was she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feeling ? He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) did not dare
to address her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), till, at the lodge-gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) exclaimed -- <div class="bookquote">``There's
Markham ; ' and, at the same time, was conscious of a feeling
between hope and fear, that this might after all be a fool's errand,
and a wonder how they and the master of the house would meet
if it turned out that they had taken fright without cause.

<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) exclamation. Amy leant forward, and beckoned. Mark-
ham came up to the window, and after the greeting on each side,
walked along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) hand on the door, as the carriage slowly
mounted the steep hill, answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) questions : ' How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' No better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) has been putting on leeches, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)-
self so giddy, that yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) could hardly stand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>' And they have not relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Not in the least. I am glad you are come, for it has been an
absurd way of going on.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Yes ; on the sofa in the library.''

<p/>' Did you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) my note ? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) expect us ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I went to see about telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) this morning, bat found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) so low and silent, I thought it was better not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) has not
opened a letter this week ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) might have refused to see you,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) did Lord Thorndale. Besides, I didn't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) would
take my writing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>), though if you had not written, I
believe I should have let Mrs. Henley know by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' There is an escape for him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>),'' murmured Charles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister.

<p/>' We have done the best in our power to receive you,'' proceeded
Markham ; ' I hope you will find it comfortable. Lady Morville,
but '

<p/>' Tliank you, I am not afraid,'' said Amy, smiling a little.

<p/>Markham's eye was on the little white bundle in lier lap, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) did not speak of it, and went on witli explanations about -RSB-Mrs.
Drew and Bolton and the sitting-room, and tea being ready.

<p/>Charles saw the great red pile of building rise dark, gloomy,
and haunted-looking before them. The house that should have
been Amabel's ! Guy's own beloved home ! How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) bear



<p/>440 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>it ? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was eagerly asking Markliam how Philip should be
informed of their arrival, and Markham was looking perplexed,
and saying, that to drive under the gateway, into the paved
court, would make a thundering sound, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) dreaded for Mr.
Morville. Could Mr. Charles Edmonstone cross the court on
foot ? Charles was ready to do so ; the carriage stopjDed, Amabel
gave the baby to Anne, saw Arnaud help Charles out; and
turning to Markham, said, ' I had better go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) at once.
Arnaud will show my brother the way.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sitting-room, Arnaud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Markham/Mr. Markham</b></font>)</div>said Markham, and walked on
fast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), while Charles thought how strange to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) thus
pass the threshold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) husband's house, come thither to relieve
and comfort his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enemy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) entered the dark-oak hall. On one side the light shone
cheerfully from the sitting-room, the other doors were all shut.
Markham hesitated, and stood reluctant.

<p/>' Yes, you had better tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) I am here,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), in the voice,
so gentle, that no one perceived its resolution.

<p/>Markham knocked at one of the high heavy doors, and softly
opened it. Amabel stood behind it, and looked into the room,
more than half dark, without a fire, and very large, gloomy, and
cheerless, in the gray autumn twilight, that just enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to
see the white pillows on the sofa, and Philip's figure stretched
out on it. Markham advanced, and stood doubtful for an instant,
then in extremity, began -- ' Hem ! Lady Morville is come,
and '

<p/>Without further delay she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) came forward, saying -- ' How are
you, Philip?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) neither moved nor seemed surprised, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only said, ' So you
are come to heap more coals on my head.''

<p/>A thrill of terror came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) did not show it, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) said, ' I am sorry to find you so poorly.''

<p/>It seemed as if before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) presence for a dream ;
for, entirely roused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exclaimed, in a tone of great surprise,
' Is it you. Amy 1 ' Then sitting up, ' Why 1 When did you come
here?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now. We were afraid you were ill, we heard a bad
account of you, so we have taken you by storm : Charles, your
goddaughter, and I, are come to pay you a visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Charles ! Charles here ? ' cried Philip, starting up. ' Where
is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ? ' _ _ ^

<p/>' Coming in,'' said Amy ; and Philip, intent only on hospitality,
hastened into the hall, and met him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) at the door, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
arm and conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) where the inviting light guided tliem to
the sitting-room. The full brightness of lamp and fire showed
the ashy paleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hair, rumpled with lying on
the sofa, had, on the temples, acquired a noticeable tint of gray ;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) whole countenance bore traces of terrible suffering ; and
Amabel thought tliat even at Recoara she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
look more wretchedly ill.



<p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 441

<p/>' How did you come ? ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) asked. ' It was very kind. I hope
you will be comfortable.''

<p/>' We have taken good care of ourselves,'' said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``I wrote
to Mr. Markham, for I thought you were not well enough to be
worried with preparations. We ought to beg your pardon for
breaking on you so unceremoniously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>' If any one should be at home here ' said Philip, earnestly ;

<p/>-- then interrupting himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes from the light,
' I don't know how to make you welcome enough. When did
you set off? '

<p/>' Yesterday afternoon,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' we slept in London, and
came on to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Have you dined ? ' said Philip, looking perplexed to know
where the dinner could come from.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes ; at K , thank you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' What will you have ? I'll ring for Mrs. Drew.''

<p/>' No, thank you ; don't tease yourself. Mrs. Drew will take
care of us. Never mind ; but how bad your head is ! ' said
Amabel, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sat down on the sofa, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) elbow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
knee, and pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hand very hard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forehead. ' You
must lie down and keep quiet, and never mind us. We only
want a little tea. I am just going to take ofi' my bonnet, and
see what they have done with baby, and then I'll come down.
Pray lie still till then. Mind he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) does, Charlie.''

<p/>They thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was gone ; but the next moment there she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
was with the two pillows from the library sofa, putting them
under Philip's head, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) comfortable ; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
overpowered by a fresh access of headache, had neither will nor
power to object. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) rang, asked for Mrs. Drew, and went.

<p/>Philip lay, with closed eyes, as if in severe pain : and Charles,
afraid to disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), sat feeling as if it was a dream. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
with Amy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) child, should be in Guy's home, so differently
from their old plans, so very differently from the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) should
have arrived. He (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) looked round the room, and everywhere knew
what Guy's taste had prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) bride -- piano, books, prints,
similarities to Holly well, all with a fresh new bridal effect, inex-
pressibly melancholy. They brought a thought of the bright
eye, sweet voice, light step, and merry whistle ; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said
to himself `gone for ever,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) could have hated Philip, but for
the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) haggard features, gray hairs, and the deep lines
which, at seven-and-twenty, sorrow had traced on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) brow.

<p/>At length Philip turned and looked up.

<p/>' Charles,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said, ' I trust you have not let her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) run any risk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' No : we got Dr. Mayerne's permission.''

<p/>' It is like all the rest,'' said Pliilij-RRB-, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) eyes again.
Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) asked : ' How did you know I was not well ? '

<p/>' Markham said something in a business letter that alarmed
Amy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) wrote to inquire, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) second letter we thought
we had better come and see after you ourselves.''

<p/>No more was said till Amabel returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had made some

<p/>stay up-stairs, talking to Mrs. Drew, who was bewildered between
suriDrise, joy, and grief ; looking to see that all was comfortable
in Charles's room, making arrangements for the child, and at
last relieving herself by a short space of calm, to feel where she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>)
was, realize that tliis was Redclytfe, and whisper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) little girl
that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) father's own home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) knew it was the room
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had destined for her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) tried, dark as it was, to see the view
of which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>), and looked up, over the mantel-piece,
at Miiller's engraving of St. John. Perhaps that was the hardest
time of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) trial, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) felt as if, without his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>)
arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) could never have held up under the sense of desolation
that came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>), left behind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) true home.
Left, she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) told herself, to finish the task he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had begun, and to
become fit to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) not in tlie midst of fulfilling
his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) last charge, that Philip should be taken care of ? It was no
time for giving way, and here was his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own little messenger of
comfort looking up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) sleepy eyes to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) so. Down
she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) must go, and put off ' thinking herself into hajDpiness,'' till
the peaceful time of rest ; and presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) softly re-entered the
sitting-room, bringing to both its inmates in her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) very presence
such solace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) little guessed, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) straightforward desire to
nurse Philip, and take care Charles was not made uncomfortable.

<p/>That stately house had probably never, since its foundation,
seen anything so home-like as Amabel making tea and waiting
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) two companions ; both she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) and Charles pleasing each
other by enjoying the meal, and Philip giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cup to be
filled again and again, and wondering why one person's tea
should taste so unlike another's.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was not equal to conversation, and Charles and Amabel
were both tired, so that tea was scarcely over before they parted
for the night ; and Amy, frightened at the height and slipperiness
of the dark-oak stairs, could not be at peace till she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) had seen
Arnaud help Charles safely up them, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) promise not
to come down witliout assistance in the morning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was in the sitting-room soon after nine next morning,
and found breakfast on one table, and Charles writing a letter on
the other.

<p/>' Well, said he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; ' all right with you and
little miss 1 '

<p/>' Quite, thank you. And are you rested ? '

<p/>' Slept like a top ; and what did you do ? Did you sleep like
a sensible woman ? '

<p/>' Pretty well, and baby was very good. Have you heard any-
thing of Philip T

<p/>' Bolton thinks him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) rather better, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is getting up.''

<p/>' How long have you been up 1 '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A long time. I told Arnaud to catch Markham when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>)
came up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) always does in a morning to see after Philip, and
I have had a conference with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and Bolton, so that I can lay
the case before Dr. Mayerne scientifically.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 443

<p/>' What do you think of it ?''

<p/>' I think we came at the right time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) lias been getting
more and more into work in London, taking no exercise, and so
was pretty well knocked iij-RRB- when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came here ; and this place
finished it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) tried to attend to business about the property,
but it always ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head growing so bad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had to leave
all to Markham, who, by the way, has been thoroughly propiti-
ated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) anxiety for him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) gave up entirely ; has
not been out of doors, written a note, nor seen a creature the last
fortnight, but there he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) has lain by himself in the library, given
up to all manner of dismal thoughts without a break.''

<p/>' How dreadful ! ' said Amabel, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eyes. ' Then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) would not see Mr. Ashford ? Surely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could have done
something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>).''

<p/>' I'll tell you what,'' said Charles, lowering liis voice, ' from what
Bolton says, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a dread of wor<div class="bookquote">``e than brain fever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) shuddered, and was jDaler, but did not speak.

<p/>' I believe,<div class="bookquote">'' continued Charles, ' that it is one half nervous and
the oppression of this place, and the other half, the over-straining
of a head that was already in a ticklish condition. I don't think
there was any real danger of more than such a fever as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had at
Corfu, which would probably have been the death of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; but I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dreaded still worse, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) horror of seeing any
one, or writing to Laura, arose from not knowing how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
could control his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' O ! I am glad we came,'' repeated Amabel, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) hands
together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has been doctoring himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>proceeded Charles; `and
probably has kept off the fever by strong measures, but, of
course, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) reduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) strength, the greater advantage
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gave to what was simply low spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) must have had a
terrible time of it, and where it would have ended I cannot
guess • but it seems to me that most likely, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is once
roused, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will come right again.''

<p/>Just as Charles had finished speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) came down, looking
extremely ill, weak, and suffering ; but calmed, and resting on that
entire dependence on Amabel winch had sprung up at Recoara.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) gloomy library, but
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lie on the sofa in the sitting-room, and sat there her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-
self, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thought a little quiet conversation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and
Charles would be the best thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wrote to Laura,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sent a message, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not yet attempt to write ;
and Charles wrote reports to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mother and Dr. Mayerne ; a
little talk now and then going on about family matters.

<p/>Amabel asked Philij-RRB- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) knew that Mr. Thorndale was at
Kilcoran.

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) said, ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) believed there was a letter f i-om him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>), but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) eyes had ached too much of late to read.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. x\shf ord sent in to ask whether Lady Morville would like
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). Amabel's face flushed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) proposed going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)

<p/>in the library ; but Philip, disliking Amy's absence more than
the sight of a visitor, begged she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) might come to the sitting-room.
The Ashfords had been surprised beyond measure at the
tidings that Lady Morville had actually come to EedclyfFe, and
had been very slow to believe it ; but when convinced by Mark-
ham's own testimony, Mrs. Ashford's first idea had been to go
and see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) could be any help to the poor young thing in that
great desolate house, whitlier Mrs. Ashford had not been since,
just a year ago, Markham had conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) to admire his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) pre-
parations. There was much anxiety, too, about Mr. Morville,
of whose condition Markham had been making a great mystery,
and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) return, Mr. Ashford was very eager for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) report.

<p/>Mr. Morville, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) said, did look and seem very far from well,
but Lady Morville had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) they hoped it was chiefly from
over fatigue, and tliat rest would soon restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>). J^ady Mor-
ville lierself was a fragile delicate creature, very sweet looking,
but so gentle and shrinking, apparently, that it gave the im-
pression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) having no character at all, not what Mrs.
Ashford would have expected Sir Guy to choose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) had
spoken very little, and the chief of the conversation had been
sustained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ashford</b></font>) brother. ^

<p/>' I was very much taken with that young Mr. Edmonstone,
said Mrs. Ashford ; ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) is about three-and-twenty, sadly crippled,
but with such a pleasing, animated face, and so extremely
agreeable and sensible, I do not wonder at Sir Guy's enthusiastic
way of talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). I could almost fancy it was admiration
of the brother transferred to the sister.''

<p/>' Then after all you are disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and don't lament,
like Markham, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not mistress here ? '

<p/>' No : I won't say I am disappointed ; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a very sweet crea-
ture, b yes, very ! but far too soft and helpless for such a
charge as this property, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father or brother to
help her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). But I must tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) baby,
a nice little lively thing, poor little dear ! and when we were
alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spoke rather more, begged me to send her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) godson to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), thanked me for coming, but crying stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from
saying more. I could grow very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). No, I don't
wonder at him (<font color='blue'><b>godson</b></font>), for there is a great charm in anything so soft
and dependent.'' . i i

<p/>Decidedly, Mary Ross had been right when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) said, that
except Sir Guy, there was no one so difficult to know as Amy.

<p/>In the afternoon, Charles insisted on Amabel's going out for
fresh air and exercise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) liked the idea of a solitary wander-
ing ; but Philip, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) surprise, offered to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>),
and' she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) was too glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) exert himself, to regret the
musings she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had hoped for ; so out they went, after opening the
window to give Charles what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) called an airing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) said,
that in addition he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should ' hirple about a little to explore tlie
ground-floor of the house.'' ^ -i-n, -i-

<p/>' We must contrive some way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to drive out, said Philip,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 445

<p/>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) crossed the court with Amabel ; ' and you too. There is
no walk liere, but up hill or down/

<p/>Up-hill they went, along the path leading up the green slope,
from which the salt wind blew refreshingly. In a few minutes,
Amabel found herself on a spot which thrilled -RSB-ier all over.

<p/>Tliere lay before lier Guy's own Redclyffe bay ; the waves
lifting tlieir crests and breaking, the surge resounding, the sea-
birds skimming round, the Shag Rock dark and rugged, the
scene which seemed above all the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) home affections,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had so longed to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), that it had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) an
effort on his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) death-bed to resign the hope ; the leaping waves
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) would not change for the white-headed moun-
tains. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) was lying among those southern mountains,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) stood in the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had loved to think of seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) ; and with Philip by her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sea, his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own dear sea,
the vision of which had cheered his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) last day, like the face of a
dear old friend ; his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sea, rippling and glancing on, unknowing
that the eyes that had loved it so well would gaze on it no more ;
the wind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had longed for to cool his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fevered brow, the
rock which had been like a playmate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) boyhood, and where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had perilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) life, and rescued so many. It was one of the
seasons when a whole gush of fresh perceptions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) feelings,
like a new meeting with himself, would come on her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) best of
joys ; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) stood, gazing fixedly, her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) black veil flutter-
ing in the wind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) hands pressed close together, till Philip,
little knowing what the sight was to her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>), shivered, saying it
was very cold and windy, and without hesitation she (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) turned
away, feeling that now Redclyffe was precious indeed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>) mind back to listen, while Philip was con-
sidering of means of taking Charles out of doors ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) supposed
there might be some vehicle about the place ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) thought
there was no horse. Very unlike was this to the exact Philip.
The great range of stables was before them, where the Morvilles
had been wont to lodge their horses as sumptuously as them-
selves, and Amabel proposed to go and see what they could find ;
but nothing was there but emptiness, till they came to a pony
in one stall, a goat in another, and one wheelbarrow in the
coach-house.

<p/>On leaving it, under the long-sheltered sunny wall, they came
in sight of a meeting between the baby taking the air in Anne's
arms, and Markham, who had been hovering about all day,
anxious to know how matters were going on. His (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) back was
towards them, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was unconscious of their approach,
and they saw how he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) spoke to Anne, looked fixedly at the child,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) laugh, and finally took her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) arms, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) had so
often carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father, studying earnestly her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) little face. As
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) saw them coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) hastily gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) back to Anne,
as if ashamed to be thus caught, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) was obliged to grunt and
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) hand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) shaggy eyelashes, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could answer
Amabel's greeting.



<p/>446 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) could hardly believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) eyes, that here was Mr. Morville,
who yesterday was scarcely able to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) head from the
pillow, and could attend to nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) could not think what
Lady Morville had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) inquiring
and making arrangements about sending for a pony carriage,
appearing thoroughly roused, and the dread of being seen or
sj-RRB-oken to entirely passed away. Markham was greatly rejoiced,
for Mr. Morville's illness, helplessness, and dependence upon
himself, had softened and won him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) kindly as
nothing else would have done ; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) heart was entirely gained
when, after they had wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) good-bye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markham</b></font>) saw Philip and
Amabel walk on, overtake Anne, Amy take the baby and hold
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up to Philip, who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) v/ith the same earnest inter-
est.. From thenceforward Markham knew that RedclyfFe was
nothing but a burden to Mr. Morville, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) could bear to see
it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) possession, since, like himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) seemed to regard Sir
Guy's daugliter like a disinherited princess.

<p/>This short walk fatigued Philip thoroughly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) slept till
dinner-time, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) awoke said it was the first refreshing
dreamless sleep he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had had for weeks. His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head was much
better, and at dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had something like an appetite.

<p/>It was altogether a day of refreshment, and so were the en-
suing ones. Each day Philip became stronger, and resumed
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) usual habits. From writing a few lines in Amabel's
daily letter to Laura, lie proceeded to tilling the envelope, and
from bein^ put to sleep by Charles's reading, to reading aloud
the whole evening himself. The pony carriage was set up, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) drove Charles out every day, Amabel being then released
from attending him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and free to enjoy herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) own way
in rambles about the house and park, and discoveries of the old
haunts she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) knew so well by description.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) early found her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) way to Guy's own room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would
walk up and down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arms, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>),
and holding up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), to be admired, the treasures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) boy-
hood, that Mrs. Drew delighted to keep in order. One day, when
alone in the sitting-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) thought of trying the piano he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>)
had chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>). It was locked, but the key was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) own
split-ring, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had put it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) returned
from London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) opened it, and it so happened, that the first
note she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) struck reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) of one of the peculiarly sweet and
deep tones of Guy's voice. It was like awaking its echo again,
and as it died away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) face and wept. But from that
time the first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) did when her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) brother and cousin were
out, was always to bring down her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) little girl, and play to her (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>),
watching how she (<font color='blue'><b>Drew</b></font>) enjoyed the music.

<p/>Little Mary prospered in the sea air, gained colour, took to
springing and laughing ; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) intelligent lively way of look-
ing about brought out continually more likeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father.
Amabel herself was no longer drooping and pining ; her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) step
grew light and elastic ; a shade of pink returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cheek,



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 447

<p/>and the length of walk she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could take was wonderful, consider-
ing her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) weakness in the summer. Every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) stood on the
cliff and looked at ' Guy's sea,'' before setting out to visit the
cottages, and hear the fond rough recollections of Sir Guy, or to
wander far away into the woods or on the moor, and find the way
to the places he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had loved. One day, when Philip and Charles
came in from a drive, they overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in the court, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cloak
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) arm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) crape limp with spray, her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) cheeks brightened
to a rosy glow by the wind, and a real smile as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked up to
them. When Charles was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sofa, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) stooped over him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and
whispered, ' James and Ben Robinson have taken me out to the
Shag ! '

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) saw Mr. Wellwood, and heard a good account of Coombe
Prior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) made great friends with the Ashfords, especially
little Lucy and the baby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) delighted in visits to the cottages,
and Charles every day wondered where was the drooping dejec-
tion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not shake off at home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would have
said that in Guy's own home, ' the joy ' had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), no longer
in fitful gleams and held by an effort for a moment, but steadily
brightening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) indeed, but tlie power of finding
rest in looking forward to meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), the pleasure of dwelling
on the days he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and the satisfaction of doing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) work for the present, had made a happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and still
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), quiet, grave, and subdued, but happiness likely to bloom
more and more brightly throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life. The anniversary
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) death was indeed a day of tears, but the tears were blessed
ones, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was more full of the feeling that had sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
on that morning, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been through all the year before.

<p/>Charles and Philip, meanwhile, proceeded excellently together,
each very anxious for the comfort of the other. Philip was a
good deal overwhelmed at first by the quantity of business on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) hands, and setting about it while his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head was still weak,
would have seriously hurt himself again, if Charles had not
come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) help, worked with a thorough good will, great
clearness and acuteness, and surprised Philip by his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cleverness
and perseverance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was elated at being of so much use ; and
begged to be considered for the future as Philip's private secre-
tary, to which the only objection was, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) handwriting was
as bad as Philip's was good ; but it was an arrangement so much
to the benefit of both parties, that it was gladly made. Philip
was very grateful for such valuable assistance ; and Charles
amused himself with triumphing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) importance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
should sit in state on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sofa at Hollywell, surrounded with
blue-books, getting up the statistics for some magnificent speech
of the honourable member for Moorworth.

<p/>In the meantime, Charles and Amabel saw no immediate
prospect of their party returning from Ireland, and thought it
best to remain at Redclyffe, since Philip had so much to do
there ; and besides, events were occurring at Kilcoran which
would have prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) visit, even without his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) illness.



<p/>448 THE HEIR OF EEDCLYFFE

<p/>One of the first drives that Charles and Philip took, after the
latter was equal to any exertion, was to_ Thorndale. There
Charles was much amused by the manner in which Philip was
received, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) himself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sake ; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) said to Amabel
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) return, there was no question now, that the blame of
spoiling Philip did not solely rest at Hollywell.

<p/>Finding only Lady Thorndale at home, and hearing that Lord
Thorndale was in the grounds, Philip went out to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>),
leaving Charles on the sofa, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) ladyship's care. Charles,
with a little exaggeration, professed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had never been so
flattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) whole life, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was by the compliments that
reflected on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as the future brother-in-law of Philip ; and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had really begun to think even Laura not half sensible enough
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own happiness. Lady Thorndale afterwards proceeded to
inquiries about the De Courcy family, especially Lady Eveleen ;
and Charles, enlightened by Charlotte, took delight in giving a
brilliant description of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) cousin's charms, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was
rewarded by very plain intimations of the purpose for which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) son James was gone to Kilcoran.

<p/>On talking the visit over, as they drove home, Charles asked
Philip if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had guessed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend's intentions. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you never took the credit of it. Why did you not
tell us?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I knew it from himself, in confidence.''

<p/>' Oh ! ' said Charles, amusing himself witli the notion of the
young man's dutifully asking the permission of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) companion,
unshaken in allegiance though the staff'' might be broken, and
the book drowned deeper than did ever plummet sound. Philip
spoke no more, and Charles would ask no more, for Philip's own
affairs of the kind were not such as to encourage talking of
other people's. No explanation was needed why he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should now
promote an attachment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had strongly disapproved
while James Thorndale was still in the army.

<p/>A day or two after, however, came a letter from Charlotte,
bringing further news, at which Charles was so amazed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
could not help communicating it at once to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) companions.

<p/>' So ! Eveleen won't liave him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed both.

<p/>' You don't mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has refused Thorndale ? ' said Philip.

<p/>' Even so ! ' said Charles. ' Charlotte says he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is gone. <div class="bookquote">'' Poor
Mr. Thorndale left us this morning, after a day of private con-
ferences, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) seems to have had no satisfaction, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>)
resolute dignity and determination to be agreeable all the
evening were'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- ahem-- <div class="bookquote">'' were great. Mabel cannot get at any
of the real reasons from Eveleen, though I think I could help
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>), but I can't tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>'

<p/>' Charlotte means mischief,'' said Charles, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) concluded.

<p/>' I am very sorry ! ' said Philip. ' I did think Lady Eveleen
would have been able to estimate Thorndale. It will be a great



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 449

<p/>disappointment -- the inclination has been of long standing.
Poor Thorndale ! '

<p/>' It would have been a very good thing for Eva/ said AmabeL
' Mr. Thorndale is such a sensible man.''

<p/>' j^nd I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorndale</b></font>) steady sense just what was wanting to
bring out all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) good qualities that are running to waste in that
irregular home,'' said Philip. ' What can have possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Ay ! something must have possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>),'' feaid Charles.
<div class="bookquote">``Eva was always ready to be fallen in iove with on the shortest
notice, and if there was not something prior in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) imagination,
Thorndale would not have had much difficulty. By the bye,

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip looked a little startled, but instantly reassuring himself,
said, --

<p/>' George Fielder ? Impossible ! You have never seen hira ! '

<p/>* Ah ! don't you remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) description ? ' said Amy, in a
low voice, rather sadly.

<p/>' The very reason, Amy,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles ; ' it showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
had attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) fancy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip smiled a little incredulously.

<p/>' Ay ! ' said Charles, ' you may smile, but you handsome men
can little appreciate the attractiveness of an interesting ugliness.
It is the way to be looked at in the end. Mark my words, it is
the tutor.''

<p/>' I hope not ! ' said Philip, as if shaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) coniklence. ' Any
way it is a bad affair. I am very much concerned for Thorndale.''

<p/>So sincerely concerned, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head began to ache in the
midst of some writing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was obliged to leave it to Charles
to finish, and go out to walk with Amy.

<p/>Amabel came in before him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and began to talk to Charles
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) great vexation at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) friend's disappointment.

<p/>' I am almost sorry you threw out that hint about Mr. Fielder,''
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>). ' Don't you remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fielder</b></font>) was recommended ? \

<p/>' Ah ! I had forgotten it was Philip's doing ; a bit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) spirit
of opposition,'' said Charles. ' Were not the boys to have gone
to Coombe Prior 1 '

<p/>' Yes,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, ' that is the thing that seems _to_ have
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) so unhappy about it. I ^m sure I hope it is not
true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) added, considering, ' for, Charlie, you must know that
Guy had an impression against him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>).''

<p/>' Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ? ' said Charles, anxiously.

<p/>' It was only an impression, nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of,
or mention to Lord Ivilcoran. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would have told no one but
me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had seen something of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at Oxford, and thought
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) full of conversation, very clever, only not the sort of talk
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) liked.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like that. Charlotte concurs in testifying to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
agreeableness ; and in the dearth of intellect, I should not
wonder at Eva's taking up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)._ He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would be a straw to
the drowning. It looks dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>G G



<p/>450 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>They were very anxious for further intelligence, but received
none, except that Philip had a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) friend, on which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only comment was a deep sigh, and ' Poor Thorndale ! She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)
little knows wliat she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) has thrown away ! ' Letters from Kilcoran
became rare ; Laura scarcely wrote at all to Philip, and though
Mrs. Edmonstone wrote as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) did not notice the subject ;
while Charlotte's gravity and constraint, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did achieve
a letter to Charles, were in such contrast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) usual free and
would-be satirical style, that such eyes as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother's could
hardly fail to see that something was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mind.

<p/>So it went on week after week, Charles and Amabel wondering
when they should ever have any notice to go home, and what
their family could be doing in Ireland. October had given place
to November, and more than a week of November had passed,
and here they still were, without anything like real tidings.

<p/>At last came a letter from Mrs. Edmonstone, which Amabel
could not read without one little cry of surprise and dismay, and
then had some difficulty in announcing its contents to Philip.

<p/>•Kilcoran, Nov. 6th.

<p/>' My deaeest Amy, -- You will be extremely surprised at what
I have to tell you, and no less grieved. ^ It lias been a most un-
pleasant, disgraceful business from beginning to end, and the
only comfort in it to us is the great discretion and firmness that
Charlotte has shown. I had better, however, begin at the be-
ginning, and tell you the history as far as I understand it myself.
You know that Mr. James Thorndale has been here, and perhaps
ycu know it was for the purpose of making an offer to Eveleen.
Every one was much surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and still more
when, after much prevarication, it came out that the true motive
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) attachment to Mr. Fielder, the tutor. It appeared that
they had been secretly engaged for some weeks, ever since they
had perceived Mr. Thorndale's intentions, and not, as it was in
poor Laura's case, an una vowed attachment, but an absolute en-
gagement. And fancy Eva justifying it by Laura's example 1
There was of course great anger and confusion. Lord Kilcoran
was furious, poor Lady Kilcoran had nervous attacks, the gentle-
man was dismissed from the house, and supposed to be gone to
England, Eva shed abundance of tears, but after a great deal of
vehemence she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) appeared subdued and submissive. We were all
very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), as there is much that is very agreeable and
likely to attract her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) in Mr. Fielder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) always had too much
mind to he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wasted in such a life as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) leads here. It seemed as
if Laura was a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and Lady Kilcoran was very anxious
we should st^y as long as possible. This was all^ about three
weeks or a month ago ; Eva was recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) spirits, and I was
just beginning a letter to tell you we hoped to be at home in
another week, when Charlotte came into my room in great dis-
tress to tell me that Eveleen and Mr. Fielder were on the verge
of a run-away marriage. Charlotte had been coming back alone



<p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 451

<p/>from a visit to grandmamma, and going down a path out of the
direct way to recall Bustle, who had run off, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bustle</b></font>)
scented mischief, came, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) great astonishment, on Eveleen
walking arm-in-arm with Mr. Fielder ! Charlie will fancy how
Charlotte looked at them ! They sliuffled, and tried to explain it
away, but Charlotte was too acute for them, or rather, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) held
steadily to <div class="bookquote">'' be that as it may. Lord Kilcoran ought to know it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They tried to frighten lier with the horrors of betraying secrets,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said none had been confided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and mamma would
judge. They tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) it Avas the way of all lovers,
and appealed to Laura's example, but there little Charlotte was
less to be shaken than on any point. <div class="bookquote">``I did not think them
worthy to hear their names,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) said to me, <div class="bookquote">'' but I told them,
that I had seen that the truest and deepest of love had a horror
of all that was like wrong, and as to Philip and Laura, they little
knew what they had suffered ; besides, theirs was not half so bad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I verily believe these were the very words she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) used to them. At
last Eva threw herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mercy, and begged so vehemently
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would only wait another day, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) suspected, and,
with sharpness very like Charlie's, forced from Eva that they were
to marry the next morning. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said it would be a great
deal better that they should abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) and call her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) a spy than do
what they would repent of all their lives; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) begged Eva's
pardon, and cried so much that Eva was in hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would relent,
and then came straight to me, very unhappy, and not in the least
triumphant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) discovery. You can guess what a di'eadful
afternoon we had, I don't think any one was more miserable than
poor Charlotte, who stayed shut up in my room all day, dreading
the sight of any one, and expecting to be unis^ersally called a
traitor. The end was, that after much storming, Lord Kilcoran,
finding Eveleen determined, and anxious to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) the discredit
of an elopement, has agreed to receive Mr. Fielder, and they are
to be married from this house on the 6th of December, though
what they are to live upon no one can guess. The Kilcorans are
very anxious to put the best face on the matter possible, and
have persuaded us, for the sake of the family, to stay for the
wedding ; indeed, poor Lady Kilcoran is so completely overcome,
that I hardly like to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) till this is over. How unpleasant
the state of things in the house is no one can imagine, and very,
very glad shall I be to get back to Hollywell and my Amy and
Charlie. Dearest Amy,

<p/>' Your most affectionate.

<p/>``L. Edmonstone/

<p/>The news was at length told, and Philip was indeed thunder-
struck at this fresh consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) interference. It threatened
at first to overthrow his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) scarcely recovered spirits, and but for
the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) guests, it seemed as if it might have brought
on a renewal of the state from which they had restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Charles to Amy, when they talked it over alone.

<p/>452 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>' It seems as if good people could do wrong with less impunity
than others. It is rather like the saying about fools and angels.
Light-minded people see the sin, but not the repentance, so they
imitate the one without being capable of the other. Here are
Philip and Laura finishing ofi<div class="bookquote">'' like the end of a novel, fortune and
all, and setting a very bad example to the world in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' As the world cannot see below the surface,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, ' how
distressed Laura must be ! You see, mamma does not say one
word about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div><p/>Philip had not much peace till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had written to Mr. Thorn-
dale, who was going at once to Germany, not liking to return
home to meet the condolences. Mrs. Edmonstone had nearly
the whole correspondence of the family on her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) hands ; for
neither of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) daughters liked to write, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) g&xe tiie descrip-
tion of the various uncomfortable scenes that took place. Lord
de Courcy's stern and enduring displeasure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Courcy</b></font>) father's fast
subsiding violence ; Lady Kilcoran's distress, and the younger
girls' excitement and amusement ; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) thought the
very proper and serious way in which Charlotte viewed it,
would keep it from doing them much harm, provided, as was
much to be feared. Lord Kilcoran did not end by keeping the
pair always at home, living upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kilcoran</b></font>) till Mr. Fielder could get
a situation. In fact, it was difficult to know what other means
there were of providing for them.

<p/>At last the wedding took place, and Mrs. Edmonstone wrote a
letter, divided between indignation at the foolish display that had
attended it, and satisfaction at being able at length to fix the
day for the meeting at Holly well. No one could giiess how she (<font color='blue'><b>Holly</b></font>)
longed to be at home again, and to be once more with Charlie.

<p/>Nor were Charles and Amabel less ready to go home, though
they could both truly say that they had much enjoyed their stay
at Redclyfi<div class="bookquote">``e. Philip was to come with them, and it was privately
agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) should return to Redclyfie no more till he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
bring Laura with liim. Amabel had talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) sister to Mrs.
Ashford, and done much to smooth the way ; and even on the
last day or two, held a few consultations with Philip, as to the
arrangements that Laura would like. One thing, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
must ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own pleasure. ' Philip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amabel/Miss Amabel</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>), ' you must
let me have this piano.''

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answer was by look and gesture.

<p/>' And I want very much to ask a question, Philip. Will you
tell me which is Sir Hugh's picture ? '

<p/>' You have been sitting opposite to it every day at dinner.''

<p/>' That ? ' exclaimed Amy. ' From what I heard, I fully ex-
pected to have known Sir Hugh's in a moment ; and I often
looked at that one, but I never could see more likeness than
there is in almost all the pictures about the house.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) went at once to study it again, and wondered more.

<p/>' I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) sometimes look like it ; but it is not at aU
the strong likeness I expected.''



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 453

<p/>Philip stood silently gazing, and certainly the countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
recalled, pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to desist from his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) wilfulness, and
bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) sickness, was far unlike in expression
to the fiery youth before him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). In a few moments more, Amabel
had run up-stairs, and brought down Mr. Shene's portrait.
There was proved to be more resemblance than either of them
had at first sight credited. The form of the forehead, nose, and
short upper lip were identical, so were the sharply-defined black
eyebrows, the colour of the eyes ; and the way of standing in
both had a curious similarity ; but the expression was so entirely
different, that strict comparison alone proved, that Guy's ani-
mated, contemplative, and most winning countenance, was in its
original lineaments entirely the same with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) ancestor.
Although Sir Hugh's was then far from unprepossessing, and bore
as yet no trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hugh</b></font>) unholy passions, it brought to Amabel's
mind the shudder with which Guy had mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) likeness to
that picture, and seemed to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) the nature he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) had tamed.

<p/>Philip, meanwhile, after one glance at Mr. Shene's portrait,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had not before seen, had turned away, and stood lean-
ing against the window-frame. When Amy had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
silent comparison, and was going to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) treasure back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
looked up, and said, ' Do you dislike leaving that with me for a
few minutes ? '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep it as long as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), going at once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) no more till nearly an hour after ; when, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was
coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) own room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>), and gave it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hands, saying nothing except a smothered ' Thank you ; ' but his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
eyelids were so swollen and heavy, that Charles feared his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head
was bad again, while Amy was glad to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had had
the comfort of tears.

<p/>Every one was sorry to wish Lady Morville and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morville</b></font>) brother
good-bye, only consoling themselves with hoping that their
sister might be like them ; and as to little Mary, the attention
paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was so devoted and universal, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mamma
thought it very Avell she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should receive the first ardour of it
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was too young to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head turned.

<p/>Tliey again slept a night in London, and in the morning Philip
took Charles for a drive through the places he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had heard of, and
was much edified by actually beholding. They were safely at
home the same evening, and on the following, the Hollywell
party was once more complete, gathered round Charles's sofa in
a confusion of welcomes and greetings.

<p/>Mrs. Edmonstone could hardly believe lier eyes, so much had
Charles's countenance lost its invalid look, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) movements
were so much more active ; Amabel, too, though still white and
thin, had a life in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) eye and an air of health most unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
languor and dej^ression.

<p/>Every one looked well and happy but Laura, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had a
worn, faded, harassed aspect, which was not cheered even by
Philip's presence ; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) seemed almost to shrink from



<p/>454 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>speaking to liim. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was the only silent one of the party that
evening, as they gathered round the dinner or tea-table, or sat
divided into threes or pairs, talking over the subjects that would
not do to be discussed in public. Charlotte generally niched into
Amy's old corner by Charles, hearing about Redclyife, or telling
about Ireland. Mrs. Edmonstone and Amy on the opposite sides
of the ottoman, their heads meeting over the central cushion,
talking in low, fond, inaudible tones ; Mr. Edmonstone going in
and out of the room, and joining himself to one or other •proup,
telling and hearing news, and sometimes breaking up the pairs ;
and then Mrs. Edmonstone came to congratulate Charles on
Amy's improved looks, or Charlotte pressed up close to Amy to
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) about grandmamma. For Charlotte could not talk about
Eveleen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had been so uncomfortable at the part she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) had had
to act, that all the commendation she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) received was only like pain
and shame, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) mother was by no means dissatisfied that it
should be so, since a degree of forwardness had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveleen</b></font>) chief
cause of anxiety in Charlotte ; and it now appeared that without
losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) high spirit and uncompromising sense of right, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
sixteenth year was bringing with it feminine reserve.

<p/>Laura lingered late in Amabel's room, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother
had wished them good night, and left them together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) ex-
claimed, ' Oh, Amy ! I am so glad to be come back to you. I
have been so very miserable ! '

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is quite well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``We think him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
looking better than in the summer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' O yes ! Oh, Amy, what have you not done 1 If you could
guess the relief of hearing you were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), after that sus-
pense ! ' But as if losing that subject in one she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) was still more
eager about, ' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) think of me ? '

<p/>' My dear,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amabel, ' I don't tliink I am the right person
to tell you that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' You saw how it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) lieard of my share in it.''

<p/>* Yours ? Mamma never mentioned you.''

<p/>* Always kind ! ' said Laura. ' Oh, Amy ! what will you think
of me when I tell I knew poor Eva's secret all the time ? Wliat
could I do, when Eva pleaded my own case ? It was very
different, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would not see it, and I felt as if I was guilty
of all. Oh, how I envied Charlotte.''

<p/>' Dear Laura, no wonder you were unhappy ! '

<p/>' Nothing hitherto has been equal to it ! ' said Laura. ' There
was the misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) silence, and the anxiety that you, dearest,
freed me from ; then no sooner was that over tlian this was
confided to me. Think what I felt when Eva put me in mind
of a time when I argued in favour of some such concealment
in a novel ! No, you can never guess what I went through,
knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would think me weak, blameable, unAvorthy ! '

<p/>' Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) blames himself too much to blame you.''

<p/>' No, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must not do ! It was my fault from the
beginning. If I had but gone at once to mamma ! '



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 455

<p/>* Oh, I am so glad ! ' exclaimed Amy, suddenly.

<p/>``Gladr

<p/>' I mean,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, looking down, ' now you have said that,
I am sure you will be happier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Happier, now I feel and see how I have lowered myself even
in liis siglit ? ' said Laura, drooping her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) head and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) face
in lier hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went on in so low a tone that Amy could
hardly hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). ' I know it all now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) loves me still, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
must whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) has once taken into that deep, deep heart of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) : he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) will always ; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) cannot have that honouring, trust-
ing, confiding love that -- you enjoyed and deserved. Amy -- that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would have had if I had cared first for what became me. If I
had only at first told mamma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would not even have been
blamed ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would have been spared lialf this sujEfering and
self-reproach ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) would have loved me more ; Eva might not
have been led astray ; at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) could not have laid it to my
charge, -- and I could lift up my head,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) finished, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hung
it almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) knees.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sister raised the head, laid it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) own bosom, and
kissed the cheeks and brow again and again. ' Dearest, dearest
Laura, I am so sorry for you ; but I am sure you must feel freer
and happier now you know it all, and see the truth.''

<p/>' I don't know ! ' said Laura, sadly.

<p/>' And at least you will be better able to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

<p/>``No, no, I shall only add to his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) self-reproach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will see
more jDlainly what a wretched weak creature he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fancied had firm-
ness and discretion. Oh, what a broken reed I have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) ! '

<p/>' There is strength and comfort for us all to lean upon,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Amy. ' But you ought to go to bed. Shall I read to you, Laura ?
you are so tired, I should like to come and read you to sleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura was not given to concealments ; that fatal one had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) only insincerity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) never thought of doing other-
wise than telling the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) conduct in Ireland to Philip.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) sat alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the next morning, explained all, and
entreated his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) pardon, humiliating herself so much, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) could
not bear to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>' It was the fault of our whole lifetime, Laura,<div class="bookquote">'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), recover-
ing himself, when a few agitated words had passed on either side.
* I taught you to take my dictum for law, and abused your trust,
and perverted all the best and most precious qualities. It is I who
stand first to bear the blame, and would that I could bear all the
suffering ! But as it is, Laura, we must look to enduring the con-
sequence all our lives, and give each other what support we may.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>Laura could hardly brook liis self -accusation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) could no
longer argue the point ; and there was far more peace and truth
b-RRB-efore them than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) infallible, and therefore
justified herself for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had done in blind obedience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>).

<p/>CHAPTER XLIV

<p/>Thus souls by nature pitched too high,

<p/>By sufferings plunged too low,
Meet in the church's middle sky,

<p/>Halfway `twixt joy and woe ;

<p/>To practise there the soothing lay,

<p/>That sorrow best relieves,
Thankful for all God takes away,

<p/>Humbled by all He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gives. -- Christian Year

<p/>One afternoon, late in April, Charles opened the dressing-room
door, and paused a moment, smiling. There sat Amabel on the
floor before the fire, her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand stretched out, playfully holding back
the little one, who, with scanty, flossy, silken curls, hazel eyes and
jet-black lashes, plump, mottled arms, and tiny tottering feet,
stood crowing and shouting in exulting laughter, having just
made a triumphant clutch at her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mamma's hair, and pulled
down all the light, shining locks, while under their shade the
reddening, smiling face recalled the Amy of days long gone by.

<p/>' That's right ! ' cried Charles, delighted, ' pull it all down.
Out with mamma's own curls again ! '

<p/>' No ; I can never wear my curls again,'' said Amy, so mourn-
fully, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had referred to them ; and j^erceiving
this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) smiled sweetly, and pulling a tress to its full length,
showed how much too short it was for anything but being put
plainly under the cap, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) restored it.

<p/>' Is Mrs. Henley come 1 ' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) asked.

<p/>' As large as lite, and that is saying a good deal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) would
make two of Philip. As tall and twice as broad. I thought
Juno herself was advancing on me from the station.''

<p/>' How did you get on Avith her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) ? '

<p/>' Famously ; I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) all about everything, and how the
affair is to be really quiet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) had never believed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
could hardly believe my word, when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) there was to be
absolutely no one but ourselves and Mary Ross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) supposed
it was for your sake, and I did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) it was for their owtu
It really was providential that the Kilcoran folk disgusted my
father with grand weddings, for Philip never could endure one.''

<p/>' Oh, Miss -RSB-\Iischief, there goes my hair again ! You know
Philip is exceedingly worried about Mr. Fielder. Lord Kilcoraa
has been writing to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) a situation.''

<p/>' That is an article they will be seeking all the rest of their
lives,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles. ' A man is done for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) begins to look
for a situation ! Yes ; those Fielders will be a drag on Philip
and Laura for ever ; for they don't quite like to cast them oi^
feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) does tliat he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) getting into the scrape,
by recommending him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>); and poor Laura thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) set the
example.''



 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIK OF REDCLYFFE 457

<p/>*I wish Eva was away from home,<div class="bookquote">'' said Amy, `for Aunt
Charlotte's accounts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) vex Laura so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eva</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ay ! trying to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) cake and have it, expecting to be Mr.
Fielder's wife, and reign as the earl's daughter all the same.
Poor thing ! the day they get the situation will be a sad one for
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does not know what poortith cauld will be like.''

<p/>' Poor Eva ! ' said Amy. ' I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) will shine and be all
the better for trouble. There is much that is so very nice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)/

<p/>' Ay, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has not spoilt it all by this time, -- as that creature
is doing with your hair ! You little monkey, what have you to
say to me 1 '

<p/>' Only to wish you good night. Come, baby, we must go to
Anne. Good night. Uncle Charles.''

<p/>Just as Amabel had borne off her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little girl, Mrs. Edmonstone
and Charlotte came in, after conducting Mrs. Henley to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>)
room. Charlotte made a face of wonder and dismay, and Mrs.
Edmonstone asked where Amy was.

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) carried the baby to the nursery just before you came. I
wish you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>). The little thing had pulled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
hair and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) look so pretty and like herself.''

<p/>' How well her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) spirits keep up ! She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) has been running up and
down stairs all day, helping about everything. Well ! we little
thought how things would turn out.''

<p/>' And that after all Amy would be the home-bird,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles.
' I don't feel as if it was wrong to rejoice in having her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) in this
sweet, shady brightness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) is now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div><p/>' Do you know wliether she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) means to go to church to-morrow ?
I don't like to ask.''

<p/>' Nor I.''

<p/>' I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) does,'' said Charlotte. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) told me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' I hojDe it will not be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ! Dear Amy.''

<p/>' She (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) would say it was wrong to have our heads fuller of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>)
than of our bride,'' said Charles.

<p/>' Poor Laura ! ' said Mrs. Edmonstone. ' I am glad it is all
right at last. Tliey have both gone through a great deal.''

<p/>' And not in A<div class="bookquote">``ain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>added Charles. ' Philip is '

<p/>' Oh, I say not a word against liim ! ' cried Mrs. Edmonstone.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) is most excellent ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will be very distinguished, -- he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) very liappy. Yes.''

<p/>' Li fact,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charles, ' he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is made to be one of the first in this
world, and to be first by being above it ; and the only reason we
are almost discontented is, that we compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) with one who
was too good for this world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Li</b></font>)</div><p/>' It is not only that.''

<p/>' Ah ! you did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at Piedclyffe, or you would do more
than simply forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) as a Christian.''

<p/>' I am very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>).''

<p/>' That is not quite enough,<div class="bookquote">'' said Cliarles, smiling, with a mis-
chievous air, though fully in earnest. ' Is it, Charlotte ? She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)-
must take him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) mamma's own heart.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Charlie</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-$58 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>*No, no, that is asking too much, Charlie/ said Mrs. Edmon-

<p/>stone. * Only one ever was ' then breaking off--' and I can

<p/>never think of Philip as I used to do.''

<p/>' I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) much better now/ said Charlotte.

<p/>' For my part/ said Charles, ' I never liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) -- nay, that's
too mild, I could not abide him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ; I rebelled against him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), heart,
soul, and taste. If it had not been for Guy, liis fashion of good-
ness would have made me into an extract of gall and wormwood,
at the very time you admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), and yet a great deal of it was
genuine. But it is only now that I have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>). Nay, I
look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>), I tliink him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) positively noble and grand, and when
I see proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) being entirely repentant, I perceive he (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) is a
thorough great man. If I had not seen one greater, I should
follow liis young man's example and take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for my hero model.*

<p/>' As if you wanted a liero model,'' whispered Charlotte, in a tone
between caressing and impertinence.

<p/>' I've had one ! ' returned Charles, also aside.

<p/>' Yes,'' said Mrs. Edmonstone, going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) own thoughts,
* unless there had been a great fund of regJ goodness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would
never have felt it so deeply. Indeed, even when I best liked Philip,
I never thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) capable of such repentance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) has shown.

<p/>' If mamma wants to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) very much,<div class="bookquote">'' said Charlotte, ' I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has only to look at our other company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>' Ay ! ' said Charles, ' we want no more explanation of the tone
of the <div class="bookquote">'' Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Edmonstone/Charles Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered the offer to invite
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister.''

<p/>' One comfort is, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can't stay long. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got a committee
meeting for the Ladies' Literary and Scientific Association, and
must go home for it tlie day after to-morrow,'' said Charlotte.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are very good, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) will give you a ticket,
Charlotte,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother, ' and another for Bustle.''

<p/>Mrs. Henley was, meanwhile, highly satisfied with the im-
pression she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) was making on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) aunt's family,
especially on Charles and Charlotte. The latter she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) patronized,
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) extreme tliough suppressed indignation, as a clever,
promising girl ; tlie former, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) discovered to be a very sviperior
young man, a most valuable assistant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) brother in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
business, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) self-complacency prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) from finding
out how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was playing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) off, whenever neither Pliilip nor
Laura were at hand to be hurt by it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) thought Laura a fine-looking person, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own family,
and fit to be an excellent lady of the house ; and in spite of the
want of fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother's choice had been
far better tlian if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had married that poor pale little Amabel,
■so silent and quiet that she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) never could make a figure anywhere,
and had notliing like the substantive character tliat her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) brother
must have in a wife.

<p/>Could Mrs. Henley have looked beliind tlie scenes she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) would
ihave marvelled.

<p/>*One kiss for mamma, and one for papn,'' was Amy's half-



<p/>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE 459

<p/>littered morning greeting, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) lifted from lier cot her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) little
one, with cheeks flushed by sleep Morning and evening Amy-
spoke those words, and was happy in the double kiss that Mary
had learnt to connect witli them ; happy too in holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up
to tlie picture, and saying ' papa,'' so that his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) child might never
recollect a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had not been a familiar and beloved idea.

<p/>A little play with the merry child, then came Anne to take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) away ; and with a suppressed sigh, Amabel dressed for the
first time without her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) weeds, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) had promised to leave
off* on Laura's wedding-day,

<p/>' No, I will not sigh ! ' then she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) thought, ' it does not put me
further from him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would be more glad than any one this
day, and so I must show some sign of gladness.''
_ So she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) put on such a dress as would be hers for life -- black
silk, and lace cap over her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) still plain hair, then with real pleasure
she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) put on Charles's bracelet, and the silver brooch, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
had last worn the evening when the echoes of Recoara had
.answered Guy's last chant. Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was visiting Laura,
cheering her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), soothing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) agitation, helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) to dress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
bridal array, much plainer than Amy's own had been, for it had
been the especial wish of both herself and Philip that their
wedding should be as quiet and unlike Guy's as possible. Then
Amabel was running down-stairs to see that all was right, think-
ing the breakfast- table looked dull and forlorn, and calling Char-
lotte to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) to make it appear a little more festal, with the
aid of some flowers. Charlotte wondered to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had
forgotten how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sliunned flowers last summer, for there she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
flitting from one old familiar plant to another in search of the
choicest, arranging little bouquets with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own peculiar grace
and taste, and putting them by each person's place, in readiness
to receive them.

<p/>It was as if no one else could smile that morning, except Mr.
Edmonstone, who was so pleased to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) looking cheerful, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) altered dress, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) repeatedly, and confidentially
told Mrs. Henley that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) little Amy was a regular darling, the
sweetest girl in the world, poor dear, except Laura.

<p/>Mrs. Henley, in the richest of all silks, looked magnificent and
superior ; Mrs. Edmonstone had tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) eyes, and attended
to every one softly and kindly, without a word ; Charlotte was
grave, helpful, and thoughtful ; Charles watching every one, and
intent on making things smooth ; Laura looked fixed in the
forced composure which she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had long ago learnt, and Philip, --
it was late before he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) appeared at all, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) came down,
there was nothing so plainly written on his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face as headache.

<p/>It was so severe that the most merciful thing was to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
to lie on the sofa in the dressing-room. Amabel said she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) would
fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) some camphor, and disappeared, while Laura sat still
w4th her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) forced composure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) father fidgeted, only restrained
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) presence from expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fears that Philip was too
unwell for the marriage to take place to-day, and Charles talked



<p/>480 THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE

<p/>cheerfully of the great improvement in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) general health, saying
this was but a chance thing, and that on the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) might be-
considered as quite restored.

<p/>Mrs. Henley listened and answered, but could not comprehend
the state of things. Breakfast was over, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Henley</b></font>) heard Amabel
speaking to Laura in the ante-room.

<p/>' It will go off soon. Here is a cup of hot coffee for you ta
take him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). I'll call you when it is time to go.''

<p/>Amabel and Charlotte were very busy looking after Laura's
packing up, and putting all that was wanted into the carriage,
in which the pair were to set off at once from church, without
returning to Hollywell.

<p/>At the last moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) went to warn Philip it was time to go,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) meant to walk to church alone, the best thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) head.

<p/>' It is better,'' said Laura, somewhat comforted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much better for your bathing it, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Philip/Morville/Philip Morville</b></font>)</div>said Philip,
rising ; then, turning to Amy, -- ' Do I wish you good-bye now 1 '

<p/>' No ; I shall see you at church, unless you don't like to have
my blackness there.''

<p/>' Would we not have our guardian angel, Laura 1 ' said Philip.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) would have been there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Edmonstone/Amy Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Amy. <div class="bookquote">``No one
would have been more glad, so thank you for letting me come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Laura/Edmonstone/Laura Edmonstone</b></font>)</div>said Laura, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``It is a
comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They left her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) stood a few minutes to enjoy the solitude,
and to look from the window at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) little girl, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had
sent out with Anne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) was just about to open the window to
call to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>), and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) look up with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) merry shouts
of ' Mamma ! ' when Philip came out at the garden-door, and was
crossing the lawn. Mary was very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), flattered by the
attention of the tallest person in the house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) stretched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms, and gave a cry of summons. Amabel watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
turn instantly, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) nurse, and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) in a close
embrace, whilst her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) little round arms met round his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
was unwilling to be restored to Anne, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) left she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) looked
up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) face, and unprompted, held up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) the primroses and
violets in her (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Those flowers were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) coat when Amabel saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) again at
church, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) knew that this spontaneous proof of affection from
Guy's little unconscious child was more precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Guy</b></font>) than
all the kindnesses she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>) could bestow.

<p/>Little space was there for musing, for it was liigh time to set
off* for church. Mary Ross met the party at the wicket of the
churchyard, took Charles on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) arm, and by look and sign
inquired for Amy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bright outwardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) answered, `and I think so inwardly.
Nothing does her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) so much good as to represent him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). Did you
wonder to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) ? '

<p/>■ <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ross/Ross</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would come. It is the
crowning point of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) forgiveness.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE 461

<p/>' Sucli forgiveness tliat slie has forgotten there is anything to
forgive,'' said Ciiarles.

<p/>PhiKp Morville and Laura Edmonstone stood before Mr. Ross.
It was not such a wedding as tlie last. Tliere was more personal
beauty, but no such air of freshness, youth, Kiid peace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ross</b></font>) was,
indeed, a very line-looking man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance more noble than
it had ever been, though pale and not only betraying the present
suffering of the throbbing, burning brow, but with the appear-
ance of a care-worn, harassed man, looking more as if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age was
hve-and-tliirty than eight-and-twenty. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>), in her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) plain
white muslin and quiet bonnet, was hardly bridal-looking in dress,
and so it was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>) face, still beautiful and brilliant in com-
plexion, but with the weight of care permanent on it, and all the
shades of feeling concealed by a fixed command of countenance,
unable, however, to hide the oppression of dejection and anxiety.

<p/>Yet to the eyes that only beheld the surface, there was nothing
but prosperity and happiness in a marriage between a pair who
had loved so long and devotedly, and after going through so
much for each other's sake, were united at length, with wealth,
lionour, and distinction before them. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) health was re-estab-
lished, and the last spring liad proved that his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) talents would
place him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in such a j^osition as had been the very object of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
highest hopes. Was not everything here for whicli the fondest
and most aspiring wishes could seek ? Yet for tlie very reason
that there was sadness at almost every heart, not one tear was
shed. Mrs. Edmonstone's thoughts were less engrossed with
the bride than with the young slender figure in black, standing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own drooping way, her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) head bent down, and the fingers
of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) right hand clasping tight her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) wedding-ring, through her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
white glove.

<p/>The service was over. Laura hung round her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) mother's neck
in an ardent embrace.

<p/>' Your pardon ! O, mamma, I see it all now ! '

<p/>Poor thing ! she (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had too much failed in a daughter's part to
go forth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) home with the clear, loving, hopeful heart her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
sister had carried from it ! Mrs. Edmonstone's kiss was a full
answer, however, a kiss unlike what it had been with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Edmonstone</b></font>)
efforts for many and many a month.

<p/>' Amy, pray that it may not be visited ! ' were the last words
breathed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) sister, as they were pressed in each other's
arms.

<p/>Philip scarcely spoke, only met their kindnesses with grateful
gestures and looks, and lirief replies, and the parting was hastened
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) might as soon as possible be at rest.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) only voluntary speech was as he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) bade farewell to Amabel, --

<p/>' My sister now ! '

<p/>' And his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) brother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) answered. ' Good-bye ! '

<p/>As soon as Amabel was alone in the carriage with Charles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Amabel</b></font>)
leant back, and gave way to a flood of tears.

<p/>* Amy, has it been too much ? '



<p/>462 THE HEIR OF KEDCLYFFE

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) said, rexjovering herself ; `but I am so glad ! It was-
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) chief desire. -RSB-S`o^v^ everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wished is fuLtilled.''

siderable care to you, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is safe on Laura's hands, and

and we settle into our home life.''

<p/>Amabel smiled.

<p/>' Amy, I do ^^dsh I was sure you are happy.''

<p/>' Yes, dear Charlie, indeed I am. You are all so very kind to me^,
and it is a blessing, indeed, that my own dear home can open to take-

<p/>' And it is happiness, not only thinking it ought to be 1 Don't

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Charlie, it is happiness. It must be when I

worry and perplex Philip, I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) was spared from it, and
had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) freshness and brightness his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) whole life. It beams out
on me more now, and it was such perfect happiness while I had

piness ; one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) husband's sweetest looks reflected on her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) face ;.
altogether, such a picture of youth, joy, and love, as had not been
displayed by the bride that morning. <div class="bookquote">``Amy, I don't believe

<p/>^ ' Nothing but my own fault. Nothing else can part me from

<p/>' Yes ; no one else had such a power of making happy,'' said
Charles, thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">``Amy, I really don't know whether even
you owe as much to your husband as I do. You were good for
something before, but when I look back on what I was when first
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) came, I know that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) leading, unconscious as it was, brought
out the stifled good in me. What a wretch I should have been ;;
what a misery to myself and to you all by this time ; and now,
I verily believe, that since he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) let in the sunlight from heaven on
me, I am better off than if I had as many legs as other people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>' Better ofl*r

has so little to plague them. Nobody else has such a <div class="bookquote">'' mamma,''

<p/>*I am sure you aio of wonderful use to every one,<div class="bookquote">'' said
Amabel ; ' neither Philip nor papa could get on without you to
do their writing for them. Besides, I want you to help me
wlien baby grows older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>' Is that the laudable result of that great book on education I
saw you reading the other day ? ' said Charles. ' Why don't you
borrow a few hints from Mrs, Henley 1 '

<p/>Amy's clear, playful laugh was just what it used to be.

<p/>' It is all settled, then, that you go on with us 1 Not that I
ever thought you were going to do anything so absurd as to set
up for yourself, you silly little woman : but it seems to be con-
sidered right to come to a formal settlement about such a grand
personage as my Lady Morville.''

<p/>' Yes ; it was better to come to an understanding,'' said Amabel.
*It was better that papa should make up Ids mind to see that I
can't turn into a young lady again. You see Charlotte will go
out with him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) and be the Miss Edmonstone for company, and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
is so proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) liveliness and -- how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is growing -- so
that will keep him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) from being vexed. So now you see I can go on
my own way, attend to baby, and take Laura's business about
the school, and keep out of the way of company, so that it is very
nice and comfortable. It is the very thing that Guy wished ! '

<p/>Amabel's life is here pretty well shown. That of Philip and
Laura may be guessed at. He (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) was a distinguished man, one of
the most honoured and respected in the country, admired for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) talents and excellence, and regarded universally as highly
prosperous and fortunate, the pride of all who had any connection
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>). Yet it was a harassed, anxious life, with little of repose
or relief ; and Laura spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) time between watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) and
tending liis health, and in the cares and representation befitting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) station, with little space for domestic pleasure and home
comfort, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) children more intimately through her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>)
sister's observation than through her (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) own.

<p/>Perfect and devoted as ever was their love, and they were
thought most admirable and happy people. There was some
wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) being a grave, melancholy man, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) had all
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) so richly to enjoy, contrary to every probability when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) began life. Still there was one who never could understand
why others should think him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) stern and severe, and why even
his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) own children should look up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) with love that partook of
distant awe and respect, one to v^hom he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) never was otherwise
than indulgent, nay, almost reverential, in the gentleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>)
kindness, and that was Mary Verena Morville.
