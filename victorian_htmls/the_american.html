<p/>CHAPTER I

<p/>On a brilliant day in May, in the year 1868, a gentleman was reclining
at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ease on the great circular divan which at that period occupied
the centre of the Salon Carré, in the Museum of the Louvre. This
commodious ottoman has since been removed, to the extreme regret of all
weak-kneed lovers of the fine arts, but the gentleman in question had
taken serene possession of its softest spot, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head thrown
back and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legs outstretched, was staring at Murillo's beautiful
moon-borne Madonna in profound enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) posture. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had removed
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat, and flung down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a little red guide-book and an
opera-glass. The day was warm; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was heated with walking, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
repeatedly passed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) forehead, with a somewhat
wearied gesture. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was evidently not a man to whom fatigue was
familiar; long, lean, and muscular, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) suggested the sort of vigor that
is commonly known as <div class="bookquote">``toughness.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exertions on this particular
day had been of an unwonted sort, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had performed great physical
feats which left him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) less jaded than his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tranquil stroll through the
Louvre. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had looked out all the pictures to which an asterisk was
affixed in those formidable pages of fine print in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Bädeker; his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
attention had been strained and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes dazzled, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had sat down
with an æsthetic headache. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had looked, moreover, not only at all the
pictures, but at all the copies that were going forward around them, in
the hands of those innumerable young women in irreproachable toilets who
devote themselves, in France, to the propagation of masterpieces, and if
the truth must be told, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had often admired the copy much more than the
original. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) physiognomy would have sufficiently indicated that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
a shrewd and capable fellow, and in truth he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had often sat up all night
over a bristling bundle of accounts, and heard the cock crow without a
yawn. But Raphael and Titian and Rubens were a new kind of arithmetic,
and they inspired our friend, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life, with a
vague self-mistrust.

<p/>An observer with anything of an eye for national types would have had
no difficulty in determining the local origin of this undeveloped
connoisseur, and indeed such an observer might have felt a certain
humorous relish of the almost ideal completeness with which he (<font color='blue'><b>connoisseur</b></font>) filled
out the national mould. The gentleman on the divan was a powerful
specimen of an American. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not only a fine American; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
in the first place, physically, a fine man. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appeared to possess that
kind of health and strength which, when found in perfection, are the
most impressive--the physical capital which the owner does nothing to
<div class="bookquote">``keep up.''  (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was a muscular Christian, it was quite without knowing
it. If it was necessary to walk to a remote spot, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) walked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had
never known himself to <div class="bookquote">``exercise.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had no theory with regard to
cold bathing or the use of Indian clubs; he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was neither an oarsman, a
rifleman, nor a fencer--he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had never had time for these amusements--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was quite unaware that the saddle is recommended for certain forms
of indigestion. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was by inclination a temperate man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had supped
the night before his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) visit to the Louvre at the Café Anglais--someone
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) it was an experience not to be omitted--and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had slept
none the less the sleep of the just. His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) usual attitude and carriage
were of a rather relaxed and lounging kind, but when under a special
inspiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) straightened himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) looked like a grenadier on
parade. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) never smoked. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had been assured--such things are said--that
cigars were excellent for the health, and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was quite capable of
believing it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) knew as little about tobacco as about homœopathy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had a very well-formed head, with a shapely, symmetrical balance of
the frontal and the occipital development, and a good deal of straight,
rather dry brown hair. His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) complexion was brown, and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) nose had a
bold well-marked arch. His (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) eye was of a clear, cold gray, and save for
a rather abundant moustache he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was clean-shaved. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had the flat jaw and
sinewy neck which are frequent in the American type; but the traces of
national origin are a matter of expression even more than of feature,
and it was in this respect that our friend's countenance was supremely
eloquent. The discriminating observer we have been supposing might,
however, perfectly have measured its expressiveness, and yet have been
at a loss to describe it. It had that typical vagueness which is not
vacuity, that blankness which is not simplicity, that look of being
committed to nothing in particular, of standing in an attitude of
general hospitality to the chances of life, of being very much at
one's own disposal so characteristic of many American faces. It was our
friend's eye that chiefly told his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) story; an eye in which innocence
and experience were singularly blended. It was full of contradictory
suggestions, and though it was by no means the glowing orb of a hero of
romance, you could find in it almost anything you looked for. Frigid
and yet friendly, frank yet cautious, shrewd yet credulous, positive
yet sceptical, confident yet shy, extremely intelligent and extremely
good-humored, there was something vaguely defiant in its concessions,
and something profoundly reassuring in its reserve. The cut of this
gentleman's moustache, with the two premature wrinkles in the cheek
above it, and the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) garments, in which an exposed
shirt-front and a cerulean cravat played perhaps an obtrusive part,
completed the conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) identity. We have approached him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),
perhaps, at a not especially favorable moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is by no means sitting
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) portrait. But listless as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lounges there, rather baffled
on the æsthetic question, and guilty of the damning fault -LRB-as we have
lately discovered it to be-RRB- of confounding the merit of the artist with
that of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) work -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) admires the squinting Madonna of the young
lady with the boyish coiffure, because he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) thinks the young lady herself
uncommonly taking-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is a sufficiently promising acquaintance.
Decision, salubrity, jocosity, prosperity, seem to hover within his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)
call; he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) is evidently a practical man, but the idea in his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) case, has
undefined and mysterious boundaries, which invite the imagination to
bestir itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) behalf.

<p/>As the little copyist proceeded with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) work, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sent every now and
then a responsive glance toward her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) admirer. The cultivation of the fine
arts appeared to necessitate, to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind, a great deal of by-play, a
great standing off with folded arms and head drooping from side to side,
stroking of a dimpled chin with a dimpled hand, sighing and frowning
and patting of the foot, fumbling in disordered tresses for wandering
hair-pins. These performances were accompanied by a restless glance,
which lingered longer than elsewhere upon the gentleman we have
described. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rose abruptly, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat, and approached the
young lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) placed himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) picture and looked at it for
some moments, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretended to be quite unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
inspection. Then, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with the single word which constituted
the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) French vocabulary, and holding up one finger in a
manner which appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to illuminate his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) meaning, <div class="bookquote">``_Combien?_''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
abruptly demanded.

<p/>The artist stared a moment, gave a little pout, shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulders,
put down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palette and brushes, and stood rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said our friend, in English. <div class="bookquote">``_Combien?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur wishes to buy it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the young lady in French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty, _splendide. Combien?_''  (<font color='red'><b>the American</b></font>)</div>repeated the American.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It pleases monsieur, my little picture? It's a very beautiful subject,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the young lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Madonna, yes; I am not a Catholic, but I want to buy it. _Combien?_
Write it here.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took a pencil from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the
fly-leaf of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guide-book. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and scratching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
chin with the pencil. <div class="bookquote">``Is it not for sale?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still
stood reflecting, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with an eye which, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
desire to treat this avidity of patronage as a very old story, betrayed
an almost touching incredulity, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was simply trying to look indifferent, and wondering how far she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might
go. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't made a mistake--_pas insulté_, no?''  (<font color='red'><b>interlocutor</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) interlocutor
continued. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you understand a little English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady's aptitude for playing a part at short notice was
remarkable. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conscious, perceptive eye and asked
him (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>interlocutor</b></font>) spoke no French. Then, <div class="bookquote">``_Donnez!_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said briefly, and took
the open guide-book. In the upper corner of the fly-leaf she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) traced a
number, in a minute and extremely neat hand. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handed back the
book and took up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palette again.

<p/>Our friend read the number: <div class="bookquote">``2,000 francs.''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said nothing for a time,
but stood looking at the picture, while the copyist began actively to
dabble with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) paint. <div class="bookquote">``For a copy, isn't that a good deal?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked at
last. <div class="bookquote">``_Pas beaucoup?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>_ The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady raised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palette, scanned him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) from head
to foot, and alighted with admirable sagacity upon exactly the right
answer. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a good deal. But my copy has remarkable qualities, it
is worth nothing less.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentleman in whom we are interested understood no French, but I
have said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was intelligent, and here is a good chance to prove it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apprehended, by a natural instinct, the meaning of the young woman's
phrase, and it gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so honest. Beauty,
talent, virtue; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) combined everything! <div class="bookquote">``But you must finish it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``_finish_, you know;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pointed to the unpainted hand of the
figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it shall be finished in perfection; in the perfection of
perfections!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried mademoiselle; and to confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
deposited a rosy blotch in the middle of the Madonna's cheek.

<p/>But the American frowned. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, too red, too red!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
complexion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Murillo</b></font>)</div>pointing to the Murillo, <div class="bookquote">``is--more delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Murillo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Delicate? Oh, it shall be delicate, monsieur; delicate as Sèvres
_biscuit_. I am going to tone that down; I know all the secrets of my
art. And where will you allow us to send it to you? Your address?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My address? Oh yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>And the gentleman drew a card from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-book
and wrote something upon it. Then hesitating a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If I
don't like it when it it's finished, you know, I shall not be obliged to
take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady seemed as good a guesser as himself. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am very sure
that monsieur is not capricious,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said with a roguish smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Capricious?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And at this monsieur began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I'm not
capricious. I am very faithful. I am very constant. _Comprenez?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur is constant; I understand perfectly. It's a rare virtue. To
recompense you, you shall have your picture on the first possible day;
next week--as soon as it is dry. I will take the card of monsieur.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took it and read his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name: <div class="bookquote">``Christopher Newman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tried to
repeat it aloud, and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bad accent. <div class="bookquote">``Your English names are
so droll!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Droll?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Newman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Newman, laughing too. <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever hear of
Christopher Columbus?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Bien sûr!_ He (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) invented America; a very great man. And is he (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>) your
patron?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My patron?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your patron-saint, in the calendar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, exactly; my parents named me for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christopher</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur is American?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>monsieur inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to carry my little picture away over there?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
explained her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) phrase with a gesture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I mean to buy a great many pictures--_beaucoup, beaucoup_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Christopher Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The honor is not less for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the young lady answered, <div class="bookquote">``for I am sure
monsieur has a great deal of taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must give me your card,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said; <div class="bookquote">``your card, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady looked severe for an instant, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``My father
will wait upon you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>But this time Mr. Newman's powers of divination were at fault. <div class="bookquote">``Your
card, your address,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply repeated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My address?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said mademoiselle. Then with a little shrug, <div class="bookquote">``Happily for
you, you are an American! It is the first time I ever gave my card to
a gentleman.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And, taking from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pocket a rather greasy portemonnaie,
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) extracted from it a small glazed visiting card, and presented the
latter to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) patron. It was neatly inscribed in pencil, with a great
many flourishes, <div class="bookquote">``Mlle. Noémie Nioche.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Newman</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Newman, unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
companion, read the name with perfect gravity; all French names to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
were equally droll.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And precisely, here is my father, who has come to escort me home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said
Mademoiselle Noémie. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speaks English. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will arrange with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned to welcome a little old gentleman who came shuffling up,
peering over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles at Newman.

<p/>M. Nioche wore a glossy wig, of an unnatural color which overhung his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
little meek, white, vacant face, and left it hardly more expressive
than the unfeatured block upon which these articles are displayed in
the barber's window. He (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was an exquisite image of shabby gentility. His (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>)
scant ill-made coat, desperately brushed, his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) darned gloves, his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) highly
polished boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) rusty, shapely hat, told the story of a person who
had <div class="bookquote">``had losses''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>and who clung to the spirit of nice habits even though
the letter had been hopelessly effaced. Among other things M. Nioche had
lost courage. Adversity had not only ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>), it had frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) was evidently going through his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>) remnant of life on tiptoe, for
fear of waking up the hostile fates. If this strange gentleman was
saying anything improper to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter, M. Nioche would entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
huskily, as a particular favor, to forbear; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would admit at the
same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very presumptuous to ask for particular favors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur has bought my picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie. <div class="bookquote">``When it's
finished you'll carry it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a cab.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a cab!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried M. Nioche; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stared, in a bewildered way, as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had seen the sun rising at midnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you the young lady's father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said you
speak English.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak English--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I will
bring it in a cab.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say something, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``Thank him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a little--not too
much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little, my daughter, a little?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche perplexed. <div class="bookquote">``How much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie. <div class="bookquote">``Don't make a fuss or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll
take back his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to fumble for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
snuff-box. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at Newman from head to foot; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
daughter and then at the picture. <div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't spoil it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
cried almost sublimely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must go home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie. <div class="bookquote">``This is a good day's work.
Take care how you carry it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) began to put up her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) utensils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I thank you?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``My English does not suffice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I spoke French as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, good-naturedly. <div class="bookquote">``Your
daughter is very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>and M. Nioche looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spectacles with tearful eyes
and nodded several times with a world of sadness. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has had an
education--_très-supérieure!_ Nothing was spared. Lessons in pastel at
ten francs the lesson, lessons in oil at twelve francs. I didn't look at
the francs then. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s an _artiste_, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I understand you to say that you have had reverses?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Reverses? Oh, sir, misfortunes--terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unsuccessful in business, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very unsuccessful, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, never fear, you'll get on your legs again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman cheerily.

<p/>The old man drooped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head on one side and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with an
expression of pain, as if this were an unfeeling jest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>demanded Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/>M. Nioche took a pinch of snuff. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) says I will make my fortune again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) will help you. And what else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) says thou art very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very possible. You believe it yourself, my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe it, my daughter? With this evidence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And the old man turned
afresh, with a staring, wondering homage, to the audacious daub on the
easel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not like to learn French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To learn French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To take lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To take lessons, my daughter? From thee?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``From me, my child? How should I give lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Pas de raisons!_ Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) immediately!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie, with
soft brevity.

<p/>M. Nioche stood aghast, but under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's eye he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) collected his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wits, and, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best to assume an agreeable smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) executed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
commands. <div class="bookquote">``Would it please you to receive instruction in our beautiful
language?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired, with an appealing quaver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To study French?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, staring.

<p/>M. Nioche pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) finger-tips together and slowly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``A little conversation!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Conversation--that's it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>murmured Mademoiselle Noémie, who had caught
the word. <div class="bookquote">``The conversation of the best society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our French conversation is famous, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>M. Nioche ventured to
continue. <div class="bookquote">``It's a great talent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But isn't it awfully difficult?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, very simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to a man of _esprit_, like monsieur, an admirer of beauty in
every form!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>and M. Nioche cast a significant glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter's
Madonna.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't fancy myself chattering French!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman with a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``And
yet, I suppose that the more a man knows the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur expresses that very happily. _Hélas, oui!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would help me a great deal, knocking about Paris, to know
the language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there are so many things monsieur must want to say: difficult
things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything I want to say is difficult. But you give lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor M. Nioche was embarrassed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smiled more appealingly. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a
regular professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) admitted. <div class="bookquote">``I can't nevertheless tell him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) that I'm
a professor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) it's a very exceptional chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>answered Mademoiselle Noémie;
<div class="bookquote">``an _homme du monde_--one gentleman conversing with another! Remember
what you are--what you have been!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A teacher of languages in neither case! Much more formerly and much
less to-day! And if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asks the price of the lessons?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) won't ask it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pleases, I may say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! That's bad style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asks, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Noémie had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bonnet and was tying the ribbons.
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) smoothed them out, with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) soft little chin thrust forward. <div class="bookquote">``Ten
francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my daughter! I shall never dare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't dare, then! He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) won't ask till the end of the lessons, and then I
will make out the bill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche turned to the confiding foreigner again, and stood rubbing
his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) hands, with an air of seeming to plead guilty which was not intenser
only because it was habitually so striking. It never occurred to Newman
to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for a guarantee of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) skill in imparting instruction; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
supposed of course M. Nioche knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own language, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appealing
forlornness was quite the perfection of what the American, for vague
reasons, had always associated with all elderly foreigners of the
lesson-giving class. Newman had never reflected upon philological
processes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chief impression with regard to ascertaining those
mysterious correlatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) familiar English vocables which were
current in this extraordinary city of Paris was, that it was simply a
matter of a good deal of unwonted and rather ridiculous muscular effort
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own part. <div class="bookquote">``How did you learn English?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked of the old man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I was young, before my miseries. Oh, I was wide awake, then.
My father was a great _commerçant_; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) placed me for a year in a
counting-house in England. Some of it stuck to me; but much I have
forgotten!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much French can I learn in a month?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>asked Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/>M. Nioche explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will speak like an angel!''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter.

<p/>But the native integrity which had been vainly exerted to secure M.
Nioche's commercial prosperity flickered up again. <div class="bookquote">``_Dame_, monsieur!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``All I can teach you!''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>And then, recovering himself at a
sign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``I will wait upon you at your hotel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I should like to learn French,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman went on, with democratic
confidingness. <div class="bookquote">``Hang me if I should ever have thought of it! I took for
granted it was impossible. But if you learned my language, why shouldn't
I learn yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) frank, friendly laugh drew the sting from the
jest. <div class="bookquote">``Only, if we are going to converse, you know, you must think of
something cheerful to converse about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, sir; I am overcome!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, throwing out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``But you have cheerfulness and happiness for two!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman more seriously. <div class="bookquote">``You must be bright and lively;
that's part of the bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche bowed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart. <div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir; you have
already made me lively.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and bring me my picture then; I will pay you for it, and we will
talk about that. That will be a cheerful subject!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Noémie had collected her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) accessories, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gave the
precious Madonna in charge to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, who retreated backwards out
of sight, holding it at arm's-length and reiterating his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) obeisance. The
young lady gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shawl about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) like a perfect Parisienne, and
it was with the smile of a Parisienne that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) patron.



<p/>CHAPTER II

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) wandered back to the divan and seated himself on the other side,
in view of the great canvas on which Paul Veronese had depicted
the marriage-feast of Cana. Wearied as he (<font color='blue'><b>Veronese</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>Veronese</b></font>) found the picture
entertaining; it had an illusion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Veronese</b></font>); it satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Veronese</b></font>) conception,
which was ambitious, of what a splendid banquet should be. In the
left-hand corner of the picture is a young woman with yellow tresses
confined in a golden head-dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is bending forward and listening,
with the smile of a charming woman at a dinner-party, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbor.
Newman detected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the crowd, admired her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
too had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) votive copyist--a young man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair standing on
end. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became conscious of the germ of the mania of the
<div class="bookquote">``collector;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken the first step; why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not go on? It
was only twenty minutes before that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bought the first picture
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was already thinking of art-patronage as a
fascinating pursuit. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflections quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good-humor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was on the point of approaching the young man with another <div class="bookquote">``_Combien?_''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Two or three facts in this relation are noticeable, although the logical
chain which connects them may seem imperfect. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew Mademoiselle
Nioche had asked too much; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no grudge for doing so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was determined to pay the young man exactly the proper sum. At this
moment, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention was attracted by a gentleman who had come
from another part of the room and whose manner was that of a stranger
to the gallery, although he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was equipped with neither guide-book nor
opera-glass. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) carried a white sun-umbrella, lined with blue silk, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) strolled in front of the Paul Veronese, vaguely looking at it, but
much too near to see anything but the grain of the canvas. Opposite to
Christopher Newman he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused and turned, and then our friend, who had
been observing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had a chance to verify a suspicion aroused by an
imperfect view of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face. The result of this larger scrutiny was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presently sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feet, strode across the room, and, with an
outstretched hand, arrested the gentleman with the blue-lined umbrella.
The latter stared, but put out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand at a venture. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was corpulent
and rosy, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) countenance, which was ornamented with a
beautiful flaxen beard, carefully divided in the middle and brushed
outward at the sides, was not remarkable for intensity of expression, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
looked like a person who would willingly shake hands with anyone. I know
not what Newman thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found a want of response in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) grasp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``don't say, now, you don't know
me--if I have _not_ got a white parasol!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) voice quickened the other's memory, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face expanded
to its fullest capacity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) also broke into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
Newman--I'll be blowed! Where in the world--I declare--who would have
thought? You know you have changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You haven't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the better, no doubt. When did you get here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Three days ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you let me know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no idea _you_ were here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been here these six years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be eight or nine since we met.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of that sort. We were very young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was in St. Louis, during the war. You were in the army.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, not I! But you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I was.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You came out all right?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came out with my legs and arms--and with satisfaction. All that seems
very far away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long have you been in Europe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seventeen days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``First time?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Made your everlasting fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Christopher Newman was silent a moment, and then with a tranquil smile
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And come to Paris to spend it, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see. So they carry those parasols here--the men-folk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course they do. They're great things. They understand comfort out
here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you buy them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere, everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Tristram, I'm glad to get hold of you. You can show me the ropes.
I suppose you know Paris inside out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tristram gave a mellow smile of self-gratulation. <div class="bookquote">``Well, I guess
there are not many men that can show me much. I'll take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity you were not here a few minutes ago. I have just bought a
picture. You might have put the thing through for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bought a picture?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram, looking vaguely round at the
walls. <div class="bookquote">``Why, do they sell them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean a copy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see. These,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram, nodding at the Titians and
Vandykes, <div class="bookquote">``these, I suppose, are originals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want a copy of a copy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram, mysteriously, <div class="bookquote">``you can never tell. They
imitate, you know, so deucedly well. It's like the jewellers, with their
false stones. Go into the Palais Royal, there; you see `Imitation' on
half the windows. The law obliges them to stick it on, you know; but you
can't tell the things apart. To tell the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tristram continued,
with a wry face, <div class="bookquote">``I don't do much in pictures. I leave that to my wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have got a wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I mention it? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a very nice woman; you must know her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s
up there in the Avenue d’Iéna.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are regularly fixed--house and children and all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a tip-top house and a couple of youngsters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Christopher Newman, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms a little, with a
sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I envy you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! you don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Tristram, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a little poke with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) parasol.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon; I do!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you won't, then, when--when--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't certainly mean when I have seen your establishment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you have seen Paris, my boy. You want to be your own master here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have been my own master all my life, and I'm tired of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, try Paris. How old are you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thirty-six.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_C’est le bel âge_, as they say here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does that mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that a man shouldn't send away his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has eaten his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All that? I have just made arrangements to take French lessons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you don't want any lessons. You'll pick it up. I never took any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you speak French as well as English?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram, roundly. <div class="bookquote">``It's a splendid language. You can
say all sorts of bright things in it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Christopher Newman, with an earnest desire for
information, <div class="bookquote">``that you must be bright to begin with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit; that's just the beauty of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The two friends, as they exchanged these remarks, had remained standing
where they met, and leaning against the rail which protected the
pictures. Mr. Tristram at last declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was overcome with
fatigue and should be happy to sit down. Newman recommended in the
highest terms the great divan on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been lounging, and they
prepared to seat themselves. <div class="bookquote">``This is a great place; isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman, with ardor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Great place, great place. Finest thing in the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>And then,
suddenly, Mr. Tristram hesitated and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose they
won't let you smoke here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stared. <div class="bookquote">``Smoke? I'm sure I don't know. You know the regulations
better than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? I never was here before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! in six years?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe my wife dragged me here once when we first came to Paris, but
I never found my way back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you say you know Paris so well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't call this Paris!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Tristram, with assurance. <div class="bookquote">``Come;
let's go over to the Palais Royal and have a smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't smoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A drink, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mr. Tristram led his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) companion away. They passed through the
glorious halls of the Louvre, down the staircases, along the cool, dim
galleries of sculpture, and out into the enormous court. Newman looked
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made no comments, and it was only when they
at last emerged into the open air that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``It seems
to me that in your place I should have come here once a week.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no you wouldn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``You think so, but you
wouldn't. You wouldn't have had time. You would always mean to go, but
you never would go. There's better fun than that, here in Paris. Italy's
the place to see pictures; wait till you get there. There you have to
go; you can't do anything else. It's an awful country; you can't get a
decent cigar. I don't know why I went in there, to-day; I was strolling
along, rather hard up for amusement. I sort of noticed the Louvre as I
passed, and I thought I would go in and see what was going on. But if I
hadn't found you there I should have felt rather sold. Hang it, I don't
care for pictures; I prefer the reality!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Tristram tossed off
this happy formula with an assurance which the numerous class of persons
suffering from an overdose of <div class="bookquote">``culture''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>might have envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).

<p/>The two gentlemen proceeded along the Rue de Rivoli and into the
Palais Royal, where they seated themselves at one of the little tables
stationed at the door of the café which projects into the great open
quadrangle. The place was filled with people, the fountains were
spouting, a band was playing, clusters of chairs were gathered beneath
all the lime-trees, and buxom, white-capped nurses, seated along the
benches, were offering to their infant charges the amplest facilities
for nutrition. There was an easy, homely gaiety in the whole scene, and
Christopher Newman felt that it was most characteristically Parisian.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Tristram, when they had tested the decoction
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had caused to be served to them, <div class="bookquote">``now just give an account of
yourself. What are your ideas, what are your plans, where have you
come from and where are you going? In the first place, where are you
staying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the Grand Hotel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Mr. Tristram puckered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) plump visage. <div class="bookquote">``That won't do! You must
change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Change?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>demanded Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's the finest hotel I ever was in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't want a `fine' hotel; you want something small and quiet
and elegant, where your bell is answered and you--your person is
recognized.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They keep running to see if I have rung before I have touched the
bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman <div class="bookquote">``and as for my person they are always bowing and
scraping to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are always tipping them. That's very bad style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Always? By no means. A man brought me something yesterday, and then
stood loafing in a beggarly manner. I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a chair and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't sit down. Was that bad style?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bolted, instantly. At any rate, the place amuses me. Hang your
elegance, if it bores me. I sat in the court of the Grand Hotel last
night until two o’clock in the morning, watching the coming and going,
and the people knocking about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're easily pleased. But you can do as you choose--a man in your
shoes. You have made a pile of money, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy the man who can say that? Enough for what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough to rest awhile, to forget the confounded thing, to look about
me, to see the world, to have a good time, to improve my mind, and,
if the fancy takes me, to marry a wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman spoke slowly, with
a certain dryness of accent and with frequent pauses. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
habitual mode of utterance, but it was especially marked in the words I
have just quoted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jupiter! There's a programme!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, all that
takes money, especially the wife; unless indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gives it, as mine
did. And what's the story? How have you done it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forehead, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms, and
stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) listened to the music, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at the
bustling crowd, at the plashing fountains, at the nurses and the babies.
<div class="bookquote">``I have worked!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered at last.

<p/>Tristram looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for some moments, and allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) placid eyes to
measure his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend's generous longitude and rest upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) comfortably
contemplative face. <div class="bookquote">``What have you worked at?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, at several things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you're a smart fellow, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman continued to look at the nurses and babies; they imparted to the
scene a kind of primordial, pastoral simplicity. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last,
<div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then, in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion's inquiries,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) related briefly his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) history since their last meeting. It was an
intensely Western story, and it dealt with enterprises which it will be
needless to introduce to the reader in detail. Newman had come out
of the war with a brevet of brigadier-general, an honor which in this
case--without invidious comparisons--had lighted upon shoulders amply
competent to bear it. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could manage a fight, when need was,
Newman heartily disliked the business; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) four years in the army
had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with an angry, bitter sense of the waste of precious
things--life and time and money and <div class="bookquote">``smartness''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and the early freshness
of purpose; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had addressed himself to the pursuits of peace
with passionate zest and energy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was of course as penniless when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
plucked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shoulder-straps as when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) put them on, and the only
capital at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) disposal was his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dogged resolution and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lively
perception of ends and means. Exertion and action were as natural to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as respiration; a more completely healthy mortal had never trod the
elastic soil of the West. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) experience, moreover, was as wide as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
capacity; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was fourteen years old, necessity had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) slim young shoulders and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) into the street, to earn that
night's supper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not earned it but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had earned the next night's,
and afterwards, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had had none, it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had gone
without it to use the money for something else, a keener pleasure or
a finer profit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brain in it, to many
things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been enterprising, in an eminent sense of the term; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had been adventurous and even reckless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had known bitter failure
as well as brilliant success; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was a born experimentalist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had always found something to enjoy in the pressure of necessity, even
when it was as irritating as the haircloth shirt of the mediæval monk.
At one time failure seemed inexorably his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) portion; ill-luck became
his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) bed-fellow, and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) touched he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) turned, not to gold, but
to ashes. His (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) most vivid conception of a supernatural element in the
world's affairs had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) once when this pertinacity of misfortune
was at its climax; there seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) something stronger in life than
his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) own will. But the mysterious something could only be the devil,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was accordingly seized with an intense personal enmity to this
impertinent force. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had known what it was to have utterly exhausted
his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) credit, to be unable to raise a dollar, and to find himself
at nightfall in a strange city, without a penny to mitigate its
strangeness. It was under these circumstances that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) entrance
into San Francisco, the scene, subsequently, of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) happiest strokes of
fortune. If he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did not, like Dr. Franklin in Philadelphia, march along
the street munching a penny-loaf, it was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) had not the
penny-loaf necessary to the performance. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) darkest days he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) had had
but one simple, practical impulse--the desire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) would have phrased
it, to see the thing through. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) did so at last, buffeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) way into
smooth waters, and made money largely. It must be admitted, rather
nakedly, that Christopher Newman's sole aim in life had been to
make money; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been placed in the world for was, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own
perception, simply to wrest a fortune, the bigger the better, from
defiant opportunity. This idea completely filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) horizon and
satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) imagination. Upon the uses of money, upon what one might
do with a life into which one had succeeded in injecting the golden
stream, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thirty-fifth year very scantily reflected. Life
had been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) an open game, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had played for high stakes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
won at last and carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) winnings; and now what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to do with
them? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was a man to whom, sooner or later, the question was sure to
present itself, and the answer to it belongs to our story. A vague sense
that more answers were possible than his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) philosophy had hitherto
dreamt of had already taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and it seemed softly and
agreeably to deepen as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lounged in this brilliant corner of Paris with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently went on, <div class="bookquote">``that here I don't feel at
all smart. My remarkable talents seem of no use. I feel as simple as a
little child, and a little child might take me by the hand and lead me
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll be your little child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram, jovially; <div class="bookquote">``I'll take you
by the hand. Trust yourself to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a good worker,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman continued, <div class="bookquote">``but I rather think I am a poor
loafer. I have come abroad to amuse myself, but I doubt whether I know
how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's easily learned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I may perhaps learn it, but I am afraid I shall never do it by
rote. I have the best will in the world about it, but my genius doesn't
lie in that direction. As a loafer I shall never be original, as I take
it that you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am original; like all those immoral
pictures in the Louvre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman continued, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to work at pleasure, any
more than I played at work. I want to take it easily. I feel deliciously
lazy, and I should like to spend six months as I am now, sitting under
a tree and listening to a band. There's only one thing; I want to hear
some good music.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Music and pictures! Lord, what refined tastes! You are what my wife
calls intellectual. I ain't, a bit. But we can find something better for
you to do than to sit under a tree. To begin with, you must come to the
club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What club?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Occidental. You will see all the Americans there; all the best of
them, at least. Of course you play poker?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, with energy, <div class="bookquote">``you are not going to lock me up
in a club and stick me down at a card-table! I haven't come all this way
for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce _have_ you come for! You were glad enough to play poker
in St. Louis, I recollect, when you cleaned me out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have come to see Europe, to get the best out of it I can. I want to
see all the great things, and do what the clever people do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The clever people? Much obliged. You set me down as a blockhead, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was sitting sidewise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) elbow on the back and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand. Without moving he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked a while at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
companion with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dry, guarded, half-inscrutable, and yet altogether
good-natured smile. <div class="bookquote">``Introduce me to your wife!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last.

<p/>Tristram bounced about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I won't. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doesn't
want any help to turn up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nose at me, nor do you, either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't turn up my nose at you, my dear fellow; nor at anyone, or
anything. I'm not proud, I assure you I'm not proud. That's why I am
willing to take example by the clever people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if I'm not the rose, as they say here, I have lived near it. I
can show you some clever people, too. Do you know General Packard? Do
you know C. P. Hatch? Do you know Miss Kitty Upjohn?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happy to make their acquaintance; I want to cultivate
society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Tristram seemed restless and suspicious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend askance, and
then, <div class="bookquote">``What are you up to, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going to write
a book?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Christopher Newman twisted one end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) moustache a while, in silence,
and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made answer. <div class="bookquote">``One day, a couple of months ago, something
very curious happened to me. I had come on to New York on some important
business; it was rather a long story--a question of getting ahead of
another party, in a certain particular way, in the stock-market. This
other party had once played me a very mean trick. I owed him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) a grudge, I
felt awfully savage at the time, and I vowed that, when I got a chance,
I would, figuratively speaking, put his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) nose out of joint. There was a
matter of some sixty thousand dollars at stake. If I put it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
way, it was a blow the fellow would feel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) really deserved no
quarter. I jumped into a hack and went about my business, and it was
in this hack--this immortal, historical hack--that the curious thing I
speak of occurred. It was a hack like any other, only a trifle dirtier,
with a greasy line along the top of the drab cushions, as if it had been
used for a great many Irish funerals. It is possible I took a nap; I
had been traveling all night, and though I was excited with my errand,
I felt the want of sleep. At all events I woke up suddenly, from a sleep
or from a kind of a reverie, with the most extraordinary feeling in the
world--a mortal disgust for the thing I was going to do. It came upon me
like _that!_''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fingers--<div class="bookquote">``as abruptly as an old wound
that begins to ache. I couldn't tell the meaning of it; I only felt that
I loathed the whole business and wanted to wash my hands of it. The idea
of losing that sixty thousand dollars, of letting it utterly slide and
scuttle and never hearing of it again, seemed the sweetest thing in the
world. And all this took place quite independently of my will, and I sat
watching it as if it were a play at the theatre. I could feel it going
on inside of me. You may depend upon it that there are things going on
inside of us that we understand mighty little about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jupiter! you make my flesh creep!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``And while you sat
in your hack, watching the play, as you call it, the other man marched
in and bagged your sixty thousand dollars?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not the least idea. I hope so, poor devil! but I never found
out. We pulled up in front of the place I was going to in Wall Street,
but I sat still in the carriage, and at last the driver scrambled down
off his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) seat to see whether his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) carriage had not turned into a hearse.
I couldn't have got out, any more than if I had been a corpse. What was
the matter with me? Momentary idiocy, you'll say. What I wanted to get
out of was Wall Street. I told the man to drive down to the Brooklyn
ferry and to cross over. When we were over, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to drive me out
into the country. As I had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) originally to drive for dear life
down town, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought me insane. Perhaps I was, but in that
case I am insane still. I spent the morning looking at the first green
leaves on Long Island. I was sick of business; I wanted to throw it all
up and break off short; I had money enough, or if I hadn't I ought to
have. I seemed to feel a new man inside my old skin, and I longed for
a new world. When you want a thing so very badly you had better treat
yourself to it. I didn't understand the matter, not in the least; but
I gave the old horse the bridle and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. As soon as I
could get out of the game I sailed for Europe. That is how I come to be
sitting here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to have bought up that hack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram; <div class="bookquote">``it isn't a
safe vehicle to have about. And you have really sold out, then; you have
retired from business?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made over my hand to a friend; when I feel disposed, I can take
up the cards again. I dare say that a twelvemonth hence the operation
will be reversed. The pendulum will swing back again. I shall be sitting
in a gondola or on a dromedary, and all of a sudden I shall want
to clear out. But for the present I am perfectly free. I have even
bargained that I am to receive no business letters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's a real _caprice de prince_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``I back out; a
poor devil like me can't help you to spend such very magnificent leisure
as that. You should get introduced to the crowned heads.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a moment, and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) easy smile, <div class="bookquote">``How does
one do it?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``It shows you are in earnest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am in earnest. Didn't I say I wanted the best? I know the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't the least idea. I want the biggest kind of entertainment a

about Venice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tristram, rising, <div class="bookquote">``I see I shall have to introduce you to
my wife!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER III

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) performed this ceremony on the following day, when, by appointment,
Christopher Newman went to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Mr. and Mrs. Tristram lived
behind one of those chalk-colored façades which decorate with their
pompous sameness the broad avenues manufactured by Baron Haussmann in
the neighborhood of the Arc de Triomphe. Their apartment was rich in the
modern conveniences, and Tristram lost no time in calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) visitor's
attention to their principal household treasures, the gas-lamps and the
furnace-holes. <div class="bookquote">``Whenever you feel homesick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must come up
here. We'll stick you down before a register, under a good big burner,
and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you will soon get over your homesickness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband stared; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife often had a tone which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found inscrutable
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not tell for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was in jest or in earnest.
The truth is that circumstances had done much to cultivate in Mrs.
Tristram a marked tendency to irony. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) taste on many points differed
from that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) made frequent concessions it
must be confessed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) concessions were not always graceful. They
were founded upon a vague project she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had of some day doing something
very positive, something a trifle passionate. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) meant to do she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
could by no means have told you; but meanwhile, nevertheless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was
buying a good conscience, by instalments.

<p/>It should be added, without delay, to anticipate misconception, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
little scheme of independence did not definitely involve the assistance
of another person, of the opposite sex; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was not saving up virtue to
cover the expenses of a flirtation. For this there were various reasons.
To begin with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had a very plain face and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was entirely without
illusions as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) appearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had taken its measure to a hair's
breadth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew the worst and the best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had accepted herself. It
had not been, indeed, without a struggle. As a young girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had spent
hours with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mirror, crying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes out; and later
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had from desperation and bravado adopted the habit of proclaiming
herself the most ill-favored of women, in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might--as in
common politeness was inevitable--be contradicted and reassured. It
was since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to live in Europe that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had begun to take the
matter philosophically. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) observation, acutely exercised here, had
suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that a woman's first duty is not to be beautiful, but
to be pleasing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) encountered so many women who pleased without
beauty that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mission. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had once heard an enthusiastic musician, out of patience with a gifted
bungler, declare that a fine voice is really an obstacle to singing
properly; and it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that it might perhaps be equally true
that a beautiful face is an obstacle to the acquisition of charming
manners. Mrs. Tristram, then, undertook to be exquisitely agreeable, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) brought to the task a really touching devotion. How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would
have succeeded I am unable to say; unfortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) broke off in the
middle. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own excuse was the want of encouragement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) immediate
circle. But I am inclined to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had not a real genius for
the matter, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would have pursued the charming art for itself. The
poor lady was very incomplete. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fell back upon the harmonies of the
toilet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thoroughly understood, and contented herself with
dressing in perfection. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived in Paris, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretended to
detest, because it was only in Paris that one could find things to
exactly suit one's complexion. Besides out of Paris it was always more
or less of a trouble to get ten-button gloves. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) railed at this
serviceable city and you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would prefer to reside, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
returned some very unexpected answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would say in Copenhagen, or
in Barcelona; having, while making the tour of Europe, spent a couple
of days at each of these places. On the whole, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poetic furbelows
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) misshapen, intelligent little face, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, when you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
a decidedly interesting woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was naturally shy, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
been born a beauty, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would -LRB-having no vanity-RRB- probably have remained
shy. Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was both diffident and importunate; extremely reserved
sometimes with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends, and strangely expansive with strangers. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
despised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband; despised him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) too much, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been perfectly
at liberty not to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been in love with a clever man
who had slighted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had married a fool in the hope that
this thankless wit, reflecting on it, would conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no
appreciation of merit, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had flattered himself in supposing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cared for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own. Restless, discontented, visionary, without
personal ambitions, but with a certain avidity of imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was,
as I have said before, eminently incomplete. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was full--both for
good and for ill--of beginnings that came to nothing; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
nevertheless, morally, a spark of the sacred fire.

<p/>Newman was fond, under all circumstances, of the society of women, and
now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) native element and deprived of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) habitual
interests, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned to it for compensation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took a great fancy to
Mrs. Tristram; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) frankly repaid it, and after their first meeting he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
passed a great many hours in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) drawing-room. After two or three talks
they were fast friends. Newman's manner with women was peculiar, and
it required some ingenuity on a lady's part to discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no gallantry, in the usual sense of the term;
no compliments, no graces, no speeches. Very fond of what is called
chaffing, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dealings with men, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) never found himself on a sofa
beside a member of the softer sex without feeling extremely serious.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not shy, and so far as awkwardness proceeds from a struggle with
shyness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not awkward; grave, attentive, submissive, often silent,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was simply swimming in a sort of rapture of respect. This emotion was
not at all theoretic, it was not even in a high degree sentimental; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had thought very little about the <div class="bookquote">``position''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of women, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
not familiar either sympathetically or otherwise, with the image of
a President in petticoats. His (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) attitude was simply the flower of
his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) general good-nature, and a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) instinctive and genuinely
democratic assumption of everyone's right to lead an easy life. If a
shaggy pauper had a right to bed and board and wages and a vote, women,
of course, who were weaker than paupers, and whose physical tissue was
in itself an appeal, should be maintained, sentimentally, at the public
expense. Newman was willing to be taxed for this purpose, largely, in
proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) means. Moreover, many of the common traditions with
regard to women were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fresh personal impressions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never
read a novel! He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been struck with their acuteness, their subtlety,
their tact, their felicity of judgment. They seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exquisitely
organized. If it is true that one must always have in one's work here
below a religion, or at least an ideal, of some sort, Newman found his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
metaphysical inspiration in a vague acceptance of final responsibility
to some illumined feminine brow.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spent a great deal of time in listening to advice from Mrs. Tristram;
advice, it must be added, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
have been incapable of asking for it, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no perception of
difficulties, and consequently no curiosity about remedies. The complex
Parisian world about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed a very simple affair; it was an immense,
amazing spectacle, but it neither inflamed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) imagination nor
irritated his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pockets, looked on
good-humoredly, desired to miss nothing important, observed a great many
things narrowly, and never reverted to himself. Mrs. Tristram's <div class="bookquote">``advice''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>was a part of the show, and a more entertaining element, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) abundant
gossip, than the others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) talking about himself; it seemed
a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) beautiful ingenuity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) never made an application
of anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, or remembered it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). For
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) appropriated him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was the most interesting thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
had had to think about in many a month. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wished to do something with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hardly knew what. There was so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was so rich
and robust, so easy, friendly, well-disposed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fancy
constantly on the alert. For the present, the only thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could do
was to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``horribly Western,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but in
this compliment the adverb was tinged with insincerity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to fifty people, and took extreme
satisfaction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) conquest. Newman accepted every proposal, shook
hands universally and promiscuously, and seemed equally unfamiliar
with trepidation or with elation. Tom Tristram complained of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wife's
avidity, and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could never have a clear five minutes with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had known how things were going to turn out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) never
would have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to the Avenue d’Iéna. The two men, formerly, had
not been intimate, but Newman remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) earlier impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
host, and did Mrs. Tristram, who had by no means taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
confidence, but whose secret he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently discovered, the justice to
admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband was a rather degenerate mortal. At twenty-five he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had been a good fellow, and in this respect he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was unchanged; but of a
man of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) age one expected something more. People said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was sociable,
but this was as much a matter of course as for a dipped sponge to
expand; and it was not a high order of sociability. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a great
gossip and tattler, and to produce a laugh would hardly have spared the
reputation of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) aged mother. Newman had a kindness for old memories,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found it impossible not to perceive that Tristram was nowadays
a very light weight. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) only aspirations were to hold out at poker, at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) club, to know the names of all the _cocottes_, to shake hands all
round, to ply his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rosy gullet with truffles and champagne, and to create
uncomfortable eddies and obstructions among the constituent atoms of the
American colony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was shamefully idle, spiritless, sensual, snobbish.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) irritated our friend by the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) allusions to their native
country, and Newman was at a loss to understand why the United States
were not good enough for Mr. Tristram. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had never been a very
conscious patriot, but it vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to see them treated as little better
than a vulgar smell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend's nostrils, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) finally broke out
and swore that they were the greatest country in the world, that they
could put all Europe into their breeches' pockets, and that an American
who spoke ill of them ought to be carried home in irons and compelled
to live in Boston. -LRB-This, for Newman was putting it very vindictively.-RRB-
Tristram was a comfortable man to snub, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) bore no malice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
continued to insist on Newman's finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) evening at the Occidental
Club.

<p/>Christopher Newman dined several times in the Avenue d’Iéna, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
host always proposed an early adjournment to this institution. Mrs.
Tristram protested, and declared that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband exhausted his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ingenuity in trying to displease her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I never try, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I know you loathe me quite
enough when I take my chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman hated to see a husband and wife on these terms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was sure
one or other of them must be very unhappy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew it was not Tristram.
Mrs. Tristram had a balcony before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) windows, upon which, during the
June evenings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was fond of sitting, and Newman used frankly to say
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) preferred the balcony to the club. It had a fringe of perfumed
plants in tubs, and enabled you to look up the broad street and see
the Arch of Triumph vaguely massing its heroic sculptures in the summer
starlight. Sometimes Newman kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) promise of following Mr. Tristram,
in half an hour, to the Occidental, and sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forgot it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
hostess asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a great many questions about himself, but on this
subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was an indifferent talker. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not what is called
subjective, though when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) interest was sincere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made
an almost heroic attempt to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) a great many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had done, and regaled her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) with anecdotes of Western life; she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was from
Philadelphia, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) eight years in Paris, talked of herself as a
languid Oriental. But some other person was always the hero of the tale,
by no means always to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) advantage; and Newman's own emotions were but
scantily chronicled. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had an especial wish to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
ever been in love--seriously, passionately--and, failing to gather
any satisfaction from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) allusions, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) at last directly inquired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
hesitated a while, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was
delighted to hear it, as it confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) private conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
a man of no feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked, very gravely. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think so? How do you recognize
a man of feeling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``whether you are very simple or
very deep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm very deep. That's a fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that if I were to tell you with a certain air that you have
no feeling, you would implicitly believe me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A certain air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Try it and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would believe me, but you would not care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have got it all wrong. I should care immensely, but I shouldn't
believe you. The fact is I have never had time to feel things. I have
had to _do_ them, to make myself felt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can imagine that you may have done that tremendously, sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there's no mistake about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When you are in a fury it can't be pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am never in a fury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry, then, or displeased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am never angry, and it is so long since I have been displeased that I
have quite forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that you are never angry. A man
ought to be angry sometimes, and you are neither good enough nor bad
enough always to keep your temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I lose it perhaps once in five years.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The time is coming round, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>hostess</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hostess. <div class="bookquote">``Before I have known

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to put me into one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be sorry. You take things too coolly. It exasperates me.
And then you are too happy. You have what must be the most agreeable
thing in the world, the consciousness of having bought your pleasure
beforehand and paid for it. You have not a day of reckoning staring you
in the face. Your reckonings are over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I suppose I am happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, meditatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been odiously successful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Successful in copper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``only so-so in railroads, and a
hopeless fizzle in oil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very disagreeable to know how Americans have made their money.
Now you have the world before you. You have only to enjoy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suppose I am very well off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Only I am tired of
having it thrown up at me. Besides, there are several drawbacks. I am
not intellectual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One doesn't expect it of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram answered. Then in a
moment, <div class="bookquote">``Besides, you are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I mean to have a good time, whether or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am
not cultivated, I am not even educated; I know nothing about history,
or art, or foreign tongues, or any other learned matters. But I am not
a fool, either, and I shall undertake to know something about Europe by

added in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``that I can't explain--a sort of a mighty hankering,
a desire to stretch out and haul in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that is very fine. You are the great
Western Barbarian, stepping forth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) innocence and might, gazing a
while at this poor effete Old World and then swooping down on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am not a barbarian, by a good deal. I am
very much the reverse. I have seen barbarians; I know what they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that you are a Comanche chief, or that you wear a blanket
and feathers. There are different shades.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a highly civilized man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I stick to that. If you
don't believe it, I should like to prove it to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram was silent a while. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to make you prove it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, at last. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to put you in a difficult place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That has a little conceited sound!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I have a very good opinion of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could put it to the test. Give me time and I will.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>And Mrs.
Tristram remained silent for some time afterwards, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was trying
to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pledge. It did not appear that evening that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) succeeded;
but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was rising to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) passed suddenly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was
very apt to do, from the tone of unsparing persiflage to that of almost
tremulous sympathy. <div class="bookquote">``Speaking seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe in you,
Mr. Newman. You flatter my patriotism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your patriotism?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Christopher demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even so. It would take too long to explain, and you probably would not
understand. Besides, you might take it--really, you might take it for a
declaration. But it has nothing to do with you personally; it's what you
represent. Fortunately you don't know all that, or your conceit would
increase insufferably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stood staring and wondering what under the sun he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``represented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive all my meddlesome chatter and forget my advice. It is
very silly in me to undertake to tell you what to do. When you are
embarrassed, do as you think best, and you will do very well. When you
are in a difficulty, judge for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall remember everything you have told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``There are
so many forms and ceremonies over here--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forms and ceremonies are what I mean, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but I want to observe them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Haven't I as good a
right as another? They don't scare me, and you needn't give me leave to
violate them. I won't take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not what I mean. I mean, observe them in your own way. Settle
nice questions for yourself. Cut the knot or untie it, as you choose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am sure I shall never fumble over it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>The next time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dined in the Avenue d’Iéna was a Sunday, a day on
which Mr. Tristram left the cards unshuffled, so that there was a trio
in the evening on the balcony. The talk was of many things, and at last
Mrs. Tristram suddenly observed to Christopher Newman that it was high
time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should take a wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has the audacity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram, who on Sunday
evenings was always rather acrimonious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose you have made up your mind not to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram
continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am sternly resolved on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram; <div class="bookquote">``fatally easy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I suppose you do not mean to wait till you are fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I am in a great hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One would never suppose it. Do you expect a lady to come and propose to
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am willing to propose. I think a great deal about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me some of your thoughts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, slowly, <div class="bookquote">``I want to marry very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Marry a woman of sixty, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram.

<p/>```Well' in what sense?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In every sense. I shall be hard to please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must remember that, as the French proverb says, the most beautiful
girl in the world can give but what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I will say frankly that I want
extremely to marry. It is time, to begin with: before I know it I shall
be forty. And then I'm lonely and helpless and dull. But if I marry now,
so long as I didn't do it in hot haste when I was twenty, I must do it
with my eyes open. I want to do the thing in handsome style. I do not
only want to make no mistakes, but I want to make a great hit. I want to
take my pick. My wife must be a magnificent woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Voilà ce qui s'appelle parler!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have thought an immense deal about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you think too much. The best thing is simply to fall in love.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I find the woman who pleases me, I shall love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enough. My wife
shall be very comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are superb! There's a chance for the magnificent women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not fair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``You draw a fellow out and put him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
off guard, and then you laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that I am very serious. To prove
it, I will make you a proposal. Should you like me, as they say here, to
marry you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To hunt up a wife for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is already found. I will bring you together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``we don't keep a matrimonial bureau. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will
think you want your commission.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Present me to a woman who comes up to my notions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I
will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a strange tone about it, and I don't quite understand you. I
didn't suppose you would be so coldblooded and calculating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was silent a while. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``I want a great
woman. I stick to that. That's one thing I _can_ treat myself to, and if
it is to be had I mean to have it. What else have I toiled and struggled
for, all these years? I have succeeded, and now what am I to do with
my success? To make it perfect, as I see it, there must be a beautiful
woman perched on the pile, like a statue on a monument. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be as
good as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is beautiful, and as clever as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is good. I can give my
wife a good deal, so I am not afraid to ask a good deal myself. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
shall have everything a woman can desire; I shall not even object to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being too good for me; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be cleverer and wiser than I can
understand, and I shall only be the better pleased. I want to possess,
in a word, the best article in the market.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you tell a fellow all this at the outset?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tristram
demanded. <div class="bookquote">``I have been trying so to make you fond of _me!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``I like to see a man
know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known mine for a long time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman went on. <div class="bookquote">``I made up my mind
tolerably early in life that a beautiful wife was the thing best worth
having, here below. It is the greatest victory over circumstances. When
I say beautiful, I mean beautiful in mind and in manners, as well as in
person. It is a thing every man has an equal right to; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may get it if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't have to be born with certain faculties, on purpose;
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs only to be a man. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs only to use his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, and such
wits as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has, and to try.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It strikes me that your marriage is to be rather a matter of vanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that if people notice my wife and

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``call any man modest!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But none of them will admire her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so much as I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have a taste for splendor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman hesitated a little; and then, <div class="bookquote">``I honestly believe I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I suppose you have already looked about you a good deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A good deal, according to opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have seen nothing that satisfied you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, half reluctantly, <div class="bookquote">``I am bound to say in honesty that
I have seen nothing that really satisfied me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You remind me of the heroes of the French romantic poets, Rolla and
Fortunio and all those other insatiable gentlemen for whom nothing in
this world was handsome enough. But I see you are in earnest, and I
should like to help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who the deuce is it, darling, that you are going to put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>heroes</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Tristram cried. <div class="bookquote">``We know a good many pretty girls, thank Heaven, but
magnificent women are not so common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any objections to a foreigner?''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) wife continued, addressing
Newman, who had tilted back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feet on a bar of the
balcony railing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pockets, was looking at the stars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No Irish need apply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram.

<p/>Newman meditated a while. <div class="bookquote">``As a foreigner, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``I have
no prejudices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, you have no suspicions!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
know what terrible customers these foreign women are; especially the
`magnificent' ones. How should you like a fair Circassian, with a dagger
in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) belt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman administered a vigorous slap to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``I would marry a
Japanese, if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleased me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) affirmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We had better confine ourselves to Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``The
only thing is, then, that the person be in herself to your taste?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is going to offer you an unappreciated governess!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Tristram
groaned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly. I won't deny that, other things being equal, I should prefer
one of my own countrywomen. We should speak the same language, and
that would be a comfort. But I am not afraid of a foreigner. Besides, I
rather like the idea of taking in Europe, too. It enlarges the field
of selection. When you choose from a greater number, you can bring your
choice to a finer point!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk like Sardanapalus!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You say all this to the right person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman's hostess. <div class="bookquote">``I happen
to number among my friends the loveliest woman in the world. Neither
more nor less. I don't say a very charming person or a very estimable
woman or a very great beauty; I say simply the loveliest woman in the

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``you have kept very quiet about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Were
you afraid of me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``but you have no perception of such

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) name is Claire? I give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does your friend wish to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not in the least. It is for you to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) change her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mind. It will
not be easy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has had one husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) a low opinion of
the species.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is a widow, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you already afraid? She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was married at eighteen, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) parents, in

to die a couple of years afterward, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is now twenty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``French by her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) father, English by her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is really more English

better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) belongs to the very top of the basket, as they say here.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) family, on each side, is of fabulous antiquity; her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mother is the
daughter of an English Catholic earl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) father is dead, and since her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)
widowhood she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mother and a married brother. There is
another brother, younger, who I believe is wild. They have an old hotel
in the Rue de l’Université, but their fortune is small, and they make a
common household, for economy's sake. When I was a girl I was put into a
convent here for my education, while my father made the tour of Europe.
It was a silly thing to do with me, but it had the advantage that it
made me acquainted with Claire de Bellegarde. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was younger than I
but we became fast friends. I took a tremendous fancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)
returned my passion as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) could. They kept such a tight rein on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) could do very little, and when I left the convent she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) had
to give me up. I was not of her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) _monde_; I am not now, either, but we
sometimes meet. They are terrible people--her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) _monde_; all mounted upon
stilts a mile high, and with pedigrees long in proportion. It is the
skim of the milk of the old _noblesse_. Do you know what a Legitimist
is, or an Ultramontane? Go into Madame de Cintré's drawing-room
some afternoon, at five o’clock, and you will see the best preserved
specimens. I say go, but no one is admitted who can't show his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) fifty
quarterings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And this is the lady you propose to me to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman. <div class="bookquote">``A lady
I can't even approach?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you said just now that you recognized no obstacles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at Mrs. Tristram a while, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) moustache. <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
a beauty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, then it's no use--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not a beauty, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is beautiful, two very different things. A
beauty has no faults in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, the face of a beautiful woman may have
faults that only deepen its charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember Madame de Cintré, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is as plain as a
pike-staff. A man wouldn't look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In saying that _he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ would not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) twice, my husband
sufficiently describes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram rejoined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good; is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clever?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is perfect! I won't say more than that. When you are praising
a person to another who is to know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), it is bad policy to go into
details. I won't exaggerate. I simply recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Among all women I
have known she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stands alone; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is of a different clay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to manage it. The only way will be to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to dinner.
I have never invited her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) before, and I don't know that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will come.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old feudal countess of a mother rules the family with an iron hand,
and allows her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to have no friends but of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own choosing, and to visit
only in a certain sacred circle. But I can at least ask her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Mrs. Tristram was interrupted; a servant stepped out upon
the balcony and announced that there were visitors in the drawing-room.
When Newman's hostess had gone in to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) friends, Tom Tristram
approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) guest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't put your foot into _this_, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, puffing the last
whiffs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cigar. <div class="bookquote">``There's nothing in it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked askance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), inquisitive. <div class="bookquote">``You tell another story, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say simply that Madame de Cintré is a great white doll of a woman,
who cultivates quiet haughtiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s haughty, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks at you as if you were so much thin air, and cares for you
about as much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very proud, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Proud? As proud as I'm humble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And not good-looking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Tristram shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shoulders: <div class="bookquote">``It's a kind of beauty you must be
_intellectual_ to understand. But I must go in and amuse the company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Some time elapsed before Newman followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friends into the
drawing-room. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at last made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appearance there he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remained but
a short time, and during this period sat perfectly silent, listening
to a lady to whom Mrs. Tristram had straightway introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and who
chattered, without a pause, with the full force of an extraordinarily
high-pitched voice. Newman gazed and attended. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came to bid
good-night to Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Dora Finch. How do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>)'s too noisy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) is thought so bright! Certainly, you are fastidious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tristram.

<p/>Newman stood a moment, hesitating. Then at last, <div class="bookquote">``Don't forget about
your friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Madame What's-her-name? the proud beauty. Ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) to dinner, and give me a good notice.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) departed.

<p/>Some days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came back; it was in the afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found Mrs.
Tristram in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) drawing-room; with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a visitor, a woman young and
pretty, dressed in white. The two ladies had risen and the visitor was
apparently taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leave. As Newman approached, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) received from
Mrs. Tristram a glance of the most vivid significance, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not
immediately able to interpret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a good friend of ours,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) companion,
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Christopher Newman. I have spoken of you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) has an
extreme desire to make your acquaintance. If you had consented to come
and dine, I should have offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) an opportunity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>The stranger turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) face toward Newman, with a smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not
embarrassed, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) unconscious _sang-froid_ was boundless; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
became aware that this was the proud and beautiful Madame de Cintré,
the loveliest woman in the world, the promised perfection, the proposed
ideal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made an instinctive movement to gather his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wits together.
Through the slight preoccupation that it produced he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a sense of a
long, fair face, and of two eyes that were both brilliant and mild.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been most happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately,
as I have been telling Mrs. Tristram, I go on Monday to the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had made a solemn bow. <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paris is getting too warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Cintré added, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friend's
hand again in farewell.

<p/>Mrs. Tristram seemed to have formed a sudden and somewhat venturesome
resolution, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smiled more intensely, as women do when they take
such resolution. <div class="bookquote">``I want Mr. Newman to know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
head on one side and looking at Madame de Cintré's bonnet ribbons.

<p/>Christopher Newman stood gravely silent, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) native penetration
admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Mrs. Tristram was determined to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend to
address him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a word of encouragement which should be more than one of the
common formulas of politeness; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was prompted by charity, it
was by the charity that begins at home. Madame de Cintré was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dearest
Claire, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) especial admiration but Madame de Cintré had found it
impossible to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and Madame de Cintré should for once be
forced gently to render tribute to Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would give me great pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, looking at Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the latter, <div class="bookquote">``for Madame de Cintré to say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tristram can speak
better for me than I can speak for myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again, with the same soft brightness.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you to be long in Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are keeping _me!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>and Madame de Cintré shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend's
hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A moment longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.

<p/>Madame de Cintré looked at Newman again; this time without her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) smile.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) eyes lingered a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Will you come and see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Mrs. Tristram kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). Newman expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thanks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
leave. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hostess went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to the door, and left Newman alone a
moment. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) returned, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``It was a fortunate
chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had come to decline my invitation. You triumphed
on the spot, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) ask you, at the end of three minutes, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was you who triumphed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You must not be too hard upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram stared. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did not strike me as so proud. I should say she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was shy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very discriminating. And what do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's handsome!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it was! Of course you will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not to-morrow; the next day. That will be Sunday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leaves Paris
on Monday. If you don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); it will at least be a beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) Madame de Cintré's address.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) walked across the Seine, late in the summer afternoon, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
way through those gray and silent streets of the Faubourg St. Germain
whose houses present to the outer world a face as impassive and as
suggestive of the concentration of privacy within as the blank walls
of Eastern seraglios. Newman thought it a queer way for rich people
to live; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ideal of grandeur was a splendid façade diffusing its
brilliancy outward too, irradiating hospitality. The house to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had been directed had a dark, dusty, painted portal, which swung open
in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ring. It admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) into a wide, gravelled court,
surrounded on three sides with closed windows, and with a doorway facing
the street, approached by three steps and surmounted by a tin canopy.
The place was all in the shade; it answered to Newman's conception of
a convent. The portress could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whether Madame de Cintré was
visible; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) would please to apply at the farther door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) crossed the
court; a gentleman was sitting, bareheaded, on the steps of the portico,
playing with a beautiful pointer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) rose as Newman approached, and, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand upon the bell, said with a smile, in English, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was afraid Newman would be kept waiting; the servants were scattered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
himself had been ringing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) didn't know what the deuce was in them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was a young man, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) English was excellent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smile very frank.
Newman pronounced the name of Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``that my sister is visible. Come in, and
if you will give me your card I will carry it to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had been accompanied on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) present errand by a slight sentiment,
I will not say of defiance--a readiness for aggression or defence, as
they might prove needful--but of reflection, good-humored suspicion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood on the portico, a card upon which,
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had written the words <div class="bookquote">``San Francisco,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presented it he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked warily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) interlocutor. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glance was
singularly reassuring; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked the young man's face; it strongly
resembled that of Madame de Cintré. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was evidently her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brother. The
young man, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, had made a rapid inspection of Newman's person.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had taken the card and was about to enter the house with it when
another figure appeared on the threshold--an older man, of a fine
presence, wearing evening dress. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked hard at Newman, and Newman
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the younger man repeated, as an
introduction of the visitor. The other took the card from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand,
read it in a rapid glance, looked again at Newman from head to foot,
hesitated a moment, and then said, gravely but urbanely, <div class="bookquote">``Madame de
Cintré is not at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The younger man made a gesture, and then, turning to Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I am very
sorry, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>Newman gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a friendly nod, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) no malice, and
retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) steps. At the porter's lodge he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped; the two men were
still standing on the portico.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is the gentleman with the dog?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked of the old woman who
reappeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had begun to learn French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Monsieur le Comte.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the other?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is Monsieur le Marquis.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A marquis?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Christopher in English, which the old woman
fortunately did not understand. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquis</b></font>)'s not the butler!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV

<p/>Early one morning, before Christopher Newman was dressed, a little old
man was ushered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) apartment, followed by a youth in a blouse,
bearing a picture in a brilliant frame. Newman, among the distractions
of Paris, had forgotten M. Nioche and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) accomplished daughter; but
this was an effective reminder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you had given me up, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, after many
apologies and salutations. <div class="bookquote">``We have made you wait so many days. You
accused us, perhaps, of inconstancy, of bad faith. But behold me at
last! And behold also the pretty Madonna. Place it on a chair, my
friend, in a good light, so that monsieur may admire it.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>And M. Nioche,
addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to dispose the work of art.

<p/>It had been endued with a layer of varnish an inch thick and its frame,
of an elaborate pattern, was at least a foot wide. It glittered and
twinkled in the morning light, and looked, to Newman's eyes, wonderfully
splendid and precious. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a very happy purchase, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
felt rich in the possession of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood looking at it complacently,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) proceeded with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) toilet, and M. Nioche, who had dismissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
own attendant, hovered near, smiling and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has wonderful _finesse_,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) murmured, caressingly. <div class="bookquote">``And here
and there are marvelous touches, you probably perceive them, sir. It
attracted great attention on the Boulevard, as we came along. And then a
gradation of tones! That's what it is to know how to paint. I don't
say it because I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) father, sir; but as one man of taste addressing
another I cannot help observing that you have there an exquisite work.
It is hard to produce such things and to have to part with them. If our
means only allowed us the luxury of keeping it! I really may say, sir--''
 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>and M. Nioche gave a little feebly insinuating laugh--<div class="bookquote">``I really may
say that I envy you! You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``we have taken the
liberty of offering you a frame. It increases by a trifle the value of
the work, and it will save you the annoyance--so great for a person of
your delicacy--of going about to bargain at the shops.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The language spoken by M. Nioche was a singular compound, which I shrink
from the attempt to reproduce in its integrity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had apparently once
possessed a certain knowledge of English, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) accent was oddly
tinged with the cockneyism of the British metropolis. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) learning
had grown rusty with disuse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) vocabulary was defective and
capricious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had repaired it with large patches of French, with words
anglicized by a process of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own, and with native idioms literally
translated. The result, in the form in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in all humility
presented it, would be scarcely comprehensible to the reader, so that I
have ventured to trim and sift it. Newman only half understood it, but
it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and the old man's decent forlornness appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
democratic instincts. The assumption of a fatality in misery always
irritated his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strong good nature--it was almost the only thing that did
so; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt the impulse to wipe it out, as it were, with the sponge
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own prosperity. The papa of Mademoiselle Noémie, however, had
apparently on this occasion been vigorously indoctrinated, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) showed
a certain tremulous eagerness to cultivate unexpected opportunities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much do I owe you, then, with the frame?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will make in all three thousand francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, smiling
agreeably, but folding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in instinctive suppliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you give me a receipt?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought one,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``I took the liberty of drawing it
up, in case monsieur should happen to desire to discharge his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) debt.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew a paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket-book and presented it to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patron.
The document was written in a minute, fantastic hand, and couched in the
choicest language.

<p/>Newman laid down the money, and M. Nioche dropped the napoleons one by
one, solemnly and lovingly, into an old leathern purse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is your young lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made a great impression
on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An impression? Monsieur is very good. Monsieur admires her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appearance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very pretty, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very pretty!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is the harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes upon a spot on the carpet and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head.
Then looking up at Newman with a gaze that seemed to brighten and
expand, <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur knows what Paris is. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is dangerous to beauty, when
beauty hasn't the sou.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but that is not the case with your daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is rich, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; we are rich for six months. But if my daughter were a plain
girl I should sleep better all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are afraid of the young men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The young and the old!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) ought to get a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, monsieur, one doesn't get a husband for nothing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband must
take her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is; I can't give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a sou. But the young men don't see
with that eye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) talent is in itself a dowry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, sir, it needs first to be converted into specie!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>and M. Nioche
slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) purse tenderly before he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stowed it away. <div class="bookquote">``The operation
doesn't take place every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, your young men are very shabby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that's all I can
say. They ought to pay for your daughter, and not ask money themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those are very noble ideas, monsieur; but what will you have? They are
not the ideas of this country. We want to know what we are about when we
marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How big a portion does your daughter want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche stared, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wondered what was coming next; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
promptly recovered himself, at a venture, and replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew a
very nice young man, employed by an insurance company, who would content
himself with fifteen thousand francs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let your daughter paint half a dozen pictures for me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall
have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dowry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half a dozen pictures--her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dowry! Monsieur is not speaking
inconsiderately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will make me six or eight copies in the Louvre as pretty as that
Madonna, I will pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) the same price,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Poor M. Nioche was speechless a moment, with amazement and gratitude,
and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seized Newman's hand, pressed it between his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own ten
fingers, and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with watery eyes. <div class="bookquote">``As pretty as that? They
shall be a thousand times prettier--they shall be magnificent, sublime.
Ah, if I only knew how to paint, myself, sir, so that I might lend a
hand! What can I do to thank you? _Voyons!_''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forehead
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tried to think of something.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you have thanked me enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here it is, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``To express my gratitude, I will
charge you nothing for the lessons in French conversation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The lessons? I had quite forgotten them. Listening to your English,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>added Newman, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``is almost a lesson in French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I don't profess to teach English, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``But
for my own admirable tongue I am still at your service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you are here, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``we will begin. This is a very
good hour. I am going to have my coffee; come every morning at half-past
nine and have yours with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur offers me my coffee, also?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``Truly, my _beaux
jours_ are coming back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``let us begin. The coffee is almighty hot. How do
you say that in French?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Every day, then, for the following three weeks, the minutely respectable
figure of M. Nioche made its appearance, with a series of little
inquiring and apologetic obeisances, among the aromatic fumes of
Newman's morning beverage. I don't know how much French our friend
learned, but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) himself said, if the attempt did him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) no good, it
could at any rate do him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) no harm. And it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); it gratified that
irregularly sociable side of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nature which had always expressed
itself in a relish for ungrammatical conversation, and which often, even
in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) busy and preoccupied days, had made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sit on rail fences
in young Western towns, in the twilight, in gossip hardly less than
fraternal with humorous loafers and obscure fortune-seekers. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had
notions, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went, about talking with the natives; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been
assured, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) judgment approved the advice, that in traveling abroad
it was an excellent thing to look into the life of the country. M.
Nioche was very much of a native and, though his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life might not be
particularly worth looking into, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was a palpable and smoothly-rounded
unit in that picturesque Parisian civilization which offered our hero so
much easy entertainment and propounded so many curious problems to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
inquiring and practical mind. Newman was fond of statistics; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked
to know how things were done; it gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to learn what taxes were
paid, what profits were gathered, what commercial habits prevailed, how
the battle of life was fought. M. Nioche, as a reduced capitalist, was
familiar with these considerations, and he (<font color='blue'><b>capitalist</b></font>) formulated his (<font color='blue'><b>capitalist</b></font>) information,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>capitalist</b></font>) was proud to be able to impart, in the neatest possible
terms and with a pinch of snuff between finger and thumb. As a
Frenchman--quite apart from Newman's napoleons--M. Nioche loved
conversation, and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) decay his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) urbanity had not grown rusty. As
a Frenchman, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could give a clear account of things, and--still as
a Frenchman--when his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) knowledge was at fault he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) could supply its lapses
with the most convenient and ingenious hypotheses. The little shrunken
financier was intensely delighted to have questions asked him (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>)
scraped together information, by frugal processes, and took notes, in
his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) little greasy pocket-book, of incidents which might interest his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>)
munificent friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) read old almanacs at the book-stalls on the quays,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) began to frequent another _café_, where more newspapers were
taken and his (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) postprandial _demitasse_ cost him (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) a penny extra, and where
he (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) used to con the tattered sheets for curious anecdotes, freaks of
nature, and strange coincidences. He (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) would relate with solemnity the
next morning that a child of five years of age had lately died at
Bordeaux, whose brain had been found to weigh sixty ounces--the brain of
a Napoleon or a Washington! or that Madame P--, _charcutière_ in the Rue
de Clichy, had found in the wadding of an old petticoat the sum of
three hundred and sixty francs, which she (<font color='blue'><b>financier</b></font>) had lost five years before.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Napoleon</b></font>) words with great distinctness and sonority, and Newman
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way of dealing with the French tongue was very
superior to the bewildering chatter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard in other mouths.
Upon this M. Nioche's accent became more finely trenchant than ever, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
offered to read extracts from Lamartine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) protested that, although
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did endeavor according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feeble lights to cultivate refinement
of diction, monsieur, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wanted the real thing, should go to the
Théâtre Français.

<p/>Newman took an interest in French thriftiness and conceived a lively
admiration for Parisian economies. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own economic genius was so
entirely for operations on a larger scale, and, to move at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ease, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
needed so imperatively the sense of great risks and great prizes, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found an ungrudging entertainment in the spectacle of fortunes made
by the aggregation of copper coins, and in the minute subdivision of
labor and profit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) questioned M. Nioche about his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own manner of life,
and felt a friendly mixture of compassion and respect over the recital
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) delicate frugalities. The worthy man told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) how, at one period,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter had supported existence comfortably upon the sum of
fifteen sous _per diem_; recently, having succeeded in hauling ashore
the last floating fragments of the wreck of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) budget had
been a trifle more ample. But they still had to count their sous very
narrowly, and M. Nioche intimated with a sigh that Mademoiselle Noémie
did not bring to this task that zealous cooperation which might have
been desired.

<p/>``But what will you have?''' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) asked, philosophically. <div class="bookquote">``One is young, one
is pretty, one needs new dresses and fresh gloves; one can't wear shabby
gowns among the splendors of the Louvre.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your daughter earns enough to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman.

<p/>M. Nioche looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with weak, uncertain eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have liked
to be able to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter's talents were appreciated, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) crooked little daubs commanded a market; but it seemed a scandal
to abuse the credulity of this free-handed stranger, who, without a
suspicion or a question, had admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to equal social rights. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
compromised, and declared that while it was obvious that Mademoiselle
Noémie's reproductions of the old masters had only to be seen to be
coveted, the prices which, in consideration of their altogether peculiar
degree of finish, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) felt obliged to ask for them had kept purchasers
at a respectful distance. <div class="bookquote">``Poor little one!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, with a
sigh; <div class="bookquote">``it is almost a pity that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) work is so perfect! It would be in
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) interest to paint less well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if Mademoiselle Noémie has this devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) art,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman once
observed, <div class="bookquote">``why should you have those fears for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that you spoke of the
other day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche meditated: there was an inconsistency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) position; it made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chronically uncomfortable. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no desire to destroy the
goose with the golden eggs--Newman's benevolent confidence--he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt a
tremulous impulse to speak out all his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) trouble. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is an artist,
my dear sir, most assuredly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) declared. <div class="bookquote">``But, to tell you the truth,
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is also a _franche coquette_. I am sorry to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added in a
moment, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head with a world of harmless bitterness, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
comes honestly by it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother was one before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were not happy with your wife?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/>M. Nioche gave half a dozen little backward jerks of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
my purgatory, monsieur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) deceived you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Under my nose, year after year. I was too stupid, and the temptation
was too great. But I found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) out at last. I have only been once in my
life a man to be afraid of; I know it very well; it was in that hour!
Nevertheless I don't like to think of it. I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)--I can't tell you
how much. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a bad woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is not living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) influence on your daughter, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman encouragingly, <div class="bookquote">``is
not to be feared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) cared no more for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter than for the sole of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shoe! But
Noémie has no need of influence. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is sufficient to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is
stronger than I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't obey you, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) can't obey, monsieur, since I don't command. What would be the use?
It would only irritate her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and drive her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to some _coup de tête_. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
is very clever, like her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would waste no time about it. As
a child--when I was happy, or supposed I was--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) studied drawing and
painting with first-class professors, and they assured me she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had a
talent. I was delighted to believe it, and when I went into society I
used to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pictures with me in a portfolio and hand them round
to the company. I remember, once, a lady thought I was offering them for
sale, and I took it very ill. We don't know what we may come to! Then
came my dark days, and my explosion with Madame Nioche. Noémie had no
more twenty-franc lessons; but in the course of time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grew
older, and it became highly expedient that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should do something that
would help to keep us alive, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bethought herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) palette and
brushes. Some of our friends in the _quartier_ pronounced the idea
fantastic: they recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to try bonnet making, to get a situation
in a shop, or--if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was more ambitious--to advertise for a place of
_dame de compagnie_. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did advertise, and an old lady wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
a letter and bade her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The old lady liked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and
offered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) living and six hundred francs a year; but Noémie
discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) armchair and had only two
visitors, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) confessor and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nephew: the confessor very strict, and
the nephew a man of fifty, with a broken nose and a government clerkship
of two thousand francs. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) old lady over, bought a paint-box,
a canvas, and a new dress, and went and set up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) easel in the Louvre.
There in one place and another, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has passed the last two years; I
can't say it has made us millionaires. But Noémie tells me that Rome was
not built in a day, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is making great progress, that I must leave
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own devices. The fact is, without prejudice to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) genius,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has no idea of burying herself alive. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) likes to see the
world, and to be seen. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says, herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) can't work in
the dark. With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appearance it is very natural. Only, I can't help
worrying and trembling and wondering what may happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there all
alone, day after day, amid all that coming and going of strangers. I
can't be always at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) side. I go with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the morning, and I come to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't have me near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in the interval; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) says
I make her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nervous. As if it didn't make me nervous to wander about
all day without her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! Ah, if anything were to happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried
M. Nioche, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) two fists and jerking back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head again,
portentously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I guess nothing will happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I should shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, solemnly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we'll marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``since that's how you manage it; and
I will go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tomorrow at the Louvre and pick out the pictures
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is to copy for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche had brought Newman a message from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter, in acceptance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) magnificent commission, the young lady declaring herself his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) most
devoted servant, promising her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) most zealous endeavor, and regretting
that the proprieties forbade her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coming to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in person. The
morning after the conversation just narrated, Newman reverted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
intention of meeting Mademoiselle Noémie at the Louvre. M. Nioche
appeared preoccupied, and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) budget of anecdotes unopened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
took a great deal of snuff, and sent certain oblique, appealing glances
toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stalwart pupil. At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood a moment, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had polished his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) calico
pocket-handkerchief, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) small, pale eyes fixed strangely upon
Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>our hero demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse the solicitude of a father's heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``You
inspire me with boundless confidence, but I can't help giving you a
warning. After all, you are a man, you are young and at liberty. Let me
beseech you, then, to respect the innocence of Mademoiselle Nioche!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had wondered what was coming, and at this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) broke into a laugh.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was on the point of declaring that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own innocence struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as
the more exposed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) contented himself with promising to treat the
young girl with nothing less than veneration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waiting for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), seated upon the great divan in the Salon Carré. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not in
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) working-day costume, but wore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bonnet and gloves and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
parasol, in honor of the occasion. These articles had been selected with
unerring taste, and a fresher, prettier image of youthful alertness
and blooming discretion was not to be conceived. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made Newman a most
respectful curtsey and expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gratitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liberality in a
wonderfully graceful little speech. It annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to have a charming
young girl stand there thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feel uncomfortable
to think that this perfect young lady, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) excellent manners and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) finished intonation, was literally in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), in
such French as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could muster, that the thing was not worth mentioning,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) services a great favor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you please, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie, <div class="bookquote">``we will pass the
review.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked slowly round the room, then passed into the others and
strolled about for half an hour. Mademoiselle Noémie evidently relished
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) situation, and had no desire to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) public interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
striking-looking patron to a close. Newman perceived that prosperity
agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The little thin-lipped, peremptory air with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father on the occasion of their former meeting had
given place to the most lingering and caressing tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of pictures do you desire?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Sacred, or profane?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a few of each,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But I want something bright and gay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something gay? There is nothing very gay in this solemn old Louvre. But
we will see what we can find. You speak French to-day like a charm. My
father has done wonders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am a bad subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am too old to learn a
language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too old? _Quelle folie!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>cried Mademoiselle Noémie, with a clear,
shrill laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You are a very young man. And how do you like my father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a very nice old gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) never laughs at my blunders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is very _comme il faut_, my papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie, <div class="bookquote">``and as
honest as the day. Oh, an exceptional probity! You could trust him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) with
millions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you always obey him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Obey him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you do what he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) bids you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl stopped and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a spot of color in
either cheek, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expressive French eye, which projected too much
for perfect beauty, there was a slight gleam of audacity. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you
ask me that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) demanded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think me a bad girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave a strange smile.

<p/>Newman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pretty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
not in the least dazzled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remembered poor M. Nioche's solicitude for
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``innocence,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) laughed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes met hers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face was the
oddest mixture of youth and maturity, and beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) candid brow
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) searching little smile seemed to contain a world of ambiguous
intentions. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was pretty enough, certainly to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father nervous;
but, as regards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) innocence, Newman felt ready on the spot to affirm
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never parted with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had simply never had any; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had
been looking at the world since she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ten years old, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have
been a wise man who could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any secrets. In her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long mornings at
the Louvre she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not only studied Madonnas and St. Johns; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had kept
an eye upon all the variously embodied human nature around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
had formed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conclusions. In a certain sense, it seemed to Newman, M.
Nioche might be at rest; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter might do something very audacious,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would never do anything foolish. Newman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) long-drawn,
leisurely smile, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) even, unhurried utterance, was always,
mentally, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked himself, now, what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in that way for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had an idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
to confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did think her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a bad girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``it would be very bad manners in me to judge
you that way. I don't know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my father has complained to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says you are a coquette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shouldn't go about saying such things to gentlemen! But you don't
believe it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again, gave a shrug and a smile, and then pointed to a
small Italian picture, a Marriage of St. Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``How should you like
that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't please me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``The young lady in the yellow dress
is not pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are a great connoisseur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>murmured Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In pictures? Oh, no; I know very little about them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In pretty women, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that I am hardly better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say to that, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl asked, indicating a
superb Italian portrait of a lady. <div class="bookquote">``I will do it for you on a smaller
scale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On a smaller scale? Why not as large as the original?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Noémie glanced at the glowing splendor of the Venetian
masterpiece and gave a little toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like that
woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks stupid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Decidedly, I must have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as large as
life. And just as stupid as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mocking smile,
<div class="bookquote">``It certainly ought to be easy for me to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look stupid!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, puzzled.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave another little shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Seriously, then, you want that
portrait--the golden hair, the purple satin, the pearl necklace, the two
magnificent arms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything--just as it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would nothing else do, instead?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I want some other things, but I want that too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Noémie turned away a moment, walked to the other side of
the hall, and stood there, looking vaguely about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). At last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came
back. <div class="bookquote">``It must be charming to be able to order pictures at such a rate.
Venetian portraits, as large as life! You go at it _en prince_. And you
are going to travel about Europe that way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I intend to travel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ordering, buying, spending money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall spend some money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very happy to have it. And you are perfectly free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, free?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nothing to bother you--no family, no wife, no _fiancée?_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am tolerably free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Je le veux bien!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, proving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had learned more
French than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) admitted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long shall you stay in Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a few days more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you go away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is getting hot, and I must go to Switzerland.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Switzerland? That's a fine country. I would give my new parasol
to see it! Lakes and mountains, romantic valleys and icy peaks! Oh,
I congratulate you. Meanwhile, I shall sit here through all the hot
summer, daubing at your pictures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, take your time about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Do them at your
convenience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked farther and looked at a dozen other things. Newman pointed
out what pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and Mademoiselle Noémie generally criticised it,
and proposed something else. Then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) diverged and began to
talk about some personal matter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What made you speak to me the other day in the Salon Carré?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
abruptly asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I admired your picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you hesitated a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do nothing rashly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw you watching me. But I never supposed you were going to
speak to me. I never dreamed I should be walking about here with you
to-day. It's very curious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very natural,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>observed Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I beg your pardon; not to me. Coquette as you think me, I have
never walked about in public with a gentleman before. What was my father
thinking of, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consented to our interview?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was repenting of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unjust accusations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>replied Newman.

<p/>Mademoiselle Noémie remained silent; at last she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dropped into a seat.
<div class="bookquote">``Well then, for those five it is fixed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Five copies as
brilliant and beautiful as I can make them. We have one more to choose.
Shouldn't you like one of those great Rubenses--the marriage of Marie de
Médicis? Just look at it and see how handsome it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes; I should like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Finish off with that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Finish off with that--good!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat a moment, looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suddenly rose and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands
hanging and clasped in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said
with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand how a man can be so ignorant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am ignorant, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's ridiculous! I don't know how to paint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know how?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I paint like a cat; I can't draw a straight line. I never sold a
picture until you bought that thing the other day.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) offered
this surprising information she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued to smile.

<p/>Newman burst into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you tell me this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because it irritates me to see a clever man blunder so. My pictures are
grotesque.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And the one I possess--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That one is rather worse than usual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I like it all the same!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) askance. <div class="bookquote">``That is a very pretty thing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
answered; <div class="bookquote">``but it is my duty to warn you before you go farther. This
order of yours is impossible, you know. What do you take me for? It is
work for ten men. You pick out the six most difficult pictures in the
Louvre, and you expect me to go to work as if I were sitting down to hem
a dozen pocket handkerchiefs. I wanted to see how far you would go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at the young girl in some perplexity. In spite of the
ridiculous blunder of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood convicted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was very far from
being a simpleton, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a lively suspicion that Mademoiselle
Noémie's sudden frankness was not essentially more honest than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in error would have been. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was playing a game; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
was not simply taking pity on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) æsthetic verdancy. What was it she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
expected to win? The stakes were high and the risk was great; the prize
therefore must have been commensurate. But even granting that the prize
might be great, Newman could not resist a movement of admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
companion's intrepidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was throwing away with one hand, whatever
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might intend to do with the other, a very handsome sum of money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or are you serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, serious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>cried Mademoiselle Noémie, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) extraordinary
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know very little about pictures or how they are painted. If you can't
do all that, of course you can't. Do what you can, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``if you are determined it shall be bad, of
course it will. But why do you go on painting badly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can do nothing else; I have no real talent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are deceiving your father, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The young girl hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows very well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared; <div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) believes in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is afraid of me. I go on painting badly, as you say, because I want
to learn. I like it, at any rate. And I like being here; it is a place
to come to, every day; it is better than sitting in a little dark, damp
room, on a court, or selling buttons and whalebones over a counter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is much more amusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But for a poor girl
isn't it rather an expensive amusement?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am very wrong, there is no doubt about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle
Noémie. <div class="bookquote">``But rather than earn my living as some girls do--toiling with
a needle, in little black holes, out of the world--I would throw myself
into the Seine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no need of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered; <div class="bookquote">``your father told you my
offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants you to marry, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I would give you a chance to earn
your _dot_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me all about it, and you see the account I make of it! Why
should you take such an interest in my marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My interest was in your father. I hold to my offer; do what you can,
and I will buy what you paint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood for some time, meditating, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes on the ground.
At last, looking up, <div class="bookquote">``What sort of a husband can you get for twelve
thousand francs?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your father tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knows some very good young men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grocers and butchers and little _maîtres de cafés!_ I will not marry at
all if I can't marry well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would advise you not to be too fastidious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That's all
the advice I can give you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much vexed at what I have said!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the young girl. <div class="bookquote">``It
has done me no good. But I couldn't help it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What good did you expect it to do you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it, simply.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Well, your pictures may be bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``but you are too clever for me, nevertheless. I don't understand
you. Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made no response, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) no farewell. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) turned away and
seated herself sidewise on a bench, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hand, which clasped the rail in front of the pictures. Newman stood a
moment and then turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heel and retreated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had understood her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) confessed; this singular scene was a practical commentary
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father's statement that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a frank coquette.



<p/>CHAPTER V

<p/>When Newman related to Mrs. Tristram his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fruitless visit to Madame de
Cintré, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) not to be discouraged, but to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) plan
of <div class="bookquote">``seeing Europe''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>during the summer, and return to Paris in the autumn
and settle down comfortably for the winter. <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré will
keep,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is not a woman who will marry from one day to
another.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Newman made no distinct affirmation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would come back
to Paris; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) even talked about Rome and the Nile, and abstained from
professing any especial interest in Madame de Cintré's continued
widowhood. This circumstance was at variance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) habitual
frankness, and may perhaps be regarded as characteristic of the
incipient stage of that passion which is more particularly known as the
mysterious one. The truth is that the expression of a pair of eyes that
were at once brilliant and mild had become very familiar to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) memory,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not easily have resigned himself to the prospect of never
looking into them again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) communicated to Mrs. Tristram a number of
other facts, of greater or less importance, as you choose; but on this
particular point he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own counsel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took a kindly leave of
M. Nioche, having assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was concerned, the
blue-cloaked Madonna herself might have been present at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
interview with Mademoiselle Noémie; and left the old man nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
breast-pocket, in an ecstasy which the acutest misfortune might have
been defied to dissipate. Newman then started on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) travels, with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) usual appearance of slow-strolling leisure, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) essential
directness and intensity of aim. No man seemed less in a hurry, and
yet no man achieved more in brief periods. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had certain practical
instincts which served him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excellently in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trade of tourist. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way in foreign cities by divination, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory was excellent when
once his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention had been at all cordially given, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emerged from
dialogues in foreign tongues, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, formally, not understood
a word, in full possession of the particular fact he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had desired to
ascertain. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appetite for facts was capacious, and although many of
those which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noted would have seemed woefully dry and colorless to the
ordinary sentimental traveler, a careful inspection of the list would
have shown that he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) had a soft spot in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) imagination. In the charming
city of Brussels--his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) first stopping-place after leaving Paris--he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>)
asked a great many questions about the street-cars, and took extreme
satisfaction in the reappearance of this familiar symbol of American
civilization; but he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) was also greatly struck with the beautiful Gothic
tower of the Hôtel de Ville, and wondered whether it would not be
possible to <div class="bookquote">``get up''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>something like it in San Francisco. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) stood for
half an hour in the crowded square before this edifice, in imminent
danger from carriage-wheels, listening to a toothless old cicerone
mumble in broken English the touching history of Counts Egmont and Horn;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) wrote the names of these gentlemen--for reasons best known to
himself--on the back of an old letter.

<p/>At the outset, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) leaving Paris, his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) curiosity had not been intense;
passive entertainment, in the Champs Élysées and at the theatres, seemed
about as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) need expect of himself, and although, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) had said
to Tristram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) wanted to see the mysterious, satisfying _best_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) had
not the Grand Tour in the least on his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) conscience, and was not given to
cross-questioning the amusement of the hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) believed that Europe
was made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>), and not he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) for Europe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) wanted
to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) would have felt a certain embarrassment, a
certain shame, even--a false shame, possibly--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Horn</b></font>) had caught himself
looking intellectually into the mirror. Neither in this nor in any other
respect had Newman a high sense of responsibility; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) prime
conviction that a man's life should be easy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should be able
to resolve privilege into a matter of course. The world, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sense,
was a great bazaar, where one might stroll about and purchase handsome
things; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was no more conscious, individually, of social pressure
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) admitted the existence of such a thing as an obligatory
purchase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not only a dislike, but a sort of moral mistrust,
of uncomfortable thoughts, and it was both uncomfortable and slightly
contemptible to feel obliged to square one's self with a standard.
One's standard was the ideal of one's own good-humored prosperity, the
prosperity which enabled one to give as well as take. To expand,
without bothering about it--without shiftless timidity on one side, or
loquacious eagerness on the other--to the full compass of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
would have called a <div class="bookquote">``pleasant''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>experience, was Newman's most definite
programme of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had always hated to hurry to catch railroad
trains, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had always caught them; and just so an undue
solicitude for <div class="bookquote">``culture''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>seemed a sort of silly dawdling at the
station, a proceeding properly confined to women, foreigners, and other
unpractical persons. All this admitted, Newman enjoyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) journey,
when once he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had fairly entered the current, as profoundly as the most
zealous _dilettante_. One's theories, after all, matter little; it is
one's humor that is the great thing. Our friend was intelligent, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not help that. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lounged through Belgium and Holland and
the Rhineland, through Switzerland and Northern Italy, planning about
nothing, but seeing everything. The guides and _valets de place_ found
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) an excellent subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was always approachable, for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was much
addicted to standing about in the vestibules and porticos of inns, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) availed himself little of the opportunities for impressive seclusion
which are so liberally offered in Europe to gentlemen who travel
with long purses. When an excursion, a church, a gallery, a ruin, was
proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), the first thing Newman usually did, after surveying
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) postulant in silence, from head to foot, was to sit down at a little
table and order something to drink. The cicerone, during this process,
usually retreated to a respectful distance; otherwise I am not sure that
Newman would not have bidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sit down and have a glass also, and
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as an honest fellow whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) church or his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gallery was
really worth a man's trouble. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rose and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) long
legs, beckoned to the man of monuments, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) watch, and
fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eye on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) adversary. <div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``How far?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
whatever the answer was, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sometimes seemed to hesitate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
never declined. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stepped into an open cab, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) conductor sit
beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to answer questions, bade the driver go fast -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had a
particular aversion to slow driving-RRB- and rolled, in all probability
through a dusty suburb, to the goal of his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) pilgrimage. If the goal was a
disappointment, if the church was meagre, or the ruin a heap of rubbish,
Newman never protested or berated his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cicerone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked with an
impartial eye upon great monuments and small, made the guide recite his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
lesson, listened to it religiously, asked if there was nothing else to
be seen in the neighborhood, and drove back again at a rattling pace.
It is to be feared that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perception of the difference between good
architecture and bad was not acute, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might sometimes have
been seen gazing with culpable serenity at inferior productions. Ugly
churches were a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pastime in Europe, as well as beautiful
ones, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tour was altogether a pastime. But there is sometimes
nothing like the imagination of these people who have none, and Newman,
now and then, in an unguided stroll in a foreign city, before some
lonely, sad-towered church, or some angular image of one who had
rendered civic service in an unknown past, had felt a singular inward
tremor. It was not an excitement or a perplexity; it was a placid,
fathomless sense of diversion.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) encountered by chance in Holland a young American, with whom, for
a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) formed a sort of traveler's partnership. They were men of a
very different cast, but each, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way, was so good a fellow that,
for a few weeks at least, it seemed something of a pleasure to share
the chances of the road. Newman's comrade, whose name was Babcock, was
a young Unitarian minister, a small, spare, neatly-attired man, with
a strikingly candid physiognomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a native of Dorchester,
Massachusetts, and had spiritual charge of a small congregation in
another suburb of the New England metropolis. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) digestion was weak and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived chiefly on Graham bread and hominy--a regimen to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
so much attached that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tour seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) destined to be blighted
when, on landing on the Continent, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that these delicacies did
not flourish under the _table d’hôte_ system. In Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had purchased
a bag of hominy at an establishment which called itself an American
Agency, and at which the New York illustrated papers were also to
be procured, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had carried it about with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and shown extreme
serenity and fortitude in the somewhat delicate position of having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
hominy prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and served at anomalous hours, at the hotels he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
successively visited. Newman had once spent a morning, in the course of
business, at Mr. Babcock's birthplace, and, for reasons too recondite
to unfold, his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) visit there always assumed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) mind a jocular cast.
To carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) joke, which certainly seems poor so long as it is
not explained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) used often to address his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) companion as <div class="bookquote">``Dorchester.''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>Fellow-travelers very soon grow intimate but it is highly improbable
that at home these extremely dissimilar characters would have found any
very convenient points of contact. They were, indeed, as different as
possible. Newman, who never reflected on such matters, accepted the
situation with great equanimity, but Babcock used to meditate over
it privately; used often, indeed, to retire to his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) room early in the
evening for the express purpose of considering it conscientiously
and impartially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was not sure that it was a good thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) to
associate with our hero, whose way of taking life was so little his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) own.
Newman was an excellent, generous fellow; Mr. Babcock sometimes said to
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was a _noble_ fellow, and, certainly, it was impossible
not to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>). But would it not be desirable to try to exert an
influence upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>), to try to quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) moral life and sharpen his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
sense of duty? He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) liked everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) accepted everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) found
amusement in everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was not discriminating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had not a high
tone. The young man from Dorchester accused Newman of a fault which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
considered very grave, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) best to avoid: what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
have called a want of <div class="bookquote">``moral reaction.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poor Mr. Babcock was extremely
fond of pictures and churches, and carried Mrs. Jameson's works about
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) trunk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) delighted in æsthetic analysis, and received peculiar
impressions from everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) saw. But nevertheless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) secret soul
he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) detested Europe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) felt an irritating need to protest against
Newman's gross intellectual hospitality. Mr. Babcock's moral _malaise_,
I am afraid, lay deeper than where any definition of mine can reach it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) mistrusted the European temperament, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) suffered from the European
climate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) hated the European dinner-hour; European life seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
unscrupulous and impure. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had an exquisite sense of beauty;
and as beauty was often inextricably associated with the above
displeasing conditions, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) wished, above all, to be just and
dispassionate, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was, furthermore, extremely devoted to
<div class="bookquote">``culture,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) could not bring himself to decide that Europe was utterly
bad. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) thought it was very bad indeed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) quarrel with Newman
was that this unregulated epicure had a sadly insufficient perception
of the bad. Babcock himself really knew as little about the bad, in any
quarter of the world, as a nursing infant, his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) most vivid realization of
evil had been the discovery that one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) college classmates, who was
studying architecture in Paris had a love affair with a young woman who
did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Babcock had related this incident to
Newman, and our hero had applied an epithet of an unflattering sort to
the young girl. The next day his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had used exactly the right word to characterize the young
architect's mistress. Newman stared and laughed. <div class="bookquote">``There are a great many
words to express that idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you can take your choice!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>said Babcock, <div class="bookquote">``was she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) possibly not to be considered in
a different light? Don't you think she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) _really_ expected him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to marry
her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Very likely she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) did; I have no
doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is a grand woman.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) began to laugh again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't mean that either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>said Babcock, <div class="bookquote">``I was only afraid that I
might have seemed yesterday not to remember--not to consider; well, I
think I will write to Percival about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had written to Percival -LRB-who answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) in a really impudent
fashion-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had reflected that it was somehow, raw and reckless in
Newman to assume in that off-hand manner that the young woman in Paris
might be <div class="bookquote">``grand.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>The brevity of Newman's judgments very often shocked
and discomposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a way of damning people without farther
appeal, or of pronouncing them capital company in the face of
uncomfortable symptoms, which seemed unworthy of a man whose conscience
had been properly cultivated. And yet poor Babcock liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>), and
remembered that even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was sometimes perplexing and painful, this
was not a reason for giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) up. Goethe recommended seeing human
nature in the most various forms, and Mr. Babcock thought Goethe
perfectly splendid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) often tried, in odd half-hours of conversation
to infuse into Newman a little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own spiritual starch, but Newman's
personal texture was too loose to admit of stiffening. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mind could no
more hold principles than a sieve can hold water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) admired principles
extremely, and thought Babcock a mighty fine little fellow for having
so many. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) accepted all that his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) high-strung companion offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>),
and put them away in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) supposed to be a very safe place; but poor
Babcock never afterwards recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) gifts among the articles that
Newman had in daily use.

<p/>They traveled together through Germany and into Switzerland, where
for three or four weeks they trudged over passes and lounged upon blue
lakes. At last they crossed the Simplon and made their way to Venice.
Mr. Babcock had become gloomy and even a trifle irritable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) seemed
moody, absent, preoccupied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) plans into a tangle, and talked
one moment of doing one thing and the next of doing another. Newman led
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) usual life, made acquaintances, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ease in the galleries and
churches, spent an unconscionable amount of time in strolling in the
Piazza San Marco, bought a great many bad pictures, and for a fortnight
enjoyed Venice grossly. One evening, coming back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Marco</b></font>) inn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Marco</b></font>) found
Babcock waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) in the little garden beside it. The young man
walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>), looking very dismal, thrust out his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) hand, and said
with solemnity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was afraid they must part. Newman expressed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) surprise and regret, and asked why a parting had become necessary.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid I'm tired of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not tired of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>demanded Babcock, fixing him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) clear
gray eye.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why the deuce should I be? You are a very plucky fellow. Besides, I
don't grow tired of things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't understand each other,''  (<font color='red'><b>the minister</b></font>)</div>said the young minister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't I understand you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I hoped I did. But what if
I don't; where's the harm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>said Babcock. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) sat down and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) hand, and looked up mournfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) immeasurable friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh Lord, I don't mind that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's very distressing to me. It keeps me in a state of unrest. It
irritates me; I can't settle anything. I don't think it's good for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You worry too much; that's what's the matter with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it must seem so to you. You think I take things too hard, and
I think you take things too easily. We can never agree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we have agreed very well all along.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I haven't agreed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>said Babcock, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I am very
uncomfortable. I ought to have separated from you a month ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, horrors! I'll agree to anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman.

<p/>Mr. Babcock buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) head in both hands. At last looking up, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think you appreciate my position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I try to arrive at the
truth about everything. And then you go too fast. For me, you are too
passionate, too extravagant. I feel as if I ought to go over all this
ground we have traversed again, by myself, alone. I am afraid I have
made a great many mistakes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you needn't give so many reasons,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You are simply
tired of my company. You have a good right to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I am not tired!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the pestered young divine. <div class="bookquote">``It is very
wrong to be tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I give it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>laughed Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But of course it will never do to go
on making mistakes. Go your way, by all means. I shall miss you; but you
have seen I make friends very easily. You will be lonely yourself;
but drop me a line, when you feel like it, and I will wait for you
anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I will go back to Milan. I am afraid I didn't do justice to
Luini.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Luini!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean that I am afraid I overestimated him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). I don't think that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a
painter of the first rank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Luini?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``why, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s enchanting--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s magnificent!
There is something in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) genius that is like a beautiful woman. It
gives one the same feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Babcock frowned and winced. And it must be added that this was, for
Newman, an unusually metaphysical flight; but in passing through Milan
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had taken a great fancy to the painter. <div class="bookquote">``There you are again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Babcock/Mr. Babcock</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Babcock. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we had better separate.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And on the morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) steps and proceeded to tone down his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) impressions of the
great Lombard artist.

<p/>A few days afterwards Newman received a note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) late companion
which ran as follows:--

<p/>My Dear Mr. Newman,--I am afraid that my conduct at Venice, a week ago,
seemed to you strange and ungrateful, and I wish to explain my position,
which, as I said at the time, I do not think you appreciate. I had long
had it on my mind to propose that we should part company, and this step
was not really so abrupt as it seemed. In the first place, you know, I
am traveling in Europe on funds supplied by my congregation, who kindly
offered me a vacation and an opportunity to enrich my mind with the
treasures of nature and art in the Old World. I feel, therefore, as if I
ought to use my time to the very best advantage. I have a high sense of
responsibility. You appear to care only for the pleasure of the hour,
and you give yourself up to it with a violence which I confess I am not
able to emulate. I feel as if I must arrive at some conclusion and fix
my belief on certain points. Art and life seem to me intensely serious
things, and in our travels in Europe we should especially remember the
immense seriousness of Art. You seem to hold that if a thing amuses you
for the moment, that is all you need ask for it, and your relish for
mere amusement is also much higher than mine. You put, however, a kind
of reckless confidence into your pleasure which at times, I confess, has
seemed to me--shall I say it?--almost cynical. Your way at any rate is
not my way, and it is unwise that we should attempt any longer to pull
together. And yet, let me add that I know there is a great deal to be
said for your way; I have felt its attraction, in your society, very
strongly. But for this I should have left you long ago. But I was so
perplexed. I hope I have not done wrong. I feel as if I had a great deal
of lost time to make up. I beg you take all this as I mean it, which,
Heaven knows, is not invidiously. I have a great personal esteem for you
and hope that some day, when I have recovered my balance, we shall
meet again. I hope you will continue to enjoy your travels, only _do_
remember that Life and Art _are_ extremely serious. Believe me your
sincere friend and well-wisher,

<p/>BENJAMIN BABCOCK

<p/>P. S. I am greatly perplexed by Luini.

<p/>This letter produced in Newman's mind a singular mixture of exhilaration
and awe. At first, Mr. Babcock's tender conscience seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) a
capital farce, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) traveling back to Milan only to get into a
deeper muddle appeared, as the reward of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) pedantry, exquisitely and
ludicrously just. Then Newman reflected that these are mighty mysteries,
that possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) himself was indeed that baleful and barely mentionable
thing, a cynic, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) manner of considering the treasures of art
and the privileges of life was probably very base and immoral. Newman
had a great contempt for immorality, and that evening, for a good half
hour, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat watching the star-sheen on the warm Adriatic, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt
rebuked and depressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was at a loss how to answer Babcock's letter.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) good nature checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) resenting the young minister's lofty
admonitions, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) tough, inelastic sense of humor forbade his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) taking
them seriously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) wrote no answer at all but a day or two afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
found in a curiosity shop a grotesque little statuette in ivory, of the
sixteenth century, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) sent off to Babcock without a commentary. It
represented a gaunt, ascetic-looking monk, in a tattered gown and cowl,
kneeling with clasped hands and pulling a portentously long face. It was
a wonderfully delicate piece of carving, and in a moment, through one
of the rents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) gown, you espied a fat capon hung round the monk's
waist. In Newman's intention what did the figure symbolize? Did it mean
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was going to try to be as <div class="bookquote">``high-toned''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the monk looked at
first, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should succeed no better than the friar, on
a closer inspection, proved to have done? It is not supposable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
intended a satire upon Babcock's own asceticism, for this would have
been a truly cynical stroke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) late companion, at any rate, a
very valuable little present.

<p/>Newman, on leaving Venice, went through the Tyrol to Vienna, and then
returned westward, through Southern Germany. The autumn found him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at
Baden-Baden, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spent several weeks. The place was charming, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was in no hurry to depart; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and
deciding what to do for the winter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) summer had been very full, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat under the great trees beside the miniature river that trickles
past the Baden flower-beds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) slowly rummaged it over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen and
done a great deal, enjoyed and observed a great deal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt older,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt younger too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remembered Mr. Babcock and his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) desire
to form conclusions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) remembered also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had profited very
little by his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) friend's exhortation to cultivate the same respectable
habit. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) not scrape together a few conclusions? Baden-Baden
was the prettiest place he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had seen yet, and orchestral music in the
evening, under the stars, was decidedly a great institution. This was
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) conclusions! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) went on to reflect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had done very
wisely to pull up stakes and come abroad; this seeing of the world was
a very interesting thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had learned a great deal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) couldn't say
just what, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had it there under his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) hat-band. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
wanted; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had seen the great things, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) mind a chance
to <div class="bookquote">``improve,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>if it would. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) cheerfully believed that it had improved.
Yes, this seeing of the world was very pleasant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) would willingly
do a little more of it. Thirty-six years old as he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had a
handsome stretch of life before him (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) yet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) need not begin to
count his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) weeks. Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) take the world next? I have said he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
remembered the eyes of the lady whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had found standing in Mrs.
Tristram's drawing-room; four months had elapsed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had not
forgotten them yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had looked--he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had made a point of looking--into
a great many other eyes in the interval, but the only ones he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) thought
of now were Madame de Cintré's. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) wanted to see more of the world,
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) find it in Madame de Cintré's eyes? He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) would certainly find
something there, call it this world or the next. Throughout these rather
formless meditations he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) sometimes thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) past life and the long
array of years -LRB-they had begun so early-RRB- during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had had nothing
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) head but <div class="bookquote">``enterprise.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They seemed far away now, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) present
attitude was more than a holiday, it was almost a rupture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had told
Tristram that the pendulum was swinging back and it appeared that the
backward swing had not yet ended. Still <div class="bookquote">``enterprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which was over
in the other quarter wore to his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) mind a different aspect at different
hours. In its train a thousand forgotten episodes came trooping back
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) memory. Some of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) looked complacently enough in the face;
from some he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) head. They were old efforts, old exploits,
antiquated examples of <div class="bookquote">``smartness''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and sharpness. Some of them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>)
looked at them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) felt decidedly proud of; he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) admired himself as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) had been looking at another man. And, in fact, many of the qualities
that make a great deed were there: the decision, the resolution, the
courage, the celerity, the clear eye, and the strong hand. Of certain
other achievements it would be going too far to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Babcock</b></font>) was ashamed
of them for Newman had never had a stomach for dirty work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
blessed with a natural impulse to disfigure with a direct, unreasoning
blow the comely visage of temptation. And certainly, in no man could a
want of integrity have been less excusable. Newman knew the crooked from
the straight at a glance, and the former had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), first and last,
a great many moments of lively disgust. But none the less some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
memories seemed to wear at present a rather graceless and sordid mien,
and it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never done anything very ugly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
never, on the other hand, done anything particularly beautiful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) years in the unremitting effort to add thousands to thousands,
and, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood well outside of it, the business of money-getting
appeared tolerably dry and sterile. It is very well to sneer at
money-getting after you have filled your pockets, and Newman, it may be
said, should have begun somewhat earlier to moralize thus delicately. To
this it may be answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might have made another fortune, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
chose; and we ought to add that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not exactly moralizing. It had
come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been looking at all summer was
a very rich and beautiful world, and that it had not all been made by
sharp railroad men and stock-brokers.

<p/>During his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stay at Baden-Baden he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) received a letter from Mrs. Tristram,
scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for the scanty tidings he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had sent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friends of the
Avenue d’Iéna, and begging to be definitely informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not
concocted any horrid scheme for wintering in outlying regions, but was
coming back sanely and promptly to the most comfortable city in the
world. Newman's answer ran as follows:--

<p/>``I supposed you knew I was a miserable letter-writer, and didn't expect
anything of me. I don't think I have written twenty letters of pure
friendship in my whole life; in America I conducted my correspondence
altogether by telegrams. This is a letter of pure friendship; you have
got hold of a curiosity, and I hope you will value it. You want to know
everything that has happened to me these three months. The best way to
tell you, I think, would be to send you my half dozen guide-books, with
my pencil-marks in the margin. Wherever you find a scratch or a cross,
or a `Beautiful!' or a `So true!' or a `Too thin!' you may know that
I have had a sensation of some sort or other. That has been about my
history, ever since I left you. Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Germany,
Italy--I have been through the whole list, and I don't think I am any
the worse for it. I know more about Madonnas and church-steeples than I
supposed any man could. I have seen some very pretty things, and shall
perhaps talk them over this winter, by your fireside. You see, my face
is not altogether set against Paris. I have had all kinds of plans and
visions, but your letter has blown most of them away. `_L’appétit vient
en mangeant_,' says the French proverb, and I find that the more I see
of the world the more I want to see. Now that I am in the shafts, why
shouldn't I trot to the end of the course? Sometimes I think of the
far East, and keep rolling the names of Eastern cities under my tongue:
Damascus and Bagdad, Medina and Mecca. I spent a week last month in the
company of a returned missionary, who told me I ought to be ashamed to
be loafing about Europe when there are such big things to be seen out
there. I do want to explore, but I think I would rather explore over in
the Rue de l’Université. Do you ever hear from that pretty lady? If you
can get her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to promise she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be at home the next time I call, I will
go back to Paris straight. I am more than ever in the state of mind I
told you about that evening; I want a first-class wife. I have kept an
eye on all the pretty girls I have come across this summer, but none of
them came up to my notion, or anywhere near it. I should have enjoyed
all this a thousand times more if I had had the lady just mentioned
by my side. The nearest approach to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a Unitarian minister from
Boston, who very soon demanded a separation, for incompatibility of
temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) told me I was low-minded, immoral, a devotee of `art for
art'--whatever that is: all of which greatly afflicted me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>)
was really a sweet little fellow. But shortly afterwards I met an
Englishman, with whom I struck up an acquaintance which at first seemed
to promise well--a very bright man, who writes in the London papers
and knows Paris nearly as well as Tristram. We knocked about for a week
together, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very soon gave me up in disgust. I was too virtuous by
half; I was too stern a moralist. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me, in a friendly way, that I
was cursed with a conscience; that I judged things like a Methodist and
talked about them like an old lady. This was rather bewildering. Which
of my two critics was I to believe? I didn't worry about it and very
soon made up my mind they were both idiots. But there is one thing in
which no one will ever have the impudence to pretend I am wrong, that
is, in being your faithful friend,

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER VI

<p/>Newman gave up Damascus and Bagdad and returned to Paris before the
autumn was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) established himself in some rooms selected for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
by Tom Tristram, in accordance with the latter's estimate of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
called his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) social position. When Newman learned that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) social position
was to be taken into account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) professed himself utterly incompetent,
and begged Tristram to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of the care. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know I had a
social position,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and if I have, I haven't the smallest idea
what it is. Isn't a social position knowing some two or three thousand
people and inviting them to dinner? I know you and your wife and little
old Mr. Nioche, who gave me French lessons last spring. Can I invite you
to dinner to meet each other? If I can, you must come to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not very grateful to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``who introduced
you last year to every creature I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you did; I had quite forgotten. But I thought you wanted me to
forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with that tone of simple deliberateness which
frequently marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) utterance, and which an observer would not have
known whether to pronounce a somewhat mysteriously humorous affection of
ignorance or a modest aspiration to knowledge; <div class="bookquote">``you told me you disliked
them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an observer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, the way you remember what I say is at least very flattering. But
in future,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``pray forget all the wicked things and
remember only the good ones. It will be easily done, and it will not
fatigue your memory. But I forewarn you that if you trust my husband to
pick out your rooms, you are in for something hideous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hideous, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-day I must say nothing wicked; otherwise I should use stronger
language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) would say, Newman?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)
really tried, now? She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) can express displeasure, volubly, in two or three
languages; that's what it is to be intellectual. It gives her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) the start
of me completely, for I can't swear, for the life of me, except in
English. When I get mad I have to fall back on our dear old mother
tongue. There's nothing like it, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew nothing about tables and chairs, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would accept, in the way of a lodging, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes shut, anything
that Tristram should offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). This was partly veracity on our hero's
part, but it was also partly charity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew that to pry about and look
at rooms, and make people open windows, and poke into sofas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
cane, and gossip with landladies, and ask who lived above and who
below--he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew that this was of all pastimes the dearest to Tristram's
heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt the more disposed to put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
conscious that, as regards his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) obliging friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had suffered the
warmth of ancient good-fellowship somewhat to abate. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no
taste for upholstery; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had even no very exquisite sense of comfort
or convenience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a relish for luxury and splendor, but it was
satisfied by rather gross contrivances. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) scarcely knew a hard chair
from a soft one, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) possessed a talent for stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs which
quite dispensed with adventitious facilities. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) idea of comfort was to
inhabit very large rooms, have a great many of them, and be conscious of
their possessing a number of patented mechanical devices--half of which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should never have occasion to use. The apartments should be light and
brilliant and lofty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had once said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked rooms in which you
wanted to keep your hat on. For the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was satisfied with the
assurance of any respectable person that everything was <div class="bookquote">``handsome.''
 (<font color='red'><b>any person</b></font>)</div>Tristram accordingly secured for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) an apartment to which this epithet
might be lavishly applied. It was situated on the Boulevard Haussmann,
on the first floor, and consisted of a series of rooms, gilded from
floor to ceiling a foot thick, draped in various light shades of satin,
and chiefly furnished with mirrors and clocks. Newman thought them
magnificent, thanked Tristram heartily, immediately took possession, and
had one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) trunks standing for three months in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) drawing-room.

<p/>One day Mrs. Tristram told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) beautiful friend, Madame de
Cintré, had returned from the country; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) three days
before, coming out of the Church of St. Sulpice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) herself having
journeyed to that distant quarter in quest of an obscure lace-mender, of
whose skill she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had heard high praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how were those eyes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Those eyes were red with weeping, if you please!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been to confession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't tally with your account of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
should have sins to confess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were not sins; they were sufferings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked me to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); I went this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffer from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). With her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), somehow, one is very discreet. But I
guessed, easily enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffers from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wicked old mother and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
Grand Turk of a brother. They persecute her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). But I can almost forgive
them, because, as I told you, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a saint, and a persecution is all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) needs to bring out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saintliness and make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a comfortable theory for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I hope you will never impart it
to the old folks. Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) let them bully her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
mistress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Legally, yes, I suppose; but morally, no. In France you must never say
nay to your mother, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) requires of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may be the most
abominable old woman in the world, and make your life a purgatory; but,
after all, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is _ma mère_, and you have no right to judge her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). You
have simply to obey. The thing has a fine side to it. Madame de Cintré
bows her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head and folds her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at least make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother leave off?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother is the _chef de la famille_, as they say; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is the head of
the clan. With those people the family is everything; you must act, not
for your own pleasure, but for the advantage of the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what _my_ family would like me to do!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you had one!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what do they want to get out of that poor lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Another marriage. They are not rich, and they want to bring more money
into the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's your chance, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Madame de Cintré objects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has been sold once; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) naturally objects to being sold again.
It appears that the first time they made rather a poor bargain; M. de
Cintré left a scanty property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to whom do they want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it best not to ask; but you may be sure it is to some horrid
old nabob, or to some dissipated little duke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's Mrs. Tristram, as large as life!''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``Observe
the richness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) has not a single question--it's
vulgar to ask questions--and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knows everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) has the
history of Madame de Cintré's marriage at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fingers' ends. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) has
seen the lovely Claire on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knees, with loosened tresses and streaming
eyes, and the rest of them standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) with spikes and goads and
red-hot irons, ready to come down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) refuses the tipsy duke.
The simple truth is that they made a fuss about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) milliner's bill or
refused her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) an opera-box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked from Tristram to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife with a certain mistrust in each
direction. <div class="bookquote">``Do you really mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked of Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that your
friend is being forced into an unhappy marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it extremely probable. Those people are very capable of that
sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is like something in a play,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that dark old house over
there looks as if wicked things had been done in it, and might be done
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have a still darker old house in the country Madame de Cintré
tells me, and there, during the summer this scheme must have been
hatched.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Must_ have been; mind that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>suggested Newman, after a silence, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) may be in trouble
about something else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is something else, then it is something worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tristram, with rich decision.

<p/>Newman was silent a while, and seemed lost in meditation. <div class="bookquote">``Is it
possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked at last, <div class="bookquote">``that they do that sort of thing over here?
that helpless women are bullied into marrying men they hate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Helpless women, all over the world, have a hard time of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``There is plenty of bullying everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great deal of that kind of thing goes on in New York,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Tristram.
<div class="bookquote">``Girls are bullied or coaxed or bribed, or all three together, into
marrying nasty fellows. There is no end of that always going on in the
Fifth Avenue, and other bad things besides. The Mysteries of the Fifth
Avenue! Someone ought to show them up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, very gravely. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that,
in America, girls are ever subjected to compulsion. I don't believe
there have been a dozen cases of it since the country began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to the voice of the spread eagle!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The spread eagle ought to use his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) wings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``Fly to
the rescue of Madame de Cintré!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) rescue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pounce down, seize her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) in your talons, and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) off. Marry her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, for some moments, answered nothing; but presently, <div class="bookquote">``I should
suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) had heard enough of marrying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``The kindest way to
treat her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) would be to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>), and yet never to speak of it. But that
sort of thing is infamous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``it makes me feel savage to hear
of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard of it, however, more than once afterward. Mrs. Tristram again
saw Madame de Cintré, and again found her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looking very sad. But on these
occasions there had been no tears; her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) beautiful eyes were clear and
still. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) is cold, calm, and hopeless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram declared, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) added that on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) mentioning that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend Mr. Newman was again
in Paris and was faithful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) desire to make Madame de Cintré's
acquaintance, this lovely woman had found a smile in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) despair, and
declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sorry to have missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) visit in the spring and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had not lost courage. <div class="bookquote">``I told her (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) something about
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a comfort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, placidly. <div class="bookquote">``I like people to know about
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A few days after this, one dusky autumn afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went again to the
Rue de l’Université. The early evening had closed in as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) applied for
admittance at the stoutly guarded _Hôtel de Bellegarde_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was told
that Madame de Cintré was at home; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) crossed the court, entered the
farther door, and was conducted through a vestibule, vast, dim, and
cold, up a broad stone staircase with an ancient iron balustrade, to
an apartment on the second floor. Announced and ushered in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) found
himself in a sort of paneled boudoir, at one end of which a lady and
gentleman were seated before the fire. The gentleman was smoking a
cigarette; there was no light in the room save that of a couple of
candles and the glow from the hearth. Both persons rose to welcome
Newman, who, in the firelight, recognized Madame de Cintré. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand with a smile which seemed in itself an illumination, and,
pointing to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion, said softly, <div class="bookquote">``My brother.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>The gentleman
offered Newman a frank, friendly greeting, and our hero then perceived
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to be the young man who had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the court of the hotel
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) former visit and who had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as a good fellow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tristram has spoken to me a great deal of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Cintré gently, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) former place.

<p/>Newman, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seated himself, began to consider what, in truth,
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) errand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had an unusual, unexpected sense of having wandered
into a strange corner of the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not given, as a general
thing, to anticipating danger, or forecasting disaster, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had had
no social tremors on this particular occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not timid and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was not impudent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt too kindly toward himself to be the one, and
too good-naturedly toward the rest of the world to be the other. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
native shrewdness sometimes placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ease of temper at its mercy; with
every disposition to take things simply, it was obliged to perceive that
some things were not so simple as others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt as one does in missing
a step, in an ascent, where one expected to find it. This strange,
pretty woman, sitting in fire-side talk with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother, in the gray
depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) inhospitable-looking house--what had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
seemed enveloped in a sort of fantastic privacy; on what grounds had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
pulled away the curtain? For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had plunged into
some medium as deep as the ocean, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must exert himself to
keep from sinking. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was looking at Madame de Cintré, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was settling herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair and drawing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long dress and
turning her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Their eyes met; a moment afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
looked away and motioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother to put a log on the fire. But
the moment, and the glance which traversed it, had been sufficient to
relieve Newman of the first and the last fit of personal embarrassment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was ever to know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) performed the movement which was so frequent
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and which was always a sort of symbol of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) taking mental
possession of a scene--he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs. The impression Madame de
Cintré had made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) on their first meeting came back in an instant;
it had been deeper than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was pleasing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was interesting;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had opened a book and the first lines held his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) several questions: how lately he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen Mrs. Tristram,
how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been in Paris, how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) expected to remain there, how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) spoke English without an accent, or rather with that
distinctively British accent which, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arrival in Europe, had struck
Newman as an altogether foreign tongue, but which, in women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come
to like extremely. Here and there Madame de Cintré's utterance had a
faint shade of strangeness but at the end of ten minutes Newman found
himself waiting for these soft roughnesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) enjoyed them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
marveled to see that gross thing, error, brought down to so fine a
point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a beautiful country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, presently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, magnificent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't travel; especially so far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you go away sometimes; you are not always here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I go away in summer, a little way, to the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman wanted to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) something more, something personal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hardly
knew what. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you find it rather--rather quiet here?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``so far from the street?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Rather <div class="bookquote">``gloomy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was going to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
reflected that that would be impolite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is very quiet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré; <div class="bookquote">``but we like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>repeated Newman, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Besides, I have lived here all my life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lived here all your life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, in the same way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was born here, and my father was born here before me, and my
grandfather, and my great-grandfathers. Were they not, Valentin?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a family habit to be born here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man said with a
laugh, and rose and threw the remnant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cigarette into the fire,
and then remained leaning against the chimney-piece. An observer would
have perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished to take a better look at Newman, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
covertly examined, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) moustache.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your house is tremendously old, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How old is it, brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Cintré.

<p/>The young man took the two candles from the mantel-shelf, lifted one
high in each hand, and looked up toward the cornice of the room, above
the chimney-piece. This latter feature of the apartment was of white
marble, and in the familiar rococo style of the last century; but above
it was a paneling of an earlier date, quaintly carved, painted white,
and gilded here and there. The white had turned to yellow, and the
gilding was tarnished. On the top, the figures ranged themselves into
a sort of shield, on which an armorial device was cut. Above it, in
relief, was a date--1627. <div class="bookquote">``There you have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``That
is old or new, according to your point of view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, over here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``one's point of view gets shifted round
considerably.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head and looked about the room.
<div class="bookquote">``Your house is of a very curious style of architecture,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you interested in architecture?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>asked the young man at the
chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I took the trouble, this summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``to examine--as
well as I can calculate--some four hundred and seventy churches. Do you
call that interested?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are interested in theology,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly. Are you a Roman Catholic, madam?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned to
Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, gravely.

<p/>Newman was struck with the gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head
and began to look round the room again. <div class="bookquote">``Had you never noticed that
number up there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``In former years,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother had been watching Newman's movement. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you would like
to examine the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>Newman slowly brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a vague
impression that the young man at the chimney-piece was inclined to
irony. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a handsome fellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face wore a smile, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustaches
were curled up at the ends, and there was a little dancing gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eye. <div class="bookquote">``Damn his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) French impudence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman was on the point of saying to
himself. <div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) grinning at?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glanced at Madame de
Cintré; she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed on the floor. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised
them, they met his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother. Newman turned again
to this young man and observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strikingly resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sister.
This was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) favor, and our hero's first impression of the Count
Valentin, moreover, had been agreeable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mistrust expired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would be very glad to see the house.

<p/>The young man gave a frank laugh, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on one of the
candlesticks. <div class="bookquote">``Good, good!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Come, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>But Madame de Cintré rose quickly and grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Valentin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What do you mean to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To show Mr. Newman the house. It will be very amusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, and turned to Newman with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) take you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you will not find it amusing. It is a
musty old house, like any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is full of curious things,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the count, resisting. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, I
want to do it; it is a rare chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wicked, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Madame de Cintré answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing venture, nothing have!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man. <div class="bookquote">``Will you come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré stepped toward Newman, gently clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands and
smiling softly. <div class="bookquote">``Would you not prefer my society, here, by my fire, to
stumbling about dark passages after my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A hundred times!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``We will see the house some other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man sir</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) candlestick with mock solemnity, and, shaking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have defeated a great scheme, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man sir</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A scheme? I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have played your part in it all the better. Perhaps some day
I shall have a chance to explain it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quiet, and ring for the tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/>The young man obeyed, and presently a servant brought in the tea, placed
the tray on a small table, and departed. Madame de Cintré, from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
place, busied herself with making it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had but just begun when the
door was thrown open and a lady rushed in, making a loud rustling sound.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stared at Newman, gave a little nod and a <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman</b></font>)</div>and then
quickly approached Madame de Cintré and presented her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead to be
kissed. Madame de Cintré saluted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and continued to make tea. The
new-comer was young and pretty, it seemed to Newman; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bonnet
and cloak, and a train of royal proportions. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began to talk rapidly
in French. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, give me some tea, my beautiful one, for the love of God!
I'm exhausted, mangled, massacred.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman found himself quite unable to
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke much less distinctly than M. Nioche.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my sister-in-law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said the Count Valentin, leaning towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exquisite,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, and this time, again, Newman
suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of irony.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sister-in-law came round to the other side of the fire with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) cup
of tea in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) hand, holding it out at arm's-length, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) might
not spill it on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) dress, and uttering little cries of alarm. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)
placed the cup on the mantel-shelf and begun to unpin her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) veil and pull
off her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) gloves, looking meanwhile at Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything I can do for you, my dear lady?''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>the Count Valentin
asked, in a sort of mock-caressing tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Present monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sister-in-law.

<p/>The young man answered, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Newman!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man Newman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't courtesy to you, monsieur, or I shall spill my tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the
lady. <div class="bookquote">``So Claire receives strangers, like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, in a low
voice, in French, to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apparently!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) answered with a smile. Newman stood a moment, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) approached Madame de Cintré. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were
thinking of something to say. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to think of nothing; so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
simply smiled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat down near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a cup of tea. For
a few moments they talked about that, and meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remembered what Mrs. Tristram had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``perfection''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) having, in combination, all the brilliant things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dreamed
of finding. This made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) not only without mistrust, but
without uneasy conjectures; the presumption, from the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) favor. And yet, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was beautiful, it
was not a dazzling beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was tall and moulded in long lines;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had thick fair hair, a wide forehead, and features with a sort of
harmonious irregularity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) clear gray eyes were strikingly expressive;
they were both gentle and intelligent, and Newman liked them immensely;
but they had not those depths of splendor--those many-colored
rays--which illumine the brows of famous beauties. Madame de Cintré was
rather thin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looked younger than probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) whole
person there was something both youthful and subdued, slender and
yet ample, tranquil yet shy; a mixture of immaturity and repose, of
innocence and dignity. What had Tristram meant, Newman wondered, by
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) proud? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was certainly not proud now, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
was, it was of no use, it was lost upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) must pile it up higher
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to mind it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was a beautiful woman, and it was
very easy to get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a countess, a _marquise_, a kind
of historical formation? Newman, who had rarely heard these words used,
had never been at pains to attach any particular image to them; but they
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) now and seemed charged with a sort of melodious meaning.
They signified something fair and softly bright, that had easy motions
and spoke very agreeably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you many friends in Paris; do you go out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Cintré,
who had at last thought of something to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean do I dance, and all that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you go _dans le monde_ , as we say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen a good many people. Mrs. Tristram has taken me about. I do
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) tells me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By yourself, you are not fond of amusements?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, of some sorts. I am not fond of dancing, and that sort of
thing; I am too old and sober. But I want to be amused; I came to Europe
for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can be amused in America, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't; I was always at work. But after all, that was my
amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Madame de Bellegarde came back for another cup of tea,
accompanied by the Count Valentin. Madame de Cintré, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had served
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), began to talk again with Newman, and recalling what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had last
said, <div class="bookquote">``In your own country you were very much occupied?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was in business. I have been in business since I was fifteen years
old.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what was your business?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Bellegarde, who was
decidedly not so pretty as Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been in everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``At one time I sold leather;
at one time I manufactured wash-tubs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde made a little grimace. <div class="bookquote">``Leather? I don't like that.
Wash-tubs are better. I prefer the smell of soap. I hope at least they
made your fortune.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rattled this off with the air of a woman who had
the reputation of saying everything that came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head, and with a
strong French accent.

<p/>Newman had spoken with cheerful seriousness, but Madame de Bellegarde's
tone made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) go on, after a meditative pause, with a certain light
grimness of jocularity. <div class="bookquote">``No, I lost money on wash-tubs, but I came out
pretty square on leather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have made up my mind, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``that
the great point is--how do you call it?--to come out square. I am on my
knees to money; I don't deny it. If you have it, I ask no questions. For
that I am a real democrat--like you, monsieur. Madame de Cintré is very
proud; but I find that one gets much more pleasure in this sad life if
one doesn't look too close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just Heaven, dear madam, how you go at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Count Valentin</b></font>)</div>said the Count Valentin,
lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>democrat</b></font>)'s a man one can speak to, I suppose, since my sister receives him (<font color='blue'><b>democrat</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the lady answered. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, it's very true; those are my ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you call them ideas,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the young man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Mrs. Tristram told me you had been in the army--in your war,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but that is not business!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``Otherwise perhaps I should not be
penniless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``that you are so proud? I had
already heard it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré smiled. <div class="bookquote">``Do you find me so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I am no judge. If you are proud with me, you will
have to tell me. Otherwise I shall not know it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``That would be pride in a sad
position!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be partly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman went on, <div class="bookquote">``because I shouldn't want to know
it. I want you to treat me well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré, whose laugh had ceased, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head
half averted, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feared what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was going to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tristram told you the literal truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``I want very
much to know you. I didn't come here simply to call to-day; I came in
the hope that you might ask me to come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, pray come often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But will you be at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman insisted. Even to himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed a
trifle <div class="bookquote">``pushing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was, in truth, a trifle excited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/>Newman got up. <div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
coat-cuff.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``invite Mr. Newman to come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>The Count Valentin looked at our hero from head to foot with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
peculiar smile, in which impudence and urbanity seemed perplexingly
commingled. <div class="bookquote">``Are you a brave man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) asked, eying him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) askance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather suspect so. In that case, come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what an invitation!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>murmured Madame de Cintré, with something
painful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I want Mr. Newman to come--particularly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man. <div class="bookquote">``It
will give me great pleasure. I shall be desolate if I miss one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
visits. But I maintain he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) must be brave. A stout heart, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
offered Newman his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not come to see you; I shall come to see Madame de Cintré,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will need all the more courage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Valentin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, appealingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``I am the only person here
capable of saying something polite! Come to see me; you will need no
courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>Newman gave a laugh which was not altogether an assent, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
leave. Madame de Cintré did not take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sister's challenge to be
gracious, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked with a certain troubled air at the retreating
guest.



<p/>CHAPTER VII

<p/>One evening very late, about a week after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) visit to Madame de
Cintré, Newman's servant brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a card. It was that of young M. de
Bellegarde. When, a few moments later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) went to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) visitor,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) standing in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) great gilded parlor and eying
it from cornice to carpet. M. de Bellegarde's face, it seemed to
Newman, expressed a sense of lively entertainment. <div class="bookquote">``What the devil is
he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) laughing at now?''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>our hero asked himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) put the question
without acrimony, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that Madame de Cintré's brother was a good
fellow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had a presentiment that on this basis of good fellowship
they were destined to understand each other. Only, if there was anything
to laugh at, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) wished to have a glimpse of it too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To begin with,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``have I
come too late?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Too late for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To smoke a cigar with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have to come early to do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't smoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are a strong man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I keep cigars,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, I may not smoke here,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? Is the room too small?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too large. It is like smoking in a ball-room, or a church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what you were laughing at just now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked; <div class="bookquote">``the size of
my room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not size only,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>replied M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``but splendor, and
harmony, and beauty of detail. It was the smile of admiration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``So it _is_ very ugly?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugly, my dear sir? It is magnificent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the same thing, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Make yourself
comfortable. Your coming to see me, I take it, is an act of friendship.
You were not obliged to. Therefore, if anything around here amuses you,
it will be all in a pleasant way. Laugh as loud as you please; I like
to see my visitors cheerful. Only, I must make this request: that you
explain the joke to me as soon as you can speak. I don't want to lose
anything, myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde stared, with a look of unresentful perplexity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) laid
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on Newman's sleeve and seemed on the point of saying something,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) suddenly checked himself, leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair, and puffed
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cigar. At last, however, breaking silence,--<div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``my coming to see you is an act of friendship. Nevertheless I was in a
measure obliged to do so. My sister asked me to come, and a request from
my sister is, for me, a law. I was near you, and I observed lights
in what I supposed were your rooms. It was not a ceremonious hour for
making a call, but I was not sorry to do something that would show I was
not performing a mere ceremony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, here I am as large as life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man went on <div class="bookquote">``by giving me
unlimited leave to laugh. Certainly I am a great laugher, and it is
better to laugh too much than too little. But it is not in order that we
may laugh together--or separately--that I have, I may say, sought your
acquaintance. To speak with almost impudent frankness, you interest me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>All this was uttered by M. de Bellegarde with the modulated smoothness
of the man of the world, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) excellent English, of
the Frenchman; but Newman, at the same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat noting its
harmonious flow, perceived that it was not mere mechanical urbanity.
Decidedly, there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked. M. de
Bellegarde was a foreigner to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) finger-tips, and if Newman had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
on a Western prairie he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have felt it proper to address him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a
<div class="bookquote">``How-d’ye-do, Mosseer?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) physiognomy which
seemed to cast a sort of aerial bridge over the impassable gulf produced
by difference of race. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was below the middle height, and robust and
agile in figure. Valentin de Bellegarde, Newman afterwards learned, had
a mortal dread of the robustness overtaking the agility; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was afraid
of growing stout; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was too short, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, to afford a belly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
rode and fenced and practiced gymnastics with unremitting zeal, and if
you greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) with a <div class="bookquote">``How well you are looking''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) started and turned
pale. In your _well_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) read a grosser monosyllable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had a round
head, high above the ears, a crop of hair at once dense and silky, a
broad, low forehead, a short nose, of the ironical and inquiring rather
than of the dogmatic or sensitive cast, and a moustache as delicate as
that of a page in a romance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) resembled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sister not in feature,
but in the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) clear, bright eye, completely void of
introspection, and in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) smiled. The great point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) face
was that it was intensely alive--frankly, ardently, gallantly alive. The
look of it was like a bell, of which the handle might have been in the
young man's soul: at a touch of the handle it rang with a loud, silver
sound. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quick, light brown eye which assured
you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not economizing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not living
in a corner of it to spare the furniture of the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was squarely
encamped in the centre and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was keeping open house. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled, it
was like the movement of a person who in emptying a cup turns it upside
down: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave you the last drop of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jollity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inspired Newman with
something of the same kindness that our hero used to feel in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) earlier
years for those of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) companions who could perform strange and clever
tricks--make their joints crack in queer places or whistle at the back
of their mouths.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister told me,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de Bellegarde continued, <div class="bookquote">``that I ought to come
and remove the impression that I had taken such great pains to produce
upon you; the impression that I am a lunatic. Did it strike you that I
behaved very oddly the other day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rather so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So my sister tells me.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>And M. de Bellegarde watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) host for a
moment through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) smoke-wreaths. <div class="bookquote">``If that is the case, I think we had
better let it stand. I didn't try to make you think I was a lunatic, at
all; on the contrary, I wanted to produce a favorable impression.
But if, after all, I made a fool of myself, it was the intention of
Providence. I should injure myself by protesting too much, for I
should seem to set up a claim for wisdom which, in the sequel of our
acquaintance, I could by no means justify. Set me down as a lunatic with
intervals of sanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I guess you know what you are about,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When I am sane, I am very sane; that I admit,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de Bellegarde
answered. <div class="bookquote">``But I didn't come here to talk about myself. I should like to
ask you a few questions. You allow me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me a specimen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You live here all alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely. With whom should I live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde with a smile <div class="bookquote">``I am asking
questions, not answering them. You have come to Paris for your
pleasure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was silent a while. Then, at last, <div class="bookquote">``Everyone asks me that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mild slowness. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds so awfully foolish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But at any rate you had a reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I came for my pleasure!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Though it is foolish, it is
true.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are enjoying it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>any American</b></font>)</div><p/>Like any other good American, Newman thought it as well not to truckle
to the foreigner. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, so-so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde puffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) cigar again in silence. <div class="bookquote">``For myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I am entirely at your service. Anything I can do for you
I shall be very happy to do. Call upon me at your convenience. Is there
anyone you desire to know--anything you wish to see? It is a pity you
should not enjoy Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I do enjoy it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, good-naturedly. <div class="bookquote">``I'm much obliged to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Honestly speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de Bellegarde went on, <div class="bookquote">``there is something
absurd to me in hearing myself make you these offers. They represent
a great deal of goodwill, but they represent little else. You are a
successful man and I am a failure, and it's a turning of the tables to
talk as if I could lend you a hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way are you a failure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not a tragical failure!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the young man with a laugh.
<div class="bookquote">``I have fallen from a height, and my fiasco has made no noise. You,
evidently, are a success. You have made a fortune, you have built up an
edifice, you are a financial, commercial power, you can travel about
the world until you have found a soft spot, and lie down in it with
the consciousness of having earned your rest. Is not that true? Well,
imagine the exact reverse of all that, and you have me. I have done
nothing--I can do nothing!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long story. Some day I will tell you. Meanwhile, I'm right, eh?
You are a success? You have made a fortune? It's none of my business,
but, in short, you are rich?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's another thing that it sounds foolish to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Hang
it, no man is rich!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard philosophers affirm,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>laughed M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``that
no man was poor; but your formula strikes me as an improvement. As a
general thing, I confess, I don't like successful people, and I find
clever men who have made great fortunes very offensive. They tread on
my toes; they make me uncomfortable. But as soon as I saw you, I said
to myself. `Ah, there is a man with whom I shall get on. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
the good-nature of success and none of the _morgue_; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not our
confoundedly irritable French vanity.' In short, I took a fancy to you.
We are very different, I'm sure; I don't believe there is a subject on
which we think or feel alike. But I rather think we shall get on, for
there is such a thing, you know, as being too different to quarrel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I never quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! Sometimes it's a duty--or at least it's a pleasure. Oh, I have
had two or three delicious quarrels in my day!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>and M. de Bellegarde's
handsome smile assumed, at the memory of these incidents, an almost
voluptuous intensity.

<p/>With the preamble embodied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) share of the foregoing fragment of
dialogue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paid our hero a long visit; as the two men sat with their
heels on Newman's glowing hearth, they heard the small hours of the
morning striking larger from a far-off belfry. Valentin de Bellegarde
was, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own confession, at all times a great chatterer, and on this
occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was evidently in a particularly loquacious mood. It was a
tradition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) race that people of its blood always conferred a favor
by their smiles, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) enthusiasms were as rare as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) civility was
constant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had a double reason for not suspecting that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) friendship
could ever be importunate. Moreover, the flower of an ancient stem as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was, tradition -LRB-since I have used the word-RRB- had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) temperament
nothing of disagreeable rigidity. It was muffled in sociability and
urbanity, as an old dowager in her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) laces and strings of pearls. Valentin
was what is called in France a _gentilhomme_, of the purest source, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) rule of life, so far as it was definite, was to play the part of a
_gentilhomme_. This, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), was enough to occupy comfortably
a young man of ordinary good parts. But all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was by
instinct and not by theory, and the amiability of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character was so
great that certain of the aristocratic virtues, which in some aspects
seem rather brittle and trenchant, acquired in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) application of them
an extreme geniality. In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) younger years he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been suspected of low
tastes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother had greatly feared he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make a slip in the
mud of the highway and bespatter the family shield. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been treated,
therefore, to more than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share of schooling and drilling, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
instructors had not succeeded in mounting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upon stilts. They could
not spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) safe spontaneity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained the least cautious and
the most lucky of young nobles. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been tied with so short a rope in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had now a mortal grudge against family discipline.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been known to say, within the limits of the family, that,
light-headed as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, the honor of the name was safer in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands
than in those of some of its other members, and that if a day ever came
to try it, they should see. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talk was an odd mixture of almost boyish
garrulity and of the reserve and discretion of the man of the world,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to Newman, as afterwards young members of the Latin races
often seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), now amusingly juvenile and now appallingly mature.
In America, Newman reflected, lads of twenty-five and thirty have old
heads and young hearts, or at least young morals; here they have young
heads and very aged hearts, morals the most grizzled and wrinkled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I envy you is your liberty,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>observed M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``your wide
range, your freedom to come and go, your not having a lot of people, who
take themselves awfully seriously, expecting something of you. I live,''
 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) added with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``beneath the eyes of my admirable mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your own fault; what is to hinder your ranging?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a delightful simplicity in that remark! Everything is to
hinder me. To begin with, I have not a penny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had not a penny when I began to range.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, but your poverty was your capital. Being an American, it was
impossible you should remain what you were born, and being born poor--do
I understand it?--it was therefore inevitable that you should become
rich. You were in a position that makes one's mouth water; you looked
round you and saw a world full of things you had only to step up to and
take hold of. When I was twenty, I looked around me and saw a world with
everything ticketed `Hands off!' and the deuce of it was that the ticket
seemed meant only for me. I couldn't go into business, I couldn't make
money, because I was a Bellegarde. I couldn't go into politics, because
I was a Bellegarde--the Bellegardes don't recognize the Bonapartes. I
couldn't go into literature, because I was a dunce. I couldn't marry a
rich girl, because no Bellegarde had ever married a _roturière_, and it
was not proper that I should begin. We shall have to come to it, yet.
Marriageable heiresses, _de notre bord_, are not to be had for nothing;
it must be name for name, and fortune for fortune. The only thing I
could do was to go and fight for the Pope. That I did, punctiliously,
and received an apostolic flesh-wound at Castlefidardo. It did neither
the Holy Father nor me any good, that I could see. Rome was doubtless a
very amusing place in the days of Caligula, but it has sadly fallen off
since. I passed three years in the Castle of St. Angelo, and then came
back to secular life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you have no profession--you do nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do nothing! I am supposed to amuse myself, and, to tell the truth, I
have amused myself. One can, if one knows how. But you can't keep it up
forever. I am good for another five years, perhaps, but I foresee that
after that I shall lose my appetite. Then what shall I do? I think I
shall turn monk. Seriously, I think I shall tie a rope round my waist
and go into a monastery. It was an old custom, and the old customs were
very good. People understood life quite as well as we do. They kept
the pot boiling till it cracked, and then they put it on the shelf
altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very religious?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, in a tone which gave the inquiry
a grotesque effect.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde evidently appreciated the comical element in the
question, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) looked at Newman a moment with extreme soberness. <div class="bookquote">``I am
a very good Catholic. I respect the Church. I adore the blessed Virgin.
I fear the Devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``you are very well fixed. You have got
pleasure in the present and religion in the future; what do you complain
of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a part of one's pleasure to complain. There is something in your
own circumstances that irritates me. You are the first man I have ever
envied. It's singular, but so it is. I have known many men who, besides
any factitious advantages that I may possess, had money and brains into
the bargain; but somehow they have never disturbed my good-humor. But
you have got something that I should have liked to have. It is not
money, it is not even brains--though no doubt yours are excellent. It is
not your six feet of height, though I should have rather liked to be a
couple of inches taller. It's a sort of air you have of being thoroughly
at home in the world. When I was a boy, my father told me that it was
by such an air as that that people recognized a Bellegarde. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) called my
attention to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) didn't advise me to cultivate it; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said that as we
grew up it always came of itself. I supposed it had come to me, because
I think I have always had the feeling. My place in life was made for me,
and it seemed easy to occupy it. But you who, as I understand it,
have made your own place, you who, as you told us the other day, have
manufactured wash-tubs--you strike me, somehow, as a man who stands at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ease, who looks at things from a height. I fancy you going about the
world like a man traveling on a railroad in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owns a large amount
of stock. You make me feel as if I had missed something. What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the proud consciousness of honest toil--of having manufactured a
few wash-tubs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, at once jocose and serious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; I have seen men who had done even more, men who had made not
only wash-tubs, but soap--strong-smelling yellow soap, in great bars;
and they never made me the least uncomfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it's the privilege of being an American citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``That sets a man up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>rejoined M. de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``But I am forced to say that I
have seen a great many American citizens who didn't seem at all set up
or in the least like large stock-holders. I never envied them. I rather
think the thing is an accomplishment of your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``you will make me proud!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shall not. You have nothing to do with pride, or with
humility--that is a part of this easy manner of yours. People are
proud only when they have something to lose, and humble when they have
something to gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what I have to lose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``but I certainly have
something to gain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitor.

<p/>Newman hesitated a while. <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you when I know you better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that will be soon! Then, if I can help you to gain it, I shall
be happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't forget, then, that I am your servant,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de Bellegarde answered;
and shortly afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) departure.

<p/>During the next three weeks Newman saw Bellegarde several times, and
without formally swearing an eternal friendship the two men established
a sort of comradeship. To Newman, Bellegarde was the ideal Frenchman,
the Frenchman of tradition and romance, so far as our hero was concerned
with these mystical influences. Gallant, expansive, amusing, more
pleased himself with the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallant</b></font>) produced than those -LRB-even when
they were well pleased-RRB- for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallant</b></font>) produced it; a master of all the
distinctively social virtues and a votary of all agreeable sensations;
a devotee of something mysterious and sacred to which he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) occasionally
alluded in terms more ecstatic even than those in which he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) spoke of the
last pretty woman, and which was simply the beautiful though somewhat
superannuated image of _honor_; he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) was irresistibly entertaining and
enlivening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devotee</b></font>) formed a character to which Newman was as capable of
doing justice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had once been placed in contact with it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
unlikely, in musing upon the possible mixtures of our human ingredients,
mentally to have foreshadowed it. Bellegarde did not in the least cause
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to modify his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) needful premise that all Frenchmen are of a frothy and
imponderable substance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) simply reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) that light materials may
be beaten up into a most agreeable compound. No two companions could
be more different, but their differences made a capital basis for a
friendship of which the distinctive characteristic was that it was
extremely amusing to each.

<p/>Valentin de Bellegarde lived in the basement of an old house in the Rue
d’Anjou St. Honoré, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) small apartments lay between the court of
the house and an old garden which spread itself behind it--one of those
large, sunless humid gardens into which you look unexpectingly in Paris
from back windows, wondering how among the grudging habitations they
find their space. When Newman returned Bellegarde's visit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hinted
that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)_ lodging was at least as much a laughing matter as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own.
But its oddities were of a different cast from those of our hero's
gilded saloons on the Boulevard Haussmann: the place was low, dusky,
contracted, and crowded with curious bric-à-brac. Bellegarde, penniless
patrician as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was, was an insatiable collector, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) walls were
covered with rusty arms and ancient panels and platters, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) doorways
draped in faded tapestries, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) floors muffled in the skins of beasts.
Here and there was one of those uncomfortable tributes to elegance in
which the upholsterer's art, in France, is so prolific; a curtain recess
with a sheet of looking-glass in which, among the shadows, you could see
nothing; a divan on which, for its festoons and furbelows, you could not
sit; a fireplace draped, flounced, and frilled to the complete exclusion
of fire. The young man's possessions were in picturesque disorder, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) apartment was pervaded by the odor of cigars, mingled with perfumes
more inscrutable. Newman thought it a damp, gloomy place to live in,
and was puzzled by the obstructive and fragmentary character of the
furniture.

<p/>Bellegarde, according to the custom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) country talked very
generously about himself, and unveiled the mysteries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) private
history with an unsparing hand. Inevitably, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had a vast deal to
say about women, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) used frequently to indulge in sentimental and
ironical apostrophes to these authors of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) joys and woes. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, the
women, the women, and the things they have made me do!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) would exclaim
with a lustrous eye. <div class="bookquote">``_C’est égal_, of all the follies and stupidities
I have committed for them I would not have missed one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>On this subject
Newman maintained an habitual reserve; to expatiate largely upon it had
always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a proceeding vaguely analogous to the cooing of
pigeons and the chattering of monkeys, and even inconsistent with a
fully developed human character. But Bellegarde's confidences greatly
amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), and rarely displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), for the generous young Frenchman
was not a cynic. <div class="bookquote">``I really think,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had once said, <div class="bookquote">``that I am not more
depraved than most of my contemporaries. They are tolerably depraved,
my contemporaries!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said wonderfully pretty things about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) female
friends, and, numerous and various as they had been, declared that on
the whole there was more good in them than harm. <div class="bookquote">``But you are not
to take that as advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``As an authority I am very
untrustworthy. I'm prejudiced in their favor; I'm an _idealist!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) impartial smile, and was glad, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own
sake, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had fine feelings; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mentally repudiated the idea
of a Frenchman having discovered any merit in the amiable sex which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
himself did not suspect. M. de Bellegarde, however, did not confine his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
conversation to the autobiographical channel; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) questioned our hero
largely as to the events of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own life, and Newman told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) some
better stories than any that Bellegarde carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) budget. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
narrated his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) career, in fact, from the beginning, through all its
variations, and whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) companion's credulity, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) habits of
gentility, appeared to protest, it amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to heighten the color
of the episode. Newman had sat with Western humorists in knots, round
cast-iron stoves, and seen <div class="bookquote">``tall''  (<font color='red'><b>humorists stoves</b></font>)</div>stories grow taller without toppling
over, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own imagination had learned the trick of piling up
consistent wonders. Bellegarde's regular attitude at last became that
of laughing self-defense; to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) reputation as an all-knowing
Frenchman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) doubted of everything, wholesale. The result of this was
that Newman found it impossible to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of certain time-honored
verities.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the details don't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``You have
evidently had some surprising adventures; you have seen some strange
sides of life, you have revolved to and fro over a whole continent as
I walked up and down the Boulevard. You are a man of the world with a
vengeance! You have spent some deadly dull hours, and you have done some
extremely disagreeable things: you have shoveled sand, as a boy, for
supper, and you have eaten roast dog in a gold-diggers' camp. You have
stood casting up figures for ten hours at a time, and you have sat
through Methodist sermons for the sake of looking at a pretty girl in
another pew. All that is rather stiff, as we say. But at any rate you
have done something and you are something; you have used your will
and you have made your fortune. You have not stupified yourself
with debauchery and you have not mortgaged your fortune to social
conveniences. You take things easily, and you have fewer prejudices even
than I, who pretend to have none, but who in reality have three or
four. Happy man, you are strong and you are free. But what the deuce,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>demanded the young man in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``do you propose to do with such
advantages? Really to use them you need a better world than this. There
is nothing worth your while here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think there is something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>murmured Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you some other time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>In this way our hero delayed from day to day broaching a subject
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had very much at heart. Meanwhile, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was growing
practically familiar with it; in other words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had called again, three
times, on Madame de Cintré. On only two of these occasions had he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at home, and on each of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had other visitors. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitors
were numerous and extremely loquacious, and they exacted much of their
hostess's attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found time, however, to bestow a little of it
on Newman, in an occasional vague smile, the very vagueness of which
pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as it did to fill it out mentally, both at the
time and afterwards, with such meanings as most pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat by
without speaking, looking at the entrances and exits, the greetings and
chatterings, of Madame de Cintré's visitors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were at
the play, and as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own speaking would be an interruption; sometimes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a book, to follow the dialogue; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) half expected to see
a woman in a white cap and pink ribbons come and offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) one for two
francs. Some of the ladies looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) very hard--or very soft, as you
please; others seemed profoundly unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presence. The men
looked only at Madame de Cintré. This was inevitable; for whether one
called her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beautiful or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entirely occupied and filled one's
vision, just as an agreeable sound fills one's ear. Newman had but
twenty distinct words with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) carried away an impression to
which solemn promises could not have given a higher value. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was part
of the play that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was seeing acted, quite as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companions;
but how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) filled the stage and how much better she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did it! Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
rose or seated herself; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departing friends to
the door and lifted up the heavy curtain as they passed out, and stood
an instant looking after them and giving them the last nod; or whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) leaned back in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chair with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms crossed and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes resting,
listening and smiling; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave Newman the feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should like
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), moving slowly to and fro along the whole
scale of expressive hospitality. If it might be _to_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), it would be
well; if it might be _for_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), it would be still better! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so
tall and yet so light, so active and yet so still, so elegant and yet so
simple, so frank and yet so mysterious! It was the mystery--it was what
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was off the stage, as it were--that interested Newman most of
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could not have told you what warrant he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had for talking about
mysteries; if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) habit to express himself in poetic figures
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might have said that in observing Madame de Cintré he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to see
the vague circle which sometimes accompanies the partly-filled disk of
the moon. It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was reserved; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
as frank as flowing water. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had qualities which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
herself did not suspect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had abstained for several reasons from saying some of these things
to Bellegarde. One reason was that before proceeding to any act he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was
always circumspect, conjectural, contemplative; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had little eagerness,
as became a man who felt that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) really began to move he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
walked with long steps. And then, it simply pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) not to speak--it
occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), it excited him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). But one day Bellegarde had been dining
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), at a restaurant, and they had sat long over their dinner. On
rising from it, Bellegarde proposed that, to help them through the
rest of the evening, they should go and see Madame Dandelard. Madame
Dandelard was a little Italian lady who had married a Frenchman who
proved to be a rake and a brute and the torment of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband
had spent all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money, and then, lacking the means of obtaining more
expensive pleasures, had taken, in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) duller hours, to beating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a blue spot somewhere, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed to several persons,
including Bellegarde. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had obtained a separation from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband,
collected the scraps of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fortune -LRB-they were very meagre-RRB- and come to
live in Paris, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was staying at a _hôtel garni_. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was always
looking for an apartment, and visiting, inquiringly, those of other
people. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very pretty, very childlike, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made very
extraordinary remarks. Bellegarde had made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acquaintance, and the
source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own declaration, a
curiosity as to what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is pretty,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it seems to me she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can go only one way.
It's a pity, but it can't be helped. I will give her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) six months. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has
nothing to fear from me, but I am watching the process. I am curious to
see just how things will go. Yes, I know what you are going to say: this
horrible Paris hardens one's heart. But it quickens one's wits, and it
ends by teaching one a refinement of observation! To see this little
woman's little drama play itself out, now, is, for me, an intellectual
pleasure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is going to throw herself away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman had said, <div class="bookquote">``you ought to
stop her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? How stop her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) some good advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven deliver us both! Imagine the situation! Go
and advise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>It was after this that Newman had gone with Bellegarde to see Madame
Dandelard. When they came away, Bellegarde reproached his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) companion.
<div class="bookquote">``Where was your famous advice?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't hear a word of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I give it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are as bad as I!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, because I don't take an `intellectual pleasure' in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prospective
adventures. I don't in the least want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) going down hill. I had
rather look the other way. But why,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked, in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``don't you
get your sister to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde stared. <div class="bookquote">``Go and see Madame Dandelard--my sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to very good purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head with sudden gravity. <div class="bookquote">``My sister can't see that
sort of person. Madame Dandelard is nothing at all; they would never
meet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that your sister might see whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
pleased.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) privately resolved that after he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little
better he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would ask Madame de Cintré to go and talk to the foolish
little Italian lady.

<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) dinner with Bellegarde, on the occasion I have mentioned,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) demurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) companion's proposal that they should go again and
listen to Madame Dandelard describe her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sorrows and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bruises.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something better in mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``come home with me and
finish the evening before my fire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde always welcomed the prospect of a long stretch of
conversation, and before long the two men sat watching the great blaze
which scattered its scintillations over the high adornments of Newman's
ball-room.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me something about your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman began abruptly.

<p/>Bellegarde turned and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) a quick look. <div class="bookquote">``Now that I think of it,
you have never yet asked me a question about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is because you don't trust me, you are very right,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said
Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I can't talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rationally. I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as you can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>rejoined Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Let yourself go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we are very good friends; we are such a brother and sister as
have not been seen since Orestes and Electra. You have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>); you
know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) is: tall, thin, light, imposing, and gentle, half a
_grande dame_ and half an angel; a mixture of pride and humility, of the
eagle and the dove. She (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) looks like a statue which had failed as stone,
resigned itself to its grave defects, and come to life as flesh and
blood, to wear white capes and long trains. All I can say is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>)
really possesses every merit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) glance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) smile, the
tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Electra</b></font>) voice, lead you to expect; it is saying a great deal. As a
general thing, when a woman seems very charming, I should say `Beware!'
But in proportion as Claire seems charming you may fold your arms and
let yourself float with the current; you are safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is so good!
I have never seen a woman half so perfect or so complete. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has
everything; that is all I can say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>). There!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Bellegarde
concluded; <div class="bookquote">``I told you I should rhapsodize.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was silent a while, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were turning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion's
words. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is very good, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) repeated at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Divinely good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kind, charitable, gentle, generous?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Generosity itself; kindness double-distilled!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) clever?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is the most intelligent woman I know. Try her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>), some day, with
something difficult, and you will see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) fond of admiration?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Parbleu!_''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``what woman is not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, when they are too fond of admiration they commit all kinds of
follies to get it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too fond!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Bellegarde exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid I
should say anything so idiotic. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not _too_ anything! If I were
to say she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ugly, I should not mean she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too ugly. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is fond
of pleasing, and if you are pleased she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is grateful. If you are not
pleased, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lets it pass and thinks the worst neither of you nor of
herself. I imagine, though, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hopes the saints in heaven are, for I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is incapable of trying to please by any means of which they
would disapprove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grave or gay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is both; not alternately, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is always the same. There is
gravity in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gaiety, and gaiety in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gravity. But there is no reason
why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be particularly gay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unhappy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't say that, for unhappiness is according as one takes things, and
Claire takes them according to some receipt communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) by the
Blessed Virgin in a vision. To be unhappy is to be disagreeable, which,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>), is out of the question. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) circumstances
so as to be happy in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is a philosopher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is simply a very nice woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) circumstances, at any rate, have been disagreeable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde hesitated a moment--a thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) very rarely did. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear
fellow, if I go into the history of my family I shall give you more than
you bargain for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, on the contrary, I bargain for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall have to appoint a special séance, then, beginning early.
Suffice it for the present that Claire has not slept on roses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)
made at eighteen a marriage that was expected to be brilliant, but that
turned out like a lamp that goes out; all smoke and bad smell. M. de
Cintré was sixty years old, and an odious old gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) lived,
however, but a short time, and after his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) death his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) family pounced upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) money, brought a lawsuit against his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) widow, and pushed things very
hard. Their case was a good one, for M. de Cintré, who had been trustee
for some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) relatives, appeared to have been guilty of some very
irregular practices. In the course of the suit some revelations were
made as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) private history which my sister found so displeasing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ceased to defend herself and washed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands of the property. This
required some pluck, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was between two fires, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband's family
opposing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own family forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). My mother and my brother
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to cleave to what they regarded as her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) rights. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
resisted firmly, and at last bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) freedom--obtained my mother's
assent to dropping the suit at the price of a promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was the promise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To do anything else, for the next ten years, that was asked of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--anything, that is, but marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband very much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one knows how much!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The marriage had been made in your horrible French way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
continued, <div class="bookquote">``made by the two families, without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) having any voice?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a chapter for a novel. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw M. de Cintré for the first time a
month before the wedding, after everything, to the minutest detail, had
been arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned white when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and white she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
remained till her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wedding-day. The evening before the ceremony she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
swooned away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spent the whole night in sobs. My mother sat
holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) two hands, and my brother walked up and down the room. I
declared it was revolting and told my sister publicly that if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would
refuse, downright, I would stand by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I was told to go about my
business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) became Comtesse de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``must be a very nice young
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very nice, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not young. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is upward of fifty, fifteen
years my senior. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been a father to my sister and me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a
very remarkable man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has the best manners in France. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is extremely
clever; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very learned. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is writing a history of The
Princesses of France Who Never Married.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>This was said by Bellegarde
with extreme gravity, looking straight at Newman, and with an eye that
betokened no mental reservation; or that, at least, almost betokened
none.

<p/>Newman perhaps discovered there what little there was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently
said, <div class="bookquote">``You don't love your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, ceremoniously; <div class="bookquote">``well-bred people
always love their brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till you know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>rejoined Bellegarde, and this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is your mother also very remarkable?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, now with intense gravity, <div class="bookquote">``I have
the highest admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a very extraordinary woman. You cannot
approach her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) without perceiving it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is the daughter, I believe, of an English nobleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of the Earl of St. Dunstan's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the Earl of St. Dunstan's a very old family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So-so; the sixteenth century. It is on my father's side that we go
back--back, back, back. The family antiquaries themselves lose breath.
At last they stop, panting and fanning themselves, somewhere in the
ninth century, under Charlemagne. That is where we begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no mistake about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I hope not. We have been mistaken at least for several
centuries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have always married into old families?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a rule; though in so long a stretch of time there have been some
exceptions. Three or four Bellegardes, in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, took wives out of the _bourgeoisie_--married lawyers'
daughters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lawyer's daughter; that's very bad, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Horrible! one of us, in the Middle Ages, did better: he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) married a
beggar-maid, like King Cophetua. That was really better; it was like
marrying a bird or a monkey; one didn't have to think about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family
at all. Our women have always done well; they have never even gone into
the _petite noblesse_. There is, I believe, not a case on record of a
misalliance among the women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman turned this over for a while, and, then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You
offered, the first time you came to see me to render me any service you
could. I told you that some time I would mention something you might do.
Do you remember?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember? I have been counting the hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; here's your chance. Do what you can to make your sister
think well of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde stared, with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Why, I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thinks as well of
you as possible, already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An opinion founded on seeing me three or four times? That is putting me
off with very little. I want something more. I have been thinking of it
a good deal, and at last I have decided to tell you. I should like very
much to marry Madame de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde had been looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) with quickened expectancy, and with
the smile with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had greeted Newman's allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) promised
request. At this last announcement he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued to gaze; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
smile went through two or three curious phases. It felt, apparently, a
momentary impulse to broaden; but this it immediately checked. Then it
remained for some instants taking counsel with itself, at the end of
which it decreed a retreat. It slowly effaced itself and left a look of
seriousness modified by the desire not to be rude. Extreme surprise had
come into the Count Valentin's face; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had reflected that it would
be uncivil to leave it there. And yet, what the deuce was he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) to do with
it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) got up, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) agitation, and stood before the chimney-piece,
still looking at Newman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was a longer time thinking what to say than
one would have expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can't render me the service I ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``say it out!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me hear it again, distinctly,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``It's very
important, you know. I shall plead your cause with my sister, because
you want--you want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? That's it, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't say plead my cause, exactly; I shall try and do that
myself. But say a good word for me, now and then--let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) know that you
think well of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>At this, Bellegarde gave a little light laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I want chiefly, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman went on, <div class="bookquote">``is just to let you
know what I have in mind. I suppose that is what you expect, isn't it? I
want to do what is customary over here. If there is anything particular
to be done, let me know and I will do it. I wouldn't for the world
approach Madame de Cintré without all the proper forms. If I ought to
go and tell your mother, why I will go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I will go and tell
your brother, even. I will go and tell anyone you please. As I don't
know anyone else, I begin by telling you. But that, if it is a social
obligation, is a pleasure as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I see--I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, lightly stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) chin. <div class="bookquote">``You
have a very right feeling about it, but I'm glad you have begun with
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) paused, hesitated, and then turned away and walked slowly
the length of the room. Newman got up and stood leaning against the
mantel-shelf, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pockets, watching Bellegarde's
promenade. The young Frenchman came back and stopped in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``I give it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I will not pretend I am not surprised. I
am--hugely! _Ouf!_ It's a relief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That sort of news is always a surprise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``No matter what
you have done, people are never prepared. But if you are so surprised, I
hope at least you are pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I am going to be tremendously frank. I don't
know whether I am pleased or horrified.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are pleased, I shall be glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall
be--encouraged. If you are horrified, I shall be sorry, but I shall not
be discouraged. You must make the best of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is quite right--that is your only possible attitude. You are
perfectly serious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I a Frenchman, that I should not be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But why is it,
by the bye, that you should be horrified?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand to the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hair
quickly up and down, thrusting out the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) tongue as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) did so.
<div class="bookquote">``Why, you are not noble, for instance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil I am not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde a little more seriously, <div class="bookquote">``I did not know you had a
title.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A title? What do you mean by a title?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman. <div class="bookquote">``A count, a duke,
a marquis? I don't know anything about that, I don't know who is and who
is not. But I say I am noble. I don't exactly know what you mean by it,
but it's a fine word and a fine idea; I put in a claim to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what have you to show, my dear fellow, what proofs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything you please! But you don't suppose I am going to undertake to
prove that I am noble. It is for you to prove the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's easily done. You have manufactured wash-tubs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stared a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Therefore I am not noble? I don't see it. Tell
me something I have _not_ done--something I cannot do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot marry a woman like Madame de Cintré for the asking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman slowly, <div class="bookquote">``that I am not good enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brutally speaking--yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde had hesitated a moment, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hesitated Newman's
attentive glance had grown somewhat eager. In answer to these last words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for a moment said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply blushed a little. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) raised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes to the ceiling and stood looking at one of the rosy cherubs
that was painted upon it. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I don't expect to marry any
woman for the asking,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``I expect first to make myself
acceptable to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must like me, to begin with. But that I am not
good enough to make a trial is rather a surprise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde wore a look of mingled perplexity, sympathy, and amusement.
<div class="bookquote">``You should not hesitate, then, to go up to-morrow and ask a duchess to
marry you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) would suit me. But I am very fastidious; she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) might
not at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde's amusement began to prevail. <div class="bookquote">``And you should be surprised if
she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) refused you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``It sounds conceited to say yes, but
nevertheless I think I should. For I should make a very handsome offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would it be?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wishes. If I get hold of a woman that comes up to my
standard, I shall think nothing too good for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). I have been a long
time looking, and I find such women are rare. To combine the qualities I
require seems to be difficult, but when the difficulty is vanquished
it deserves a reward. My wife shall have a good position, and I'm not
afraid to say that I shall be a good husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And these qualities that you require--what are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Goodness, beauty, intelligence, a fine education, personal
elegance--everything, in a word, that makes a splendid woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And noble birth, evidently,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, throw that in, by all means, if it's there. The more the better!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And my sister seems to you to have all these things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is exactly what I have been looking for. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is my dream realized.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a very good husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I wanted you to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) companion's arm a moment, looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head on one side, from head to foot, and then, with a loud
laugh, and shaking the other hand in the air, turned away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) walked
again the length of the room, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) came back and stationed
himself in front of Newman. <div class="bookquote">``All this is very interesting--it is very
curious. In what I said just now I was speaking, not for myself, but
for my tradition, my superstitions. For myself, really, your proposal
tickles me. It startled me at first, but the more I think of it the
more I see in it. It's no use attempting to explain anything; you won't
understand me. After all, I don't see why you need; it's no great loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if there is anything more to explain, try it! I want to proceed
with my eyes open. I will do my best to understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``it's disagreeable to me; I give it up. I liked
you the first time I saw you, and I will abide by that. It would be
quite odious for me to come talking to you as if I could patronize you.
I have told you before that I envy you; _vous m'imposez_, as we say. I
didn't know you much until within five minutes. So we will let things
go, and I will say nothing to you that, if our positions were reversed,
you would not say to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>I do not know whether in renouncing the mysterious opportunity to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) alluded, Bellegarde felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was doing something very generous.
If so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was not rewarded; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) generosity was not appreciated. Newman
quite failed to recognize the young Frenchman's power to wound his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
feelings, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had now no sense of escaping or coming off easily.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not thank his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion even with a glance. <div class="bookquote">``My eyes are open,
though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so far as that you have practically told me that your
family and your friends will turn up their noses at me. I have never
thought much about the reasons that make it proper for people to turn up
their noses, and so I can only decide the question off-hand. Looking at
it in that way I can't see anything in it. I simply think, if you want
to know, that I'm as good as the best. Who the best are, I don't pretend
to say. I have never thought much about that either. To tell the
truth, I have always had rather a good opinion of myself; a man who is
successful can't help it. But I will admit that I was conceited. What
I don't say yes to is that I don't stand high--as high as anyone else.
This is a line of speculation I should not have chosen, but you must
remember you began it yourself. I should never have dreamed that I was
on the defensive, or that I had to justify myself; but if your people
will have it so, I will do my best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you offered, a while ago, to make your court as we say, to my
mother and my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I want to be polite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>rejoined Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``this will go far, it will be very
entertaining. Excuse my speaking of it in that cold-blooded fashion, but
the matter must, of necessity, be for me something of a spectacle. It's
positively exciting. But apart from that I sympathize with you, and I
shall be actor, so far as I can, as well as spectator. You are a capital
fellow; I believe in you and I back you. The simple fact that you
appreciate my sister will serve as the proof I was asking for. All men
are equal--especially men of taste!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman presently, <div class="bookquote">``that Madame de Cintré is
determined not to marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my impression. But that is not against you; it's for you to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) change her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it will be hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think it will be easy. In a general way I don't see why a
widow should ever marry again. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) has gained the benefits of
matrimony--freedom and consideration--and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) has got rid of the
drawbacks. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) head into the noose again? Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) usual
motive is ambition: if a man can offer her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) a great position, make her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) a
princess or an ambassadress she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) may think the compensation sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And--in that way--is Madame de Cintré ambitious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, with a profound shrug. <div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to
say all that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is or all that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is not. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) might be touched
by the prospect of becoming the wife of a great man. But in a certain
way, I believe, whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) does will be the _improbable_. Don't be too
confident, but don't absolutely doubt. Your best chance for success will
be precisely in being, to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mind, unusual, unexpected, original. Don't
try to be anyone else; be simply yourself, out and out. Something or
other can't fail to come of it; I am very curious to see what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for your advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``And,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added
with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad, for your sake, I am going to be so amusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be more than amusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``it will be inspiring.
I look at it from my point of view, and you from yours. After all,
anything for a change! And only yesterday I was yawning so as to
dislocate my jaw, and declaring that there was nothing new under the
sun! If it isn't new to see you come into the family as a suitor, I am
very much mistaken. Let me say that, my dear fellow; I won't call it
anything else, bad or good; I will simply call it _new_.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>And overcome
with a sense of the novelty thus foreshadowed, Valentin de Bellegarde
threw himself into a deep armchair before the fire, and, with a fixed,
intense smile, seemed to read a vision of it in the flame of the logs.
After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) looked up. <div class="bookquote">``Go ahead, my boy; you have my good wishes,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it is really a pity you don't understand me, that you
don't know just what I am doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``don't do anything wrong. Leave me to
myself, rather, or defy me, out and out. I wouldn't lay any load on your
conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde sprang up again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was evidently excited; there was a warmer
spark even than usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``You never will understand--you never
will know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and if you succeed, and I turn out to have helped
you, you will never be grateful, not as I shall deserve you should be.
You will be an excellent fellow always, but you will not be grateful.
But it doesn't matter, for I shall get my own fun out of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
broke into an extravagant laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You look puzzled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``you look
almost frightened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It _is_ a pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't understand you. I shall
lose some very good jokes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you, you remember, that we were very strange people,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Bellegarde
went on. <div class="bookquote">``I give you warning again. We are! My mother is strange, my
brother is strange, and I verily believe that I am stranger than either.
You will even find my sister a little strange. Old trees have crooked
branches, old houses have queer cracks, old races have odd secrets.
Remember that we are eight hundred years old!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that's the sort of thing I came to Europe
for. You come into my programme.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Touchez-là_, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``It's a
bargain: I accept you; I espouse your cause. It's because I like you, in
a great measure; but that is not the only reason!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) stood holding
Newman's hand and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) askance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the other one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am in the Opposition. I dislike someone else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) unmodulated voice.

<p/>Bellegarde laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) fingers upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) lips with a whispered _hush!_ <div class="bookquote">``Old
races have strange secrets!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Put yourself into motion, come
and see my sister, and be assured of my sympathy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And on this he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) leave.

<p/>Newman dropped into a chair before his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fire, and sat a long time staring
into the blaze.



<p/>CHAPTER IX

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to see Madame de Cintré the next day, and was informed by the
servant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) passed as usual up the large, cold
staircase and through a spacious vestibule above, where the walls seemed
all composed of small door panels, touched with long-faded gilding;
whence he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was ushered into the sitting-room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had already been
received. It was empty, and the servant told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) that Madame la Comtesse
would presently appear. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had time, while he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) waited, to wonder whether
Bellegarde had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sister since the evening before, and whether
in this case he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of their talk. In this case Madame
de Cintré's receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was an encouragement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) felt a certain
trepidation as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) reflected that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might come in with the knowledge
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) supreme admiration and of the project he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had built upon it in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
eyes; but the feeling was not disagreeable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face could wear no
look that would make it less beautiful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was sure beforehand that
however she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might take the proposal he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had in reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not
take it in scorn or in irony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had a feeling that if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could only
read the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) heart and measure the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) good will
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be entirely kind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came in at last, after so long an interval that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) wondered whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been hesitating. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) smiled with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual frankness, and held
out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) straight with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) soft and luminous
eyes, and said, without a tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was glad to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) and that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) found in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had found
before--that faint perfume of a personal shyness worn away by contact
with the world, but the more perceptible the more closely you approached
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). This lingering diffidence seemed to give a peculiar value to
what was definite and assured in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) manner; it made it seem like an
accomplishment, a beautiful talent, something that one might compare
to an exquisite touch in a pianist. It was, in fact, Madame de Cintré's
<div class="bookquote">``authority,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>as they say of artists, that especially impressed and
fascinated Newman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) always came back to the feeling that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
should complete himself by taking a wife, that was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should
like his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife to interpret him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to the world. The only trouble, indeed,
was that when the instrument was so perfect it seemed to interpose too
much between you and the genius that used it. Madame de Cintré gave
Newman the sense of an elaborate education, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having passed through
mysterious ceremonies and processes of culture in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) youth, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
having been fashioned and made flexible to certain exalted social needs.
All this, as I have affirmed, made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seem rare and precious--a very
expensive article, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have said, and one which a man with an
ambition to have everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of the best would find it highly
agreeable to possess. But looking at the matter with an eye to private
felicity, Newman wondered where, in so exquisite a compound, nature and
art showed their dividing line. Where did the special intention separate
from the habit of good manners? Where did urbanity end and sincerity
begin? Newman asked himself these questions even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood ready to
accept the admired object in all its complexity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could
do so in profound security, and examine its mechanism afterwards, at
leisure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to find you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You know I have never had
such good luck before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have seemed before very well contented with your luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``You have sat and watched my visitors with an air of
quiet amusement. What have you thought of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have thought the ladies were very elegant and very graceful, and
wonderfully quick at repartee. But what I have chiefly thought has
been that they only helped me to admire you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>This was not gallantry on
Newman's part--an art in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was quite unversed. It was simply the
instinct of the practical man, who had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted,
and was now beginning to take active steps to obtain it.

<p/>Madame de Cintré started slightly, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyebrows; she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
evidently not expected so fervid a compliment. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, in that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``your finding me alone is not good luck for me. I
hope someone will come in quickly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I have something particular to say to you.
Have you seen your brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) an hour ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had seen me last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tell you what we had talked about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré hesitated a moment. As Newman asked these questions
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had grown a little pale, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) regarded what was coming as
necessary, but not as agreeable. <div class="bookquote">``Did you give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) a message to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not exactly a message--I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to render me a service.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The service was to sing your praises, was it not?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) accompanied
this question with a little smile, as if to make it easier to herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that is what it really amounts to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sing my
praises?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke very well of you. But when I know that it was by your special
request, of course I must take his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eulogy with a grain of salt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that makes no difference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Your brother would not
have spoken well of me unless he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) believed what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was saying. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is too
honest for that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very deep?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``Are you trying to please me
by praising my brother? I confess it is a good way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me, any way that succeeds will be good. I will praise your brother
all day, if that will help me. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a noble little fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has made
me feel, in promising to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can to help me, that I can depend
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't make too much of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can help you
very little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I must work my way myself. I know that very well; I only want
a chance to. In consenting to see me, after what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) told you, you almost
seem to be giving me a chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am seeing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, slowly and gravely, <div class="bookquote">``because I
promised my brother I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blessings on your brother's head!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``What I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) last
evening was this: that I admired you more than any woman I had ever
seen, and that I should like immensely to make you my wife.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) uttered
these words with great directness and firmness, and without any sense of
confusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had completely mastered it,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) seemed to look down on Madame de Cintré, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gathered
elegance, from the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) bracing good conscience. It is probable
that this particular tone and manner were the very best he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) could have
hit upon. Yet the light, just visibly forced smile with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
companion had listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) died away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lips parted and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face as solemn as a tragic mask. There was
evidently something very painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the scene to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was
subjecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) impatience of it found no angry voice.
Newman wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was hurting her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could not imagine why the
liberal devotion he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) meant to express should be disagreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up
and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), leaning one hand on the chimney-piece. <div class="bookquote">``I know I
have seen you very little to say this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so little that it may
make what I say seem disrespectful. That is my misfortune! I could have
said it the first time I saw you. Really, I had seen you before; I had
seen you in imagination; you seemed almost an old friend. So what I say
is not mere gallantry and compliments and nonsense--I can't talk that
way, I don't know how, and I wouldn't, to you, if I could. It's as
serious as such words can be. I feel as if I knew you and knew what a
beautiful, admirable woman you are. I shall know better, perhaps, some
day, but I have a general notion now. You are just the woman I have
been looking for, except that you are far more perfect. I won't make any
protestations and vows, but you can trust me. It is very soon, I know,
to say all this; it is almost offensive. But why not gain time if one
can? And if you want time to reflect--of course you do--the sooner you
begin, the better for me. I don't know what you think of me; but there
is no great mystery about me; you see what I am. Your brother told me
that my antecedents and occupations were against me; that your family
stands, somehow, on a higher level than I do. That is an idea which of
course I don't understand and don't accept. But you don't care anything
about that. I can assure you that I am a very solid fellow, and that if
I give my mind to it I can arrange things so that in a very few years I
shall not need to waste time in explaining who I am and what I am. You
will decide for yourself whether you like me or not. What there is
you see before you. I honestly believe I have no hidden vices or nasty
tricks. I am kind, kind, kind! Everything that a man can give a woman I
will give you. I have a large fortune, a very large fortune; some day,
if you will allow me, I will go into details. If you want brilliancy,
everything in the way of brilliancy that money can give you, you shall
have. And as regards anything you may give up, don't take for granted
too much that its place cannot be filled. Leave that to me; I'll take
care of you; I shall know what you need. Energy and ingenuity can
arrange everything. I'm a strong man! There, I have said what I had
on my heart! It was better to get it off. I am very sorry if it's
disagreeable to you; but think how much better it is that things should
be clear. Don't answer me now, if you don't wish it. Think about it,
think about it as slowly as you please. Of course I haven't said, I
can't say, half I mean, especially about my admiration for you. But take
a favorable view of me; it will only be just.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>During this speech, the longest that Newman had ever made, Madame de
Cintré kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gaze fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>), and it expanded at the last into a
sort of fascinated stare. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) ceased speaking she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes
and sat for some moments looking down and straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
slowly rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feet, and a pair of exceptionally keen eyes would
have perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was trembling a little in the movement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
still looked extremely serious. <div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you for
your offer,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It seems very strange, but I am glad you
spoke without waiting any longer. It is better the subject should be
dismissed. I appreciate all you say; you do me great honor. But I have
decided not to marry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, in a tone absolutely _naïf_ from
its pleading and caressing cadence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had turned away, and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
stop a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Think better of that. You are
too young, too beautiful, too much made to be happy and to make others
happy. If you are afraid of losing your freedom, I can assure you that
this freedom here, this life you now lead, is a dreary bondage to what
I will offer you. You shall do things that I don't think you have ever
thought of. I will take you anywhere in the wide world that you propose.
Are you unhappy? You give me a feeling that you _are_ unhappy. You have
no right to be, or to be made so. Let me come in and put an end to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré stood there a moment longer, looking away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).
If she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was touched by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spoke, the thing was conceivable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
voice, always very mild and interrogative, gradually became as soft
and as tenderly argumentative as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been talking to a much-loved
child. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently turned round again, but
this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spoke in a quietness in which
there was a visible trace of effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are a great many reasons why I should not marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``more
than I can explain to you. As for my happiness, I am very happy. Your
offer seems strange to me, for more reasons also than I can say. Of
course you have a perfect right to make it. But I cannot accept it--it
is impossible. Please never speak of this matter again. If you cannot
promise me this, I must ask you not to come back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is it impossible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman demanded. <div class="bookquote">``You may think it is, at first,
without its really being so. I didn't expect you to be pleased at first,
but I do believe that if you will think of it a good while, you may be
satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``Think how little I know
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little, of course, and therefore I don't ask for your ultimatum on
the spot. I only ask you not to say no, and to let me hope. I will wait
as long as you desire. Meanwhile you can see more of me and know me
better, look at me as a possible husband--as a candidate--and make up
your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Something was going on, rapidly, in Madame de Cintré's thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was weighing a question there, beneath Newman's eyes, weighing it and
deciding it. <div class="bookquote">``From the moment I don't very respectfully beg you to leave
the house and never return,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I listen to you, I seem to give
you hope. I _have_ listened to you--against my judgment. It is because
you are eloquent. If I had been told this morning that I should
consent to consider you as a possible husband, I should have thought
my informant a little crazy. I _am_ listening to you, you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands out for a moment and let them drop with a gesture in
which there was just the slightest expression of appealing weakness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, as far as saying goes, I have said everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I
believe in you, without restriction, and I think all the good of you
that it is possible to think of a human creature. I firmly believe that
in marrying me you will be _safe_. As I said just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on with
a smile, <div class="bookquote">``I have no bad ways. I can _do_ so much for you. And if you are
afraid that I am not what you have been accustomed to, not refined and
delicate and punctilious, you may easily carry that too far. I _am_
delicate! You shall see!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré walked some distance away, and paused before a great
plant, an azalea, which was flourishing in a porcelain tub before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
window. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) plucked off one of the flowers and, twisting it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
fingers, retraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) steps. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat down in silence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
attitude seemed to be a consent that Newman should say more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you say it is impossible you should marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued.
<div class="bookquote">``The only thing that could make it really impossible would be your being
already married. Is it because you have been unhappy in marriage? That
is all the more reason! Is it because your family exert a pressure upon
you, interfere with you, annoy you? That is still another reason; you
ought to be perfectly free, and marriage will make you so. I don't say
anything against your family--understand that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>added Newman, with
an eagerness which might have made a perspicacious observer smile.
<div class="bookquote">``Whatever way you feel toward them is the right way, and anything that
you should wish me to do to make myself agreeable to them I will do as
well as I know how. Depend upon that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré rose again and came toward the fireplace, near which
Newman was standing. The expression of pain and embarrassment had passed
out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face, and it was illuminated with something which, this time
at least, Newman need not have been perplexed whether to attribute to
habit or to intention, to art or to nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had the air of a woman
who has stepped across the frontier of friendship and, looking around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), finds the region vast. A certain checked and controlled exaltation
seemed mingled with the usual level radiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glance. <div class="bookquote">``I will not
refuse to see you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``because much of what you have said
has given me pleasure. But I will see you only on this condition: that
you say nothing more in the same way for a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For how long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For six months. It must be a solemn promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I promise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, and extended her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) held it a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were going to say something more. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
only looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) departure.

<p/>That evening, on the Boulevard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) met Valentin de Bellegarde. After
they had exchanged greetings, Newman told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen Madame de
Cintré a few hours before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I dined in the Rue de l’Université.''
 (<font color='red'><b>both men</b></font>)</div>And then, for some moments, both men were silent. Newman wished to ask
Bellegarde what visible impression his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visit had made and the Count
Valentin had a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) own. Bellegarde spoke first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's none of my business, but what the deuce did you say to my sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am willing to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that I made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) an offer of
marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Already!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And the young man gave a whistle. ```Time is money!' Is
that what you say in America? And Madame de Cintré?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, with an
interrogative inflection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not accept my offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) couldn't, you know, in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the strangeness of woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Bellegarde. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped,
and held Newman off at arms'-length. <div class="bookquote">``I look at you with respect!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You have achieved what we call a personal success!
Immediately, now, I must present you to my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whenever you please!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.



<p/>CHAPTER X

<p/>Newman continued to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friends the Tristrams with a good deal of
frequency, though if you had listened to Mrs. Tristram's account of the
matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated
for the sake of grander acquaintance. <div class="bookquote">``We were all very well so long
as we had no rivals--we were better than nothing. But now that you have
become the fashion, and have your pick every day of three invitations to
dinner, we are tossed into the corner. I am sure it is very good of you
to come and see us once a month; I wonder you don't send us your cards
in an envelope. When you do, pray have them with black edges; it will be
for the death of my last illusion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>It was in this incisive strain that
Mrs. Tristram moralized over Newman's so-called neglect, which was in
reality a most exemplary constancy. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was joking, but
there was always something ironical in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) jokes, as there was always
something jocular in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know no better proof that I have treated you very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
had said, <div class="bookquote">``than the fact that you make so free with my character.
Familiarity breeds contempt; I have made myself too cheap. If I had a
little proper pride I would stay away a while, and when you asked me to
dinner say I was going to the Princess Borealska's. But I have not any
pride where my pleasure is concerned, and to keep you in the humor to
see me--if you must see me only to call me bad names--I will agree to
anything you choose; I will admit that I am the biggest snob in Paris.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman, in fact, had declined an invitation personally given by the
Princess Borealska, an inquiring Polish lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been
presented, on the ground that on that particular day he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) always dined
at Mrs. Tristram's; and it was only a tenderly perverse theory of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hostess of the Avenue d’Iéna that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was faithless to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) early
friendships. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) needed the theory to explain a certain moral irritation
by which she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) was often visited; though, if this explanation was unsound,
a deeper analyst than I must give the right one. Having launched our
hero upon the current which was bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) so rapidly along, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
appeared but half-pleased at its swiftness. She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had succeeded too well;
she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had played her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) game too cleverly and she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) wished to mix up the cards.
Newman had told her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), in due season, that her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) friend was <div class="bookquote">``satisfactory.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>The epithet was not romantic, but Mrs. Tristram had no difficulty in
perceiving that, in essentials, the feeling which lay beneath it was.
Indeed, the mild, expansive brevity with which it was uttered, and
a certain look, at once appealing and inscrutable, that issued from
Newman's half-closed eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head against the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
chair, seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the most eloquent attestation of a mature sentiment
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had ever encountered. Newman was, according to the French
phrase, only abounding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own sense, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) temperate raptures
exerted a singular effect upon the ardor which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) herself had so freely
manifested a few months before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) now seemed inclined to take a purely
critical view of Madame de Cintré, and wished to have it understood that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did not in the least answer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) being a compendium of all the
virtues. <div class="bookquote">``No woman was ever so good as that woman seems,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Remember what Shakespeare calls Desdemona; `a supersubtle Venetian.'
Madame de Cintré is a supersubtle Parisian. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a charming woman, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has five hundred merits; but you had better keep that in mind.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Was
Mrs. Tristram simply finding out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dear friend
on the other side of the Seine, and that in undertaking to provide
Newman with an ideal wife she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had counted too much on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
disinterestedness? We may be permitted to doubt it. The inconsistent
little lady of the Avenue d’Iéna had an insuperable need of changing
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place, intellectually. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a lively imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
capable, at certain times, of imagining the direct reverse of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
most cherished beliefs, with a vividness more intense than that of
conviction. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got tired of thinking aright; but there was no serious
harm in it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got equally tired of thinking wrong. In the midst of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mysterious perversities she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had admirable flashes of justice. One
of these occurred when Newman related to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had made a formal
proposal to Madame de Cintré. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) repeated in a few words what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
said, and in a great many what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had answered. Mrs. Tristram listened
with extreme interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing to congratulate me upon.
It is not a triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram; <div class="bookquote">``it is a great triumph. It is
a great triumph that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not silence you at the first word, and
request you never to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>observed Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you don't; Heaven forbid you should! When I told you to go on
your own way and do what came into your head, I had no idea you would go
over the ground so fast. I never dreamed you would offer yourself after
five or six morning-calls. As yet, what had you done to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like
you? You had simply sat--not very straight--and stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
does like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That remains to be seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that is proved. What will come of it remains to be seen. That you
should propose to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), without more ado, could never have come
into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. You can form very little idea of what passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
mind as you spoke; if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ever really marries you, the affair will be
characterized by the usual justice of all human beings towards women.
You will think you take generous views of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); but you will never begin
to know through what a strange sea of feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passed before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
accepted you. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood there in front of you the other day, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
plunged into it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said `Why not?' to something which, a few hours
earlier, had been inconceivable. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned about on a thousand gathered
prejudices and traditions as on a pivot, and looked where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never
looked hitherto. When I think of it--when I think of Claire de Cintré
and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) represents, there seems to me something very fine in
it. When I recommended you to try your fortune with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I of course
thought well of you, and in spite of your sins I think so still. But I
confess I don't see quite what you are and what you have done, to make
such a woman do this sort of thing for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is something very fine in it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman with a laugh,
repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took an extreme satisfaction in hearing that
there was something fine in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not the least doubt of it
himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had already begun to value the world's admiration of
Madame de Cintré, as adding to the prospective glory of possession.

<p/>It was immediately after this conversation that Valentin de Bellegarde
came to conduct his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) friend to the Rue de l’Université to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to
the other members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) family. <div class="bookquote">``You are already introduced,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``and you have begun to be talked about. My sister has mentioned your
successive visits to my mother, and it was an accident that my mother
was present at none of them. I have spoken of you as an American of
immense wealth, and the best fellow in the world, who is looking for
something very superior in the way of a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that Madame de Cintré has related to
your mother the last conversation I had with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has not; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own counsel.
Meanwhile you must make your way with the rest of the family. Thus much
is known about you: you have made a great fortune in trade, you are
a little eccentric, and you frankly admire our dear Claire. My
sister-in-law, whom you remember seeing in Madame de Cintré's
sitting-room, took, it appears, a fancy to you; she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has described you
as having _beaucoup de cachet_. My mother, therefore, is curious to see
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) expects to laugh at me, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never laughs. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not like you, don't hope to purchase
favor by being amusing. Take warning by me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>This conversation took place in the evening, and half an hour later
Valentin ushered his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) companion into an apartment of the house of the Rue
de l’Université into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had not yet penetrated, the salon of the
dowager Marquise de Bellegarde. It was a vast, high room, with elaborate
and ponderous mouldings, painted a whitish gray, along the upper portion
of the walls and the ceiling; with a great deal of faded and carefully
repaired tapestry in the doorways and chair-backs; a Turkey carpet in
light colors, still soft and deep, in spite of great antiquity, on the
floor, and portraits of each of Madame de Bellegarde's children, at the
age of ten, suspended against an old screen of red silk. The room was
illumined, exactly enough for conversation, by half a dozen candles,
placed in odd corners, at a great distance apart. In a deep armchair,
near the fire, sat an old lady in black; at the other end of the room
another person was seated at the piano, playing a very expressive
waltz. In this latter person Newman recognized the young Marquise de
Bellegarde.

<p/>Valentin presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) friend, and Newman walked up to the old lady by
the fire and shook hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) received a rapid impression of a
white, delicate, aged face, with a high forehead, a small mouth, and a
pair of cold blue eyes which had kept much of the freshness of youth.
Madame de Bellegarde looked hard at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), and returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand-shake
with a sort of British positiveness which reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
the daughter of the Earl of St. Dunstan's. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter-in-law stopped
playing and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunstan</b></font>) an agreeable smile. Newman sat down and looked
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), while Valentin went and kissed the hand of the young
marquise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to have seen you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``You have
paid several visits to my daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré and I are old friends
by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have gone fast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so fast as I should like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, bravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are very ambitious,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>answered the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I confess I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, smiling.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cold fine eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
returned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gaze, reflecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a possible adversary and
trying to take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) measure. Their eyes remained in contact for some
moments. Then Madame de Bellegarde looked away, and without smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I
am very ambitious, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/>Newman felt that taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) measure was not easy; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a formidable,
inscrutable little woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resembled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
utterly unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The coloring in Madame de Cintré was the same, and
the high delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brow and nose was hereditary. But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was
a larger and freer copy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mouth in especial a happy divergence
from that conservative orifice, a little pair of lips at once plump and
pinched, that looked, when closed, as if they could not open wider than
to swallow a gooseberry or to emit an <div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady</b></font>)</div>which probably had
been thought to give the finishing touch to the aristocratic prettiness
of the Lady Emmeline Atheling as represented, forty years before, in
several Books of Beauty. Madame de Cintré's face had, to Newman's eye,
a range of expression as delightfully vast as the wind-streaked,
cloud-flecked distance on a Western prairie. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) mother's white,
intense, respectable countenance, with its formal gaze, and its
circumscribed smile, suggested a document signed and sealed; a thing
of parchment, ink, and ruled lines. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is a woman of conventions and
proprieties,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) world is the
world of things immutably decreed. But how she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is at home in it, and
what a paradise she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) finds it. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) walks about in it as if it were a
blooming park, a Garden of Eden; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sees `This is genteel,' or
`This is improper,' written on a mile-stone she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stops ecstatically, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) were listening to a nightingale or smelling a rose.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madame de
Bellegarde wore a little black velvet hood tied under her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) chin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
was wrapped in an old black cashmere shawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an American?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) said presently. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen several
Americans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are several in Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman jocosely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, really?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``It was in England I saw
these, or somewhere else; not in Paris. I think it must have been in the
Pyrenees, many years ago. I am told your ladies are very pretty. One of
these ladies was very pretty! such a wonderful complexion! She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) presented
me a note of introduction from someone--I forgot whom--and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sent with
it a note of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own. I kept her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) letter a long time afterwards, it was
so strangely expressed. I used to know some of the phrases by heart. But
I have forgotten them now, it is so many years ago. Since then I have
seen no more Americans. I think my daughter-in-law has; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) is a great
gad-about, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) sees everyone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>At this the younger lady came rustling forward, pinching in a very
slender waist, and casting idly preoccupied glances over the front
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress, which was apparently designed for a ball. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was, in a
singular way, at once ugly and pretty; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had protuberant eyes, and
lips strangely red. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reminded Newman of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend, Mademoiselle
Nioche; this was what that much-obstructed young lady would have liked
to be. Valentin de Bellegarde walked behind her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at a distance, hopping
about to keep off the far-spreading train of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to show more of your shoulders behind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said very gravely.
<div class="bookquote">``You might as well wear a standing ruff as such a dress as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The young woman turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to the mirror over the chimney-piece,
and glanced behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to verify Valentin's assertion. The mirror
descended low, and yet it reflected nothing but a large unclad flesh
surface. The young marquise put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and gave a downward
pull to the waist of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``Like that, you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a little better,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Bellegarde in the same tone, <div class="bookquote">``but it
leaves a good deal to be desired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I never go to extremes,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sister-in-law. And then, turning
to Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``What were you calling me just now, madame?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I called you a gad-about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``But I might call you
something else, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A gad-about? What an ugly word! What does it mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very beautiful person,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman ventured to say, seeing that it was in
French.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a pretty compliment but a bad translation,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the young
marquise. And then, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) a moment, <div class="bookquote">``Do you dance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a step.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, simply. And with another look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
back in the mirror she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the old lady, who was apparently wondering
what was the proper way to talk to an American.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, rather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added with a friendly
intonation, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I know it. I know my house--I know my friends--I don't know
Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you lose a great deal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, sympathetically.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde stared; it was presumably the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
been condoled with on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) losses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am content with what I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said with dignity.

<p/>Newman's eyes, at this moment, were wandering round the room, which
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as rather sad and shabby; passing from the high casements,
with their small, thickly-framed panes, to the sallow tints of two or
three portraits in pastel, of the last century, which hung between
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ought, obviously, to have answered that the contentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
hostess was quite natural--she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) had a great deal; but the idea did not
occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) during the pause of some moments which followed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, coming and leaning against the
chimney-piece, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think of my dear friend Newman? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) not
the excellent fellow I told you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My acquaintance with Mr. Newman has not gone very far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I can as yet only appreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) great politeness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is a great judge of these matters,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin to Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``If you have satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), it is a triumph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall satisfy you, some day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, looking at the old
lady. <div class="bookquote">``I have done nothing yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not listen to my son; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will bring you into trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a
sad scatterbrain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I like him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--I like him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, genially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) amuses you, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear that, Valentin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``You amuse Mr.
Newman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we shall all come to that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must see my other son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is much
better than this one. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will not amuse you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--I don't know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>murmured Valentin, reflectively. <div class="bookquote">``But we
shall very soon see. Here comes _Monsieur mon frère_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The door had just opened to give ingress to a gentleman who stepped
forward and whose face Newman remembered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been the author of our
hero's discomfiture the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tried to present himself to Madame
de Cintré. Valentin de Bellegarde went to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) brother, looked at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) a moment, and then, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) by the arm, led him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) up to Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is my excellent friend Mr. Newman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said very blandly. <div class="bookquote">``You
must know him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to know Mr. Newman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis with a low bow,
but without offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) is the old woman at second-hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
returned M. de Bellegarde's greeting. And this was the starting-point of
a speculative theory, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mind, that the late marquis had been a very
amiable foreigner, with an inclination to take life easily and a sense
that it was difficult for the husband of the stilted little lady by the
fire to do so. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had taken little comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
taken much in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) two younger children, who were after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own heart,
while Madame de Bellegarde had paired with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eldest-born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother has spoken to me of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``and as
you are also acquainted with my sister, it was time we should meet.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother and gallantly bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, touching it with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) lips, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) assumed an attitude before the chimney-piece. With
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) long, lean face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) high-bridged nose and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) small, opaque eye he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
looked much like an Englishman. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) whiskers were fair and glossy, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had a large dimple, of unmistakably British origin, in the middle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) handsome chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``distinguished''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) polished
nails, and there was not a movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) fine, perpendicular person
that was not noble and majestic. Newman had never yet been confronted
with such an incarnation of the art of taking one's self seriously; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
felt a sort of impulse to step backward, as you do to get a view of a
great façade.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Urbain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said young Madame de Bellegarde, who had apparently been
waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) husband to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) ball, <div class="bookquote">``I call your attention
to the fact that I am dressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>murmured Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at your orders, my dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``Only,
you must allow me first the pleasure of a little conversation with Mr.
Newman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you are going to a party, don't let me keep you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>objected
Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am very sure we shall meet again. Indeed, if you would like
to converse with me I will gladly name an hour.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was eager to make
it known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would readily answer all questions and satisfy all
exactions.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde stood in a well-balanced position before the fire,
caressing one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) fair whiskers with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) white hands, and
looking at Newman, half askance, with eyes from which a particular ray
of observation made its way through a general meaningless smile. <div class="bookquote">``It is
very kind of you to make such an offer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If I am not mistaken,
your occupations are such as to make your time precious. You are
in--a--as we say, _dans les affaires_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In business, you mean? Oh no, I have thrown business overboard for the
present. I am `loafing,' as _we_ say. My time is quite my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you are taking a holiday,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>rejoined M. de Bellegarde. ```Loafing.'
Yes, I have heard that expression.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Newman is American,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother is a great ethnologist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``An ethnologist?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you collect negroes' skulls, and
that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis looked hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brother, and began to caress his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) other
whisker. Then, turning to Newman, with sustained urbanity, <div class="bookquote">``You are
traveling for your pleasure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.'

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am knocking about to pick up one thing and another. Of course I
get a good deal of pleasure out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What especially interests you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>inquired the marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, everything interests me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am not particular.
Manufactures are what I care most about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has been your specialty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say I have any specialty. My specialty has been to make the
largest possible fortune in the shortest possible time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman made
this last remark very deliberately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished to open the way, if it
were necessary, to an authoritative statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) means.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde laughed agreeably. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have succeeded,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have made a fortune in a reasonable time. I am not so old, you
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Paris is a very good place to spend a fortune. I wish you great
enjoyment of yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>And M. de Bellegarde drew forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gloves and
began to put them on.

<p/>Newman for a few moments watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sliding his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) white hands into the
white kid, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did so his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feelings took a singular turn. M. de
Bellegarde's good wishes seemed to descend out of the white expanse of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sublime serenity with the soft, scattered movement of a shower of
snow-flakes. Yet Newman was not irritated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
being patronized; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was conscious of no especial impulse to introduce
a discord into so noble a harmony. Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt himself suddenly in
personal contact with the forces with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend Valentin had
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would have to contend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) became sensible of their
intensity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wished to make some answering manifestation, to stretch
himself out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) own length, to sound a note at the uttermost end of
_his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)_ scale. It must be added that if this impulse was not vicious or
malicious, it was by no means void of humorous expectancy. Newman was
quite as ready to give play to that loosely-adjusted smile of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hosts should happen to be shocked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was far from deliberately
planning to shock them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Paris is a very good place for idle people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or it is a very
good place if your family has been settled here for a long time, and you
have made acquaintances and got your relations round you; or if you have
got a good big house like this, and a wife and children and mother and
sister, and everything comfortable. I don't like that way of living all
in rooms next door to each other. But I am not an idler. I try to be,
but I can't manage it; it goes against the grain. My business habits are
too deep-seated. Then, I haven't any house to call my own, or anything
in the way of a family. My sisters are five thousand miles away, my
mother died when I was a youngster, and I haven't any wife; I wish I
had! So, you see, I don't exactly know what to do with myself. I am not
fond of books, as you are, sir, and I get tired of dining out and going
to the opera. I miss my business activity. You see, I began to earn my
living when I was almost a baby, and until a few months ago I have never
had my hand off the plow. Elegant leisure comes hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech was followed by a profound silence of some moments, on the
part of Newman's entertainers. Valentin stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) fixedly,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) pockets, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) slowly, with a half-sidling
motion, went out of the door. The marquis continued to draw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
gloves and to smile benignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You began to earn your living when you were a mere baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the
marquise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly more--a small boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say you are not fond of books,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``but
you must do yourself the justice to remember that your studies were
interrupted early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true; on my tenth birthday I stopped going to school. I
thought it was a grand way to keep it. But I picked up some information
afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, reassuringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have some sisters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked old Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, two sisters. Splendid women!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope that for them the hardships of life commenced less early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They married very early, if you call that a hardship, as girls do in
our Western country. One of them is married to the owner of the largest
india-rubber house in the West.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you make houses also of india-rubber?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>inquired the marquise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can stretch them as your family increases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said young Madame de
Bellegarde, who was muffling herself in a long white shawl.

<p/>Newman indulged in a burst of hilarity, and explained that the house in
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brother-in-law lived was a large wooden structure, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
manufactured and sold india-rubber on a colossal scale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My children have some little india-rubber shoes which they put on
when they go to play in the Tuileries in damp weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the young
marquise. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether your brother-in-law made them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) did, you may be very sure they are
well made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you must not be discouraged,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde, with vague
urbanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean to be. I have a project which gives me plenty to think
about, and that is an occupation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And then Newman was silent a moment,
hesitating, yet thinking rapidly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) point, and yet
to do so forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to speak out in a way that was disagreeable to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued, addressing himself to old Madame de
Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you my project; perhaps you can help me. I want
to take a wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very good project, but I am no matchmaker,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>Newman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an instant, and then, with perfect sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``I
should have thought you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) declared.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde appeared to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) too sincere. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) murmured
something sharply in French, and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son. At this
moment the door of the room was thrown open, and with a rapid step
Valentin reappeared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a message for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sister-in-law. <div class="bookquote">``Claire bids
me to request you not to start for your ball. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) will go with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Claire will go with us!''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>cried the young marquise. <div class="bookquote">``_En voilà, du
nouveau!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) decided half an hour ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is
sticking the last diamond into her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) hair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has taken possession of my daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>demanded Madame de
Bellegarde, sternly. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has not been into the world these three
years. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) take such a step at half an hour's notice, and without
consulting me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) consulted me, dear mother, five minutes since,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin,
<div class="bookquote">``and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) that such a beautiful woman--she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is beautiful, you will
see--had no right to bury herself alive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have referred Claire to her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mother, my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de
Bellegarde, in French. <div class="bookquote">``This is very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I refer her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) to the whole company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) comes!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) went to the open door, met Madame de Cintré on the threshold, took
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) by the hand, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) was dressed in white;
but a long blue cloak, which hung almost to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) feet, was fastened
across her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) shoulders by a silver clasp. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) had tossed it back, however,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) long white arms were uncovered. In her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) dense, fair hair there
glittered a dozen diamonds. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) looked serious and, Newman thought,
rather pale; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) glanced round her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>), and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), smiled
and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) tremendously handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a
chance to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) full in the face, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) stood a moment in the
centre of the room, hesitating, apparently, what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) should do, without
meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) mother, who sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) deep
chair by the fire, looking at Madame de Cintré almost fiercely. With her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)
back turned to the others, Madame de Cintré held her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) cloak apart to show
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) dress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you are audacious,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise. <div class="bookquote">``It was but three days
ago, when I asked you, as a particular favor to myself, to go to the
Duchess de Lusignan's, that you told me you were going nowhere and
that one must be consistent. Is this your consistency? Why should you
distinguish Madame Robineau? Who is it you wish to please to-night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to please myself, dear mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>)
bent over and kissed the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like surprises, my sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Urbain de Bellegarde;
<div class="bookquote">``especially when one is on the point of entering a drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman at this juncture felt inspired to speak. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you are going
into a room with Madame de Cintré, you needn't be afraid of being
noticed yourself!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sister with a smile too intense to be
easy. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you appreciate a compliment that is paid you at your
brother's expense,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, madame.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>And offering Madame
de Cintré his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rapidly out of the room. Valentin rendered
the same service to young Madame de Bellegarde, who had apparently been
reflecting on the fact that the ball-dress of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sister-in-law was
much less brilliant than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own, and yet had failed to derive absolute
comfort from the reflection. With a farewell smile she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sought the
complement of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) consolation in the eyes of the American visitor, and
perceiving in them a certain mysterious brilliancy, it is not improbable
that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may have flattered herself she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had found it.

<p/>Newman, left alone with old Madame de Bellegarde, stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a few
moments in silence. <div class="bookquote">``Your daughter is very beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is very strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``It makes me hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will consent, some day, to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady slowly rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet. <div class="bookquote">``That really is your project,
then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; will you favor it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Favor it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) a moment and then shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you suffer it, then? Will you let it pass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what you ask. I am a very proud and meddlesome old
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am very rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on the floor, and Newman thought
it probable she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was weighing the reasons in favor of resenting the
brutality of this remark. But at last, looking up, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said simply, <div class="bookquote">``How
rich?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) income in a round number which had the magnificent
sound that large aggregations of dollars put on when they are translated
into francs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added a few remarks of a financial character, which
completed a sufficiently striking presentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) resources.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde listened in silence. <div class="bookquote">``You are very frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said
finally. <div class="bookquote">``I will be the same. I would rather favor you, on the whole,
than suffer you. It will be easier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thankful for any terms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But, for the present, you
have suffered me long enough. Good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave.



<p/>CHAPTER XI

<p/>Newman, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) return to Paris, had not resumed the study of French
conversation with M. Nioche; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had too many other uses
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) time. M. Nioche, however, came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) very promptly, having
learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whereabouts by a mysterious process to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) patron
never obtained the key. The shrunken little capitalist repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
visit more than once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed oppressed by a humiliating sense of
having been overpaid, and wished apparently to redeem his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) debt by the
offer of grammatical and statistical information in small installments.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wore the same decently melancholy aspect as a few months before; a
few months more or less of brushing could make little difference in the
antique lustre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) coat and hat. But the poor old man's spirit was a
trifle more threadbare; it seemed to have received some hard rubs during
the summer. Newman inquired with interest about Mademoiselle Noémie;
and M. Nioche, at first, for answer, simply looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in lachrymose
silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I sit and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but I can do
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) misconducts herself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, I am sure. I can't follow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I don't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has something in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head; I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is trying to do.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is too deep for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continue to go to the Louvre? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made any of those copies
for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goes to the Louvre, but I see nothing of the copies. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has
something on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) easel; I suppose it is one of the pictures you ordered.
Such a magnificent order ought to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fairy-fingers. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
not in earnest. I can't say anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); I am afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). One
evening, last summer, when I took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to walk in the Champs Élysées, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
said some things to me that frightened me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What were they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse an unhappy father from telling you,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, unfolding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) calico pocket-handkerchief.

<p/>Newman promised himself to pay Mademoiselle Noémie another visit at the
Louvre. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was curious about the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) copies, but it must
be added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was still more curious about the progress of the young
lady herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went one afternoon to the great museum, and wandered
through several of the rooms in fruitless quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was bending
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) steps to the long hall of the Italian masters, when suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
found himself face to face with Valentin de Bellegarde. The young
Frenchman greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) with ardor, and assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) was a
godsend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) himself was in the worst of humors and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) wanted someone to
contradict.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a bad humor among all these beautiful things?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I
thought you were so fond of pictures, especially the old black ones.
There are two or three here that ought to keep you in spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>answered Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``I am not in a mood for pictures, and
the more beautiful they are the less I like them. Their great staring
eyes and fixed positions irritate me. I feel as if I were at some big,
dull party, in a room full of people I shouldn't wish to speak to. What
should I care for their beauty? It's a bore, and, worse still, it's a
reproach. I have a great many _ennuis_; I feel vicious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If the Louvre has so little comfort for you, why in the world did you
come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is one of my _ennuis_. I came to meet my cousin--a dreadful
English cousin, a member of my mother's family--who is in Paris for
a week for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband, and who wishes me to point out the `principal
beauties.' Imagine a woman who wears a green crape bonnet in December
and has straps sticking out of the ankles of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) interminable boots! My
mother begged I would do something to oblige them. I have undertaken to
play _valet de place_ this afternoon. They were to have met me here
at two o’clock, and I have been waiting for them twenty minutes. Why
doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arrive? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has at least a pair of feet to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I
don't know whether to be furious at their playing me false, or delighted
to have escaped them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think in your place I would be furious,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``because they
may arrive yet, and then your fury will still be of use to you. Whereas
if you were delighted and they were afterwards to turn up, you might not
know what to do with your delight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You give me excellent advice, and I already feel better. I will be
furious; I will let them go to the deuce and I myself will go with
you--unless by chance you too have a rendezvous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not exactly a rendezvous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But I have in fact come
to see a person, not a picture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A woman, presumably?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``I hope for you with all my heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not
clothed in green tulle and that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet are not too much out of focus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know much about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feet, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has very pretty hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin gave a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``And on that assurance I must part with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not certain of finding my young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I am not
quite prepared to lose your company on the chance. It does not strike
me as particularly desirable to introduce you to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and yet I should
rather like to have your opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess you will think so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Bellegarde passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm into that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion. <div class="bookquote">``Conduct me to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
on the instant! I should be ashamed to make a pretty woman wait for my
verdict.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman suffered himself to be gently propelled in the direction in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been walking, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) step was not rapid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was turning
something over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mind. The two men passed into the long gallery of
the Italian masters, and Newman, after having scanned for a moment its
brilliant vista, turned aside into the smaller apartment devoted to
the same school, on the left. It contained very few persons, but at the
farther end of it sat Mademoiselle Nioche, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) easel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
not at work; her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) palette and brushes had been laid down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
hands were folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair and
looking intently at two ladies on the other side of the hall, who, with
their backs turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), had stopped before one of the pictures. These
ladies were apparently persons of high fashion; they were dressed with
great splendor, and their long silken trains and furbelows were spread
over the polished floor. It was at their dresses Mademoiselle Noémie was
looking, though what she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was thinking of I am unable to say. I hazard
the supposition that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was saying to herself that to be able to drag
such a train over a polished floor was a felicity worth any price. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
reflections, at any rate, were disturbed by the advent of Newman and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glanced at them quickly, and then, coloring a little,
rose and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) easel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came here on purpose to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bad French,
offering to shake hands. And then, like a good American, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) introduced
Valentin formally: <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to make you acquainted with the Comte
Valentin de Bellegarde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin made a bow which must have seemed to Mademoiselle Noémie
quite in harmony with the impressiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) title, but the graceful
brevity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own response made no concession to underbred surprise.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned to Newman, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hair and smoothing its
delicately-felt roughness. Then, rapidly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned the canvas that was
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) easel over upon its face. <div class="bookquote">``You have not forgotten me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never forget you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You may be sure of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl, <div class="bookquote">``there are a great many different ways
of remembering a person.''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked straight at Valentin de
Bellegarde, who was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as a gentleman may when a <div class="bookquote">``verdict''
 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>is expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you painted anything for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Have you been
industrious?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have done nothing.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) palette, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to mix
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) colors at hazard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father tells me you have come here constantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have nowhere else to go! Here, all summer, it was cool, at least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Being here, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``you might have tried something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you before,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, softly, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't know how to
paint.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have something charming on your easel, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``if
you would only let me see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) two hands, with the fingers expanded, over the back
of the canvas--those hands which Newman had called pretty, and which, in
spite of several paint-stains, Valentin could now admire. <div class="bookquote">``My painting
is not charming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the only thing about you that is not, then, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>quoth
Valentin, gallantly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little canvas and silently passed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) looked
at it, and in a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are a judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I am.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, then, that that is very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Mon Dieu_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) shoulders <div class="bookquote">``let us
distinguish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I ought not to attempt to paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the young girl
continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Frankly, then, mademoiselle, I think you ought not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to look at the dresses of the two splendid ladies again--a
point on which, having risked one conjecture, I think I may risk
another. While she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was looking at the ladies she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was seeing Valentin
de Bellegarde. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), at all events, was seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) put down the
roughly-besmeared canvas and addressed a little click with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) tongue,
accompanied by an elevation of the eyebrows, to Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where have you been all these months?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>asked Mademoiselle Noémie of our
hero. <div class="bookquote">``You took those great journeys, you amused yourself well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I amused myself well enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie with extreme gentleness, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to dabble in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) colors again. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was singularly pretty, with
the look of serious sympathy that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.

<p/>Valentin took advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) downcast eyes to telegraph again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) renewed his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mysterious physiognomical play, making at the
same time a rapid tremulous movement in the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was
evidently finding Mademoiselle Noémie extremely interesting; the blue
devils had departed, leaving the field clear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me something about your travels,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>murmured the young girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I went to Switzerland,--to Geneva and Zermatt and Zürich and all
those places you know; and down to Venice, and all through Germany, and
down the Rhine, and into Holland and Belgium--the regular round. How do
you say that, in French--the regular round?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked of Valentin.

<p/>Mademoiselle Nioche fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes an instant on Bellegarde, and then
with a little smile, <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
says so much at once. Would you be so good as to translate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would rather talk to you out of my own head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin declared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, gravely, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bad French, <div class="bookquote">``you must not talk
to Mademoiselle Nioche, because you say discouraging things. You ought
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to work, to persevere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And we French, mademoiselle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``are accused of being
false flatterers!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want any flattery, I want only the truth. But I know the
truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All I say is that I suspect there are some things that you can do
better than paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the truth--I know the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>Mademoiselle Noémie repeated. And,
dipping a brush into a clot of red paint, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew a great horizontal
daub across her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unfinished picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/>Without answering, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) drew another long crimson daub, in a vertical
direction, down the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) canvas, and so, in a moment, completed
the rough indication of a cross. <div class="bookquote">``It is the sign of the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said
at last.

<p/>The two men looked at each other, and Valentin indulged in another
flash of physiognomical eloquence. <div class="bookquote">``You have spoiled your picture,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that very well. It was the only thing to do with it. I had sat
looking at it all day without touching it. I had begun to hate it. It
seemed to me something was going to happen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like it better that way than as it was before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Now
it is more interesting. It tells a story. Is it for sale?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything I have is for sale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much is this thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten thousand francs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl, without a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything that Mademoiselle Nioche may do at present is mine in
advance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It makes part of an order I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) some months
ago. So you can't have this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur will lose nothing by it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the young girl, looking at
Valentin. And she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began to put up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) utensils.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have gained a charming memory,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``You are going
away? your day is over?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father is coming to fetch me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Noémie.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had hardly spoken when, through the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), which opens on
one of the great white stone staircases of the Louvre, M. Nioche made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) came in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) usual even, patient shuffle, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) made a low salute to the two gentlemen who were standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
daughter's easel. Newman shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands with muscular friendliness, and
Valentin returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) greeting with extreme deference. While the old man
stood waiting for Noémie to make a parcel of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) implements, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) let
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mild, oblique gaze hover toward Bellegarde, who was watching
Mademoiselle Noémie put on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bonnet and mantle. Valentin was at no
pains to disguise his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) scrutiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) looked at a pretty girl as he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would
have listened to a piece of music. Attention, in each case, was simple
good manners. M. Nioche at last took his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) daughter's paint-box in one
hand and the bedaubed canvas, after giving it a solemn, puzzled stare,
in the other, and led the way to the door. Mademoiselle Noémie made the
young men the salute of a duchess, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``what do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is very remarkable. _Diable, diable, diable!_''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>repeated M. de
Bellegarde, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is very remarkable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a sad little adventuress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a little one--a great one. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has the material.''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>And Valentin
began to walk away slowly, looking vaguely at the pictures on the walls,
with a thoughtful illumination in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eye. Nothing could have appealed
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) imagination more than the possible adventures of a young lady
endowed with the <div class="bookquote">``material''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>of Mademoiselle Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is very
interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a beautiful type.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A beautiful type? What the deuce do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean from the artistic point of view. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is an artist,--outside of
her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) painting, which obviously is execrable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not beautiful. I don't even think her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) very pretty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is quite pretty enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) purposes, and it is a face and
figure on which everything tells. If she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were prettier she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would be less
intelligent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) intelligence is half of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) charm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In what way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, who was much amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion's
immediate philosophisation of Mademoiselle Nioche, <div class="bookquote">``does her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
intelligence strike you as so remarkable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has taken the measure of life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has determined to _be_
something--to succeed at any cost. Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) painting, of course, is a mere
trick to gain time. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) chance; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wishes to launch
herself, and to do it well. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) Paris. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is one of fifty
thousand, so far as the mere ambition goes; but I am very sure that
in the way of resolution and capacity she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is a rarity. And in one
gift--perfect heartlessness--I will warrant she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is unsurpassed. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
has not as much heart as will go on the point of a needle. That is an
immense virtue. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is one of the celebrities of the future.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven help us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``how far the artistic point of view may
take a man! But in this case I must request that you don't let it take
you too far. You have learned a wonderful deal about Mademoiselle
Noémie in a quarter of an hour. Let that suffice; don't follow up your
researches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried Bellegarde with warmth, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I have too good
manners to intrude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not intruding. The girl is nothing to me. In fact, I rather
dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But I like her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) poor old father, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake I beg you
to abstain from any attempt to verify your theories.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the sake of that seedy old gentleman who came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>demanded Valentin, stopping short. And on Newman's assenting, <div class="bookquote">``Ah no, ah
no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``You are quite wrong, my dear fellow; you
needn't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I verily believe that you are accusing the poor gentleman of being
capable of rejoicing in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter's dishonor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Voyons!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``who is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? what is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looks like: as poor as a rat, but very high-toned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly. I noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) perfectly; be sure I do him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has
had losses, _des malheurs_, as we say. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is very low-spirited, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
daughter is too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is the pink of respectability, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
has sixty years of honesty on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back. All this I perfectly appreciate.
But I know my fellow-men and my fellow-Parisians, and I will make a
bargain with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman gave ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bargain and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
would rather his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) daughter were a good girl than a bad one, but if the
worst comes to the worst, the old man will not do what Virginius did.
Success justifies everything. If Mademoiselle Noémie makes a figure,
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) papa will feel--well, we will call it relieved. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will make a
figure. The old gentleman's future is assured.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what Virginius did, but M. Nioche will shoot Miss Noémie,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``After that, I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) future will be assured in some
snug prison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a cynic; I am simply an observer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin rejoined.
<div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Noémie interests me; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is extremely remarkable. If
there is a good reason, in honor or decency, for dismissing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from my
thoughts forever, I am perfectly willing to do it. Your estimate of the
papa's sensibilities is a good reason until it is invalidated. I promise
you not to look at the young girl again until you tell me that you have
changed your mind about the papa. When he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has given distinct proof of
being a philosopher, you will raise your interdict. Do you agree to
that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to bribe him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you admit, then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) is bribable? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) would ask too much,
and it would not be exactly fair. I mean simply to wait. You will
continue, I suppose, to see this interesting couple, and you will give
me the news yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``if the old man turns out a humbug, you may do what
you please. I wash my hands of the matter. For the girl herself, you
may be at rest. I don't know what harm she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may do to me, but I certainly
can't hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). It seems to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that you are very well
matched. You are both hard cases, and M. Nioche and I, I believe, are
the only virtuous men to be found in Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon after this M. de Bellegarde, in punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) levity, received
a stern poke in the back from a pointed instrument. Turning quickly
round he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) found the weapon to be a parasol wielded by a lady in green
gauze bonnet. Valentin's English cousins had been drifting about
unpiloted, and evidently deemed that they had a grievance. Newman left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to their mercies, but with a boundless faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) power to plead
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cause.



<p/>CHAPTER XII

<p/>Three days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) introduction to the family of Madame de Cintré,
Newman, coming in toward evening, found upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) table the card of the
Marquis de Bellegarde. On the following day he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) received a note informing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that the Marquise de Bellegarde would be grateful for the honor of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) company at dinner.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) went, of course, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had to break another engagement to do it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was ushered into the room in which Madame de Bellegarde had received
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) before, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) venerable hostess, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
entire family. The room was lighted only by the crackling fire, which
illuminated the very small pink slippers of a lady who, seated in a low
chair, was stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toes before it. This lady was the younger
Madame de Bellegarde. Madame de Cintré was seated at the other end
of the room, holding a little girl against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knee, the child of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
brother Urbain, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was apparently relating a wonderful story.
Valentin was sitting on a puff, close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sister-in-law, into whose
ear he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was certainly distilling the finest nonsense. The marquis was
stationed before the fire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) head erect and his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>),
in an attitude of formal expectancy.

<p/>Old Madame de Bellegarde stood up to give Newman her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) greeting, and there
was that in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) did so which seemed to measure narrowly the
extent of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) condescension. <div class="bookquote">``We are all alone, you see, we have asked
no one else,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) said austerely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you didn't; this is much more sociable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``Good evening, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand to the marquis.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde was affable, but in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) dignity he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was
restless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) began to pace up and down the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) looked out of the
long windows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took up books and laid them down again. Young Madame
de Bellegarde gave Newman her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) hand without moving and without looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may think that is coldness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``but it is not, it
is warmth. It shows she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is treating you as an intimate. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) detests
me, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is always looking at me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No wonder I detest you if I am always looking at you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady.
<div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Newman does not like my way of shaking hands, I will do it
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div><p/>But this charming privilege was lost upon our hero, who was already
making his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) way across the room to Madame de Cintré. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook hands, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on with the story she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
little niece. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had only two or three phrases to add, but they were
apparently of great moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) deepened her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, smiling as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did
so, and the little girl gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with round eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But in the end the young prince married the beautiful Florabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) off to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) in the Land of
the Pink Sky. There she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was so happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) forgot all her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) troubles,
and went out to drive every day of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) life in an ivory coach drawn by
five hundred white mice. Poor Florabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed to Newman, <div class="bookquote">``had
suffered terribly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had had nothing to eat for six months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Blanche</b></font>)</div>said little Blanche.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but when the six months were over, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had a plum-cake as big as
that ottoman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``That quite set her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) up again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a checkered career!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Are you very fond of children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) say it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to talk with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``we can talk with them so much
more seriously than with grown persons. That is great nonsense that I
have been telling Blanche, but it is a great deal more serious than most
of what we say in society.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would talk to me, then, as if I were Blanche's age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Were you happy at your ball the other night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ecstatically!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are talking the nonsense that we talk in society,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was my own fault if I was not happy. The ball was very pretty, and
everyone very amiable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was on your conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that you had annoyed your
mother and your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment without answering. <div class="bookquote">``That is
true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) replied at last. <div class="bookquote">``I had undertaken more than I could carry
out. I have very little courage; I am not a heroine.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) said this with
a certain soft emphasis; but then, changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) tone, <div class="bookquote">``I could never
have gone through the sufferings of the beautiful Florabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>)
added, not even for her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) prospective rewards.

<p/>Dinner was announced, and Newman betook himself to the side of the old
Madame de Bellegarde. The dining-room, at the end of a cold corridor,
was vast and sombre; the dinner was simple and delicately excellent.
Newman wondered whether Madame de Cintré had had something to do with
ordering the repast and greatly hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) had. Once seated at table,
with the various members of the ancient house of Bellegarde around
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked himself the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) position. Was the old lady
responding to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) advances? Did the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was a solitary guest
augment his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) credit or diminish it? Were they ashamed to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to
other people, or did they wish to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) a sign of sudden adoption
into their last reserve of favor? Newman was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) guard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
watchful and conjectural; and yet at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was vaguely
indifferent. Whether they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a long rope or a short one he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
there now, and Madame de Cintré was opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a tall
candlestick on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would sit there for the next hour,
and that was enough. The dinner was extremely solemn and measured; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
wondered whether this was always the state of things in <div class="bookquote">``old families.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head very high, and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, which
looked peculiarly sharp in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little, finely-wrinkled white face, very
intently upon the table-service. The marquis appeared to have decided
that the fine arts offered a safe subject of conversation, as not
leading to startling personal revelations. Every now and then, having
learned from Newman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been through the museums of Europe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
uttered some polished aphorism upon the flesh-tints of Rubens and the
good taste of Sansovino. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rubens</b></font>) manners seemed to indicate a fine, nervous
dread that something disagreeable might happen if the atmosphere were
not purified by allusions of a thoroughly superior cast. <div class="bookquote">``What under
the sun is the man afraid of?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked himself. <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think I am
going to offer to swap jack-knives with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>It was useless to shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
eyes to the fact that the marquis was profoundly disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never been a man of strong personal aversions; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) nerves had not
been at the mercy of the mystical qualities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neighbors. But here
was a man towards whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was irresistibly in opposition; a man of
forms and phrases and postures; a man full of possible impertinences
and treacheries. M. de Bellegarde made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) feel as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) were standing
bare-footed on a marble floor; and yet, to gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) desire, Newman felt
perfectly able to stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wondered what Madame de Cintré thought of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) being accepted, if accepted it was. There was no judging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
face, which expressed simply the desire to be gracious in a manner which
should require as little explicit recognition as possible. Young Madame
de Bellegarde had always the same manners; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was always preoccupied,
distracted, listening to everything and hearing nothing, looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) rings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) finger-nails, seeming rather bored, and yet
puzzling you to decide what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) ideal of social diversion. Newman
was enlightened on this point later. Even Valentin did not quite seem
master of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wits; his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) vivacity was fitful and forced, yet Newman
observed that in the lapses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) talk he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appeared excited. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes
had an intenser spark than usual. The effect of all this was that
Newman, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) life, was not himself; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
measured his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) movements, and counted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) words, and resolved that if the
occasion demanded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should appear to have swallowed a ramrod, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
would meet the emergency.

<p/>After dinner M. de Bellegarde proposed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) guest that they should go
into the smoking-room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) led the way toward a small, somewhat
musty apartment, the walls of which were ornamented with old hangings of
stamped leather and trophies of rusty arms. Newman refused a cigar, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) established himself upon one of the divans, while the marquis puffed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own weed before the fire-place, and Valentin sat looking through the
light fumes of a cigarette from one to the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't keep quiet any longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, at last. <div class="bookquote">``I must tell
you the news and congratulate you. My brother seems unable to come to
the point; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) revolves around his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) announcement like the priest around
the altar. You are accepted as a candidate for the hand of our sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Valentin, be a little proper!''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>murmured the marquis, with a look of the
most delicate irritation contracting the bridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) high nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There has been a family council,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man continued; <div class="bookquote">``my mother
and Urbain have put their heads together, and even my testimony has
not been altogether excluded. My mother and the marquis sat at a table
covered with green cloth; my sister-in-law and I were on a bench against
the wall. It was like a committee at the Corps Législatif. We were
called up, one after the other, to testify. We spoke of you very
handsomely. Madame de Bellegarde said that if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) had not been told who
you were, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) would have taken you for a duke--an American duke, the
Duke of California. I said that I could warrant you grateful for the
smallest favors--modest, humble, unassuming. I was sure that you would
know your own place, always, and never give us occasion to remind you of
certain differences. After all, you couldn't help it if you were not
a duke. There were none in your country; but if there had been, it was
certain that, smart and active as you are, you would have got the pick
of the titles. At this point I was ordered to sit down, but I think I
made an impression in your favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) brother with dangerous coldness, and
gave a smile as thin as the edge of a knife. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) removed a spark of
cigar-ash from the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) coat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eyes for a while on
the cornice of the room, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) inserted one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) white hands
into the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">``I must apologize to you for the
deplorable levity of my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I must notify you that
this is probably not the last time that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) want of tact will cause you
serious embarrassment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I confess I have no tact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Is your embarrassment
really painful, Newman? The marquis will put you right again; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own
touch is deliciously delicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Valentin, I am sorry to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>the marquis continued, <div class="bookquote">``has never
possessed the tone, the manner, that belongs to a young man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
position. It has been a great affliction to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, who is very fond
of the old traditions. But you must remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks for no one
but himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, good-humoredly. <div class="bookquote">``I know what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) amounts to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the good old times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``marquises and counts used
to have their appointed fools and jesters, to crack jokes for them.
Nowadays we see a great strapping democrat keeping a count about him (<font color='blue'><b>democrat</b></font>)
to play the fool. It's a good situation, but I certainly am very
degenerate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eyes for some time on the floor. <div class="bookquote">``My mother
informed me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said presently, <div class="bookquote">``of the announcement that you made to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) the other evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I desired to marry your sister?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That you wished to arrange a marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis Cintré</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, slowly,
<div class="bookquote">``with my sister, the Comtesse de Cintré. The proposal was serious, and
required, on my mother's part, a great deal of reflection. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) naturally
took me into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) counsels, and I gave my most zealous attention to the
subject. There was a great deal to be considered; more than you appear
to imagine. We have viewed the question on all its faces, we have
weighed one thing against another. Our conclusion has been that we favor
your suit. My mother has desired me to inform you of our decision. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
will have the honor of saying a few words to you on the subject herself.
Meanwhile, by us, the heads of the family, you are accepted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman got up and came nearer to the marquis. <div class="bookquote">``You will do nothing to
hinder me, and all you can to help me, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will recommend my sister to accept you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face, and pressed it for a moment upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes. This promise had a great sound, and yet the pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took
in it was embittered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) having to stand there so and receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
passport from M. de Bellegarde. The idea of having this gentleman mixed
up with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wooing and wedding was more and more disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
But Newman had resolved to go through the mill, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) imagined it, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not cry out at the first turn of the wheel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was silent a
while, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, with a certain dryness which Valentin told him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
afterwards had a very grand air, <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I take note of the promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``I register the vow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde began to gaze at the cornice again; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) apparently had
something more to say. <div class="bookquote">``I must do my mother the justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``I
must do myself the justice, to say that our decision was not easy. Such
an arrangement was not what we had expected. The idea that my sister
should marry a gentleman--ah--in business was something of a novelty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I told you, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) finger at Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The novelty has not quite worn away, I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>the marquis went on;
<div class="bookquote">``perhaps it never will, entirely. But possibly that is not altogether
to be regretted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thin smile again. <div class="bookquote">``It may be that the
time has come when we should make some concession to novelty. There
had been no novelties in our house for a great many years. I made the
observation to my mother, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did me the honor to admit that it was
worthy of attention.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>interrupted Valentin, ``is not your memory just
here leading you the least bit astray? Our mother is, I may say,
distinguished for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) small respect of abstract reasoning. Are you
very sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) replied to your striking proposition in the gracious
manner you describe? You know how terribly incisive she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is sometimes.
Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), rather, do you the honor to say, `A fiddlestick for your
phrases! There are better reasons than that?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Other reasons were discussed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, without looking
at Valentin, but with an audible tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) voice; <div class="bookquote">``some of them
possibly were better. We are conservative, Mr. Newman, but we are not
also bigots. We judged the matter liberally. We have no doubt that
everything will be comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had stood listening to these remarks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms folded and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
eyes fastened upon M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``Comfortable?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, with a sort
of grim flatness of intonation. <div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't we be comfortable? If you
are not, it will be your own fault; I have everything to make _me_ so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother means that with the lapse of time you may get used to the
change'' (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>--and Valentin paused, to light another cigarette.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What change?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman in the same tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Urbain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, very gravely, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that Mr. Newman does
not quite realize the change. We ought to insist upon that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother goes too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``It is his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fatal want
of tact again. It is my mother's wish, and mine, that no such allusions
should be made. Pray never make them yourself. We prefer to assume
that the person accepted as the possible husband of my sister is one
of ourselves, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should have no explanations to make. With a
little discretion on both sides, everything, I think, will be easy. That
is exactly what I wished to say--that we quite understand what we
have undertaken, and that you may depend upon our adhering to our
resolution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hands in the air and then buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) face in them. <div class="bookquote">``I
have less tact than I might have, no doubt; but oh, my brother, if you
knew what you yourself were saying!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) went off into a long laugh.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde's face flushed a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head higher,
as if to repudiate this concession to vulgar perturbability. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure
you understand me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said to Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I don't understand you at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But you needn't
mind that. I don't care. In fact, I think I had better not understand
you. I might not like it. That wouldn't suit me at all, you know. I want
to marry your sister, that's all; to do it as quickly as possible, and
to find fault with nothing. I don't care how I do it. I am not marrying
you, you know, sir. I have got my leave, and that is all I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better receive the last word from my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good; I will go and get it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) prepared to
return to the drawing-room.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde made a motion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to pass first, and when Newman
had gone out he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shut himself into the room with Valentin. Newman had
been a trifle bewildered by the audacious irony of the younger brother,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not needed its aid to point the moral of M. de Bellegarde's
transcendent patronage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had wit enough to appreciate the force
of that civility which consists in calling your attention to the
impertinences it spares you. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had felt warmly the delicate
sympathy with himself that underlay Valentin's fraternal irreverence,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was most unwilling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) friend should pay a tax upon it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) paused a moment in the corridor, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had gone a few steps,
expecting to hear the resonance of M. de Bellegarde's displeasure; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) detected only a perfect stillness. The stillness itself seemed a
trifle portentous; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) reflected however that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had no right to stand
listening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) way back to the salon. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) absence several
persons had come in. They were scattered about the room in groups,
two or three of them having passed into a small boudoir, next to the
drawing-room, which had now been lighted and opened. Old Madame de
Bellegarde was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) place by the fire, talking to a very old gentleman
in a wig and a profuse white neck cloth of the fashion of 1820. Madame
de Cintré was bending a listening head to the historic confidences of
an old lady who was presumably the wife of the old gentleman in the
neckcloth, an old lady in a red satin dress and an ermine cape, who
wore across her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) forehead a band with a topaz set in it. Young Madame
de Bellegarde, when Newman came in, left some people among whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
sitting, and took the place that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had occupied before dinner. Then
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a little push to the puff that stood near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and by a glance
at Newman seemed to indicate that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had placed it in position for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went and took possession of it; the marquis's wife amused and puzzled
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know your secret,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bad but charming English; <div class="bookquote">``you
need make no mystery of it. You wish to marry my sister-in-law. _C’est
un beau choix_. A man like you ought to marry a tall, thin woman. You
must know that I have spoken in your favor; you owe me a famous taper!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have spoken to Madame de Cintré?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, not that. You may think it strange, but my sister-in-law and
I are not so intimate as that. No; I spoke to my husband and my
mother-in-law; I said I was sure we could do what we chose with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``but you can't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that very well; I didn't believe a word of it. But I wanted you
to come into the house; I thought we should be friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be too sure. If you like Madame de Cintré so much, perhaps you
will not like me. We are as different as blue and pink. But you and I
have something in common. I have come into this family by marriage; you
want to come into it in the same way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>interrupted Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I only want to take Madame de
Cintré out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, to cast your nets you have to go into the water. Our positions
are alike; we shall be able to compare notes. What do you think of my
husband? It's a strange question, isn't it? But I shall ask you some
stranger ones yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps a stranger one will be easier to answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You
might try me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you get off very well; the old Comte de la Rochefidèle, yonder,
couldn't do it better. I told them that if we only gave you a chance you
would be a perfect _talon rouge_. I know something about men. Besides,
you and I belong to the same camp. I am a ferocious democrat. By birth
I am _vieille roche_; a good little bit of the history of France is
the history of my family. Oh, you never heard of us, of course! _Ce que
c’est que la gloire!_ We are much better than the Bellegardes, at any
rate. But I don't care a pin for my pedigree; I want to belong to my
time. I'm a revolutionist, a radical, a child of the age! I am sure I go
beyond you. I like clever people, wherever they come from, and I take my
amusement wherever I find it. I don't pout at the Empire; here all the
world pouts at the Empire. Of course I have to mind what I say; but I
expect to take my revenge with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde discoursed
for some time longer in this sympathetic strain, with an eager abundance
which seemed to indicate that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) opportunities for revealing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
esoteric philosophy were indeed rare. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped that Newman would never
be afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), however he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might be with the others, for, really,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went very far indeed. <div class="bookquote">``Strong people'' (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>--_le gens forts_--were in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) opinion equal, all the world over. Newman listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with an
attention at once beguiled and irritated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wondered what the deuce
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), too, was driving at, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not be afraid of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) protestations of equality. In so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could understand
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was wrong; a silly, rattling woman was certainly not the equal
of a sensible man, preoccupied with an ambitious passion. Madame de
Bellegarde stopped suddenly, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sharply, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fan.
<div class="bookquote">``I see you don't believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are too much on your guard.
You will not form an alliance, offensive or defensive? You are very
wrong; I could help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was very grateful and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would certainly
ask for help; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should see. <div class="bookquote">``But first of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I must help
myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to join Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been telling Madame de la Rochefidèle that you are an American,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came up. <div class="bookquote">``It interests her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) greatly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father went over
with the French troops to help you in your battles in the last century,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has always, in consequence, wanted greatly to see an American.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has never succeeded till to-night. You are the first--to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
knowledge--that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has ever looked at.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de la Rochefidèle had an aged, cadaverous face, with a falling of
the lower jaw which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips together, and
reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) conversations to a series of impressive but inarticulate
gutturals. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised an antique eyeglass, elaborately mounted in chased
silver, and looked at Newman from head to foot. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said something
to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) listened deferentially, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) completely failed to
understand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de la Rochefidèle says that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have
seen Americans without knowing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Cintré explained. Newman
thought it probable she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen a great many things without knowing it;
and the old lady, again addressing herself to utterance, declared--as
interpreted by Madame de Cintré--that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had known it.

<p/>At this moment the old gentleman who had been talking to the elder
Madame de Bellegarde drew near, leading the marquise on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) arm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
wife pointed out Newman to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), apparently explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remarkable
origin. M. de la Rochefidèle, whose old age was rosy and rotund, spoke
very neatly and clearly, almost as prettily, Newman thought, as M.
Nioche. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been enlightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned to Newman with an
inimitable elderly grace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monsieur is by no means the first American that I have seen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.
<div class="bookquote">``Almost the first person I ever saw--to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--was an American.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, sympathetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The great Dr. Franklin,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de la Rochefidèle/Rochefidèle</b></font>)</div>said M. de la Rochefidèle. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I was
very young. He (<font color='blue'><b>Franklin</b></font>) was received very well in our _monde._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not better than Mr. Newman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I beg he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
will offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm into the other room. I could have offered no higher
privilege to Dr. Franklin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, complying with Madame de Bellegarde's request, perceived that
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two sons had returned to the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) scanned their faces
an instant for traces of the scene that had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) separation from
them, but the marquis seemed neither more nor less frigidly grand than
usual, and Valentin was kissing ladies' hands with at least his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) habitual
air of self-abandonment to the act. Madame de Bellegarde gave a glance
at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eldest son, and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had crossed the threshold of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) boudoir he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side. The room was now empty and offered
a sufficient degree of privacy. The old lady disengaged herself from
Newman's arm and rested her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand on the arm of the marquis; and in this
position she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood a moment, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head high and biting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) small
under-lip. I am afraid the picture was lost upon Newman, but Madame de
Bellegarde was, in fact, at this moment a striking image of the dignity
which--even in the case of a little time-shrunken old lady--may reside
in the habit of unquestioned authority and the absoluteness of a social
theory favorable to yourself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son has spoken to you as I desired,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and you understand
that we shall not interfere. The rest will lie with yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``M. de Bellegarde told me several things I didn't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman, <div class="bookquote">``but I made out that. You will leave me open field. I am much
obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to add a word that my son probably did not feel at liberty to
say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>the marquise rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``I must say it for my own peace of mind. We
are stretching a point; we are doing you a great favor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, your son said it very well; didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so well as my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>declared the marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can only repeat--I am much obliged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is proper I should tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde went on, <div class="bookquote">``that I
am very proud, and that I hold my head very high. I may be wrong, but
I am too old to change. At least I know it, and I don't pretend to
anything else. Don't flatter yourself that my daughter is not proud. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
is proud in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own way--a somewhat different way from mine. You will
have to make your terms with that. Even Valentin is proud, if you touch
the right spot--or the wrong one. Urbain is proud; that you see for
yourself. Sometimes I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) is a little too proud; but I wouldn't
change him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) is the best of my children; he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) cleaves to his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) old mother.
But I have said enough to show you that we are all proud together. It is
well that you should know the sort of people you have come among.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I can only say, in return, that I am _not_
proud; I shan't mind you! But you speak as if you intended to be very
disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not enjoy having my daughter marry you, and I shall not pretend
to enjoy it. If you don't mind that, so much the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you stick to your own side of the contract we shall not quarrel;
that is all I ask of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Keep your hands off, and
give me an open field. I am very much in earnest, and there is not the
slightest danger of my getting discouraged or backing out. You will have
me constantly before your eyes; if you don't like it, I am sorry for
you. I will do for your daughter, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will accept me, everything that
a man can do for a woman. I am happy to tell you that, as a promise--a
pledge. I consider that on your side you make me an equal pledge. You
will not back out, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't know what you mean by `backing out,''' said the marquise.
<div class="bookquote">``It suggests a movement of which I think no Bellegarde has ever been
guilty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our word is our word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Urbain. <div class="bookquote">``We have given it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you are so proud. It makes me
believe that you will keep it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquise was silent a moment, and then, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I shall always be
polite to you, Mr. Newman,''  (<font color='red'><b>The marquise</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) declared, <div class="bookquote">``but, decidedly, I shall never
like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be too sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sure that I will ask you to take me back to my armchair without
the least fear of having my sentiments modified by the service you
render me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>And Madame de Bellegarde took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) arm, and returned to the
salon and to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) customary place.

<p/>M. de la Rochefidèle and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wife were preparing to take their leave,
and Madame de Cintré's interview with the mumbling old lady was at an
end. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), asking herself, apparently to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
should next speak, when Newman came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mother has given me leave--very solemnly--to come here often,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to come often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered simply. And then, in a
moment: <div class="bookquote">``You probably think it very strange that there should be such a
solemnity--as you say--about your coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes; I do, rather.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember what my brother Valentin said, the first time you came
to see me--that we were a strange, strange family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was not the first time I came, but the second,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true. Valentin annoyed me at the time, but now I know you better,
I may tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was right. If you come often, you will see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>and
Madame de Cintré turned away.

<p/>Newman watched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a while, talking with other people, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shook hands last with Valentin de Bellegarde, who came out
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to the top of the staircase. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you have got your permit,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you liked the process.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I like your sister, more than ever. But don't worry your brother any
more for my sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came
down on you in the smoking-room, after I went out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When my brother comes down on me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) falls hard. I
have a peculiar way of receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I must say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that
they came up to the mark much sooner than I expected. I don't understand
it, they must have had to turn the screw pretty tight. It's a tribute to
your millions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's the most precious one they have ever received,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was turning away when Valentin stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) with a
brilliant, softly-cynical glance. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know whether, within
a few days, you have seen your venerable friend M. Nioche.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was yesterday at my rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't see the muzzle of a pistol sticking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you driving at?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman demanded. <div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed rather
cheerful for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin broke into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear it! I win my bet.
Mademoiselle Noémie has thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cap over the mill, as we say. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
has left the paternal domicile. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is launched! And M. Nioche is rather
cheerful--_for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)!_ Don't brandish your tomahawk at that rate; I have
not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nor communicated with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) since that day at the Louvre.
Andromeda has found another Perseus than I. My information is exact;
on such matters it always is. I suppose that now you will raise your
protest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My protest be hanged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>murmured Newman, disgustedly.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) tone found no echo in that in which Valentin, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand on
the door, to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mother's apartment, exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``But I shall
see her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now! She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is very remarkable--she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is very remarkable!''



 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIII

<p/>Newman kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) promise, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) menace, of going often to the Rue de
l’Université, and during the next six weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw Madame de Cintré more
times than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could have numbered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) flattered himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not
in love, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) biographer may be supposed to know better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) claimed,
at least, none of the exemptions and emoluments of the romantic passion.
Love, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) believed, made a fool of a man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) present emotion was not
folly but wisdom; wisdom sound, serene, well-directed. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt
was an intense, all-consuming tenderness, which had for its object an
extraordinarily graceful and delicate, and at the same time impressive,
woman who lived in a large gray house on the left bank of the Seine.
This tenderness turned very often into a positive heartache; a sign
in which, certainly, Newman ought to have read the appellation which
science has conferred upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sentiment. When the heart has a heavy
weight upon it, it hardly matters whether the weight be of gold or of
lead; when, at any rate, happiness passes into that place in which it
becomes identical with pain, a man may admit that the reign of wisdom
is temporarily suspended. Newman wished Madame de Cintré so well that
nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could think of doing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) in the future rose to the high
standard which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) present mood had set itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) so
felicitous a product of nature and circumstance that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) invention,
musing on future combinations, was constantly catching its breath with
the fear of stumbling into some brutal compression or mutilation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
beautiful personal harmony. This is what I mean by Newman's tenderness:
Madame de Cintré pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) so, exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) desire
to interpose between her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) and the troubles of life had the quality of a
young mother's eagerness to protect the sleep of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) first-born child.
Newman was simply charmed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) handled his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) charm as if it were a
music-box which would stop if one shook it. There can be no better proof
of the hankering epicure that is hidden in every man's temperament,
waiting for a signal from some divine confederate that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may safely
peep out. Newman at last was enjoying, purely, freely, deeply. Certain
of Madame de Cintré's personal qualities--the luminous sweetness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) eyes, the delicate mobility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) face, the deep liquidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
voice--filled all his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) consciousness. A rose-crowned Greek of old, gazing
at a marble goddess with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whole bright intellect resting satisfied
in the act, could not have been a more complete embodiment of the wisdom
that loses itself in the enjoyment of quiet harmonies.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made no violent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>)--no sentimental speeches. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) never
trespassed on what she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) understand was for the present
forbidden ground. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had, nevertheless, a comfortable sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>)
knew better from day to day how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>). Though in general
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was no great talker, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) talked much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) succeeded perfectly in
making her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) say many things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not afraid of boring her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>), either by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) discourse or by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) silence; and whether or no he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did occasionally
bore her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>), it is probable that on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) only the better
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) absence of embarrassed scruples. Her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) visitors, coming in
often while Newman sat there, found a tall, lean, silent man in a
half-lounging attitude, who laughed out sometimes when no one had
meant to be droll, and remained grave in the presence of calculated
witticisms, for appreciation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had apparently not the proper
culture.

<p/>It must be confessed that the number of subjects upon which Newman had
no ideas was extremely large, and it must be added that as regards those
subjects upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was without ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was also perfectly without
words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had little of the small change of conversation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stock
of ready-made formulas and phrases was the scantiest. On the other hand
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had plenty of attention to bestow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) estimate of the importance
of a topic did not depend upon the number of clever things he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could say
about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) himself was almost never bored, and there was no man with
whom it would have been a greater mistake to suppose that silence
meant displeasure. What it was that entertained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) during some of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
speechless sessions I must, however, confess myself unable to determine.
We know in a general way that a great many things which were old stories
to a great many people had the charm of novelty to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but a complete
list of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new impressions would probably contain a number of surprises
for us. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told Madame de Cintré a hundred long stories; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained
to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in talking of the United States, the working of various local
institutions and mercantile customs. Judging by the sequel she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
interested, but one would not have been sure of it beforehand. As
regards her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own talk, Newman was very sure himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) herself
enjoyed it: this was as a sort of amendment to the portrait that Mrs.
Tristram had drawn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) discovered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had naturally an
abundance of gaiety. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been right at first in saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was shy;
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) shyness, in a woman whose circumstances and tranquil beauty afforded
every facility for well-mannered hardihood, was only a charm the more.
For Newman it had lasted some time, and even when it went it left
something behind it which for a while performed the same office. Was
this the tearful secret of which Mrs. Tristram had had a glimpse, and
of which, as of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend's reserve, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) high-breeding, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
profundity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had given a sketch of which the outlines were, perhaps,
rather too heavy? Newman supposed so, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found himself wondering
less every day what Madame de Cintré's secrets might be, and more
convinced that secrets were, in themselves, hateful things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
was a woman for the light, not for the shade; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) natural line was
not picturesque reserve and mysterious melancholy, but frank, joyous,
brilliant action, with just so much meditation as was necessary, and
not a grain more. To this, apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had succeeded in bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) felt, himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was an antidote to oppressive secrets;
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was, in fact, above all things a vast, sunny
immunity from the need of having any.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) often passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) evenings, when Madame de Cintré had so appointed it,
at the chilly fireside of Madame de Bellegarde, contenting himself with
looking across the room, through narrowed eyelids, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mistress,
who always made a point, before her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) family, of talking to someone else.
Madame de Bellegarde sat by the fire conversing neatly and coldly
with whomsoever approached her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and glancing round the room with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
slowly-restless eye, the effect of which, when it lighted upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), was
to Newman's sense identical with that of a sudden spurt of damp air.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shook hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) always asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with a laugh whether
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) could <div class="bookquote">``stand him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>another evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) replied, without a laugh,
that thank God she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had always been able to do her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) duty. Newman, talking
once of the marquise to Mrs. Tristram, said that after all it was very
easy to get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>); it always was easy to get on with out-and-out
rascals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And is it by that elegant term,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that you
designate the Marquise de Bellegarde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is wicked, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is an old sinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) crime?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had murdered someone--all from a sense of
duty, of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you be so dreadful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Tristram.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not dreadful. I am speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) favorably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray what will you say when you want to be severe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall keep my severity for someone else--for the marquis. There's a
man I can't swallow, mix the drink as I will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what has _he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ done?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't quite make out; it is something dreadfully bad, something
mean and underhand, and not redeemed by audacity, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's
misdemeanors may have been. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never committed murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has at
least turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and looked the other way while someone else was
committing it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of this invidious hypothesis, which must be taken for nothing
more than an example of the capricious play of <div class="bookquote">``American humor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
did his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) best to maintain an easy and friendly style of communication
with M. de Bellegarde. So long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was in personal contact with people
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) disliked extremely to have anything to forgive them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was
capable of a good deal of unsuspected imaginative effort -LRB-for the sake
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own personal comfort-RRB- to assume for the time that they were
good fellows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) best to treat the marquis as one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) believed
honestly, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) could not, in reason, be such a confounded
fool as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) seemed. Newman's familiarity was never importunate; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sense
of human equality was not an aggressive taste or an æsthetic theory, but
something as natural and organic as a physical appetite which had
never been put on a scanty allowance and consequently was innocent of
ungraceful eagerness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tranquil unsuspectingness of the relativity
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own place in the social scale was probably irritating to M.
de Bellegarde, who saw himself reflected in the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) potential
brother-in-law in a crude and colorless form, unpleasantly dissimilar
to the impressive image projected upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own intellectual mirror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
never forgot himself for an instant, and replied to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) must have
considered Newman's <div class="bookquote">``advances''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>with mechanical politeness. Newman, who
was constantly forgetting himself, and indulging in an unlimited amount
of irresponsible inquiry and conjecture, now and then found himself
confronted by the conscious, ironical smile of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) host. What the
deuce M. de Bellegarde was smiling at he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was at a loss to divine. M.
de Bellegarde's smile may be supposed to have been, for himself, a
compromise between a great many emotions. So long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) smiled he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
was polite, and it was proper he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) should be polite. A smile, moreover,
committed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to nothing more than politeness, and left the degree of
politeness agreeably vague. A smile, too, was neither dissent--which
was too serious--nor agreement, which might have brought on terrible
complications. And then a smile covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own personal dignity, which
in this critical situation he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was resolved to keep immaculate; it was
quite enough that the glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) house should pass into eclipse.
Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) and Newman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whole manner seemed to declare there could
be no interchange of opinion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) breath so as not
to inhale the odor of democracy. Newman was far from being versed in
European politics, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) liked to have a general idea of what was going
on about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) accordingly asked M. de Bellegarde several times
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) thought of public affairs. M. de Bellegarde answered with suave
concision that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) thought as ill of them as possible, that they were
going from bad to worse, and that the age was rotten to its core. This
gave Newman, for the moment, an almost kindly feeling for the marquis;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pitied a man for whom the world was so cheerless a place, and the
next time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw M. de Bellegarde he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) attempted to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) attention
to some of the brilliant features of the time. The marquis presently
replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had but a single political conviction, which was enough
for him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) believed in the divine right of Henry of Bourbon, Fifth
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) name, to the throne of France. Newman stared, and after this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
ceased to talk politics with M. de Bellegarde. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was not horrified nor
scandalized, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was not even amused; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) felt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) should have felt if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had discovered in M. de Bellegarde a taste for certain oddities of
diet; an appetite, for instance, for fishbones or nutshells. Under these
circumstances, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) would never have broached dietary questions
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).

<p/>One afternoon, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) calling on Madame de Cintré, Newman was requested
by the servant to wait a few moments, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hostess was not at liberty.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked about the room a while, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) books, smelling her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
flowers, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) prints and photographs -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought
prodigiously pretty-RRB-, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard the opening of a door to
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) back was turned. On the threshold stood an old woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
remembered to have met several times in entering and leaving the house.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tall and straight and dressed in black, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a cap
which, if Newman had been initiated into such mysteries, would have been
a sufficient assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not a Frenchwoman; a cap of pure
British composition. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a pale, decent, depressed-looking face, and
a clear, dull, English eye. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at Newman a moment, both intently
and timidly, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dropped a short, straight English curtsey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré begs you will kindly wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has just
come in; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will soon have finished dressing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will wait as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Pray tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not
to hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, softly; and then, instead of retiring
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) message, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) advanced into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a
moment, and presently went to a table and began to arrange certain books
and knick-knacks. Newman was struck with the high respectability of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appearance; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was afraid to address her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a servant. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) busied
herself for some moments with putting the table in order and pulling the
curtains straight, while Newman walked slowly to and fro. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perceived
at last from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reflection in the mirror, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was passing that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hands were idle and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) intently. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) evidently
wished to say something, and Newman, perceiving it, helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to begin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are English?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, quickly and softly; <div class="bookquote">``I was born in
Wiltshire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think of Paris?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't think of Paris, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in the same tone. <div class="bookquote">``It is so
long since I have been here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have been here very long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is more than forty years, sir. I came over with Lady Emmeline.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean with old Madame de Bellegarde?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I came with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emmeline</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emmeline</b></font>) was married. I was my lady's own
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emmeline</b></font>) ever since?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been in the house ever since. My lady has taken a younger
person. You see I am very old. I do nothing regular now. But I keep
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look very strong and well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, observing the erectness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) figure, and a certain venerable rosiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God I am not ill, sir; I hope I know my duty too well to go
panting and coughing about the house. But I am an old woman, sir, and it
is as an old woman that I venture to speak to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, speak out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, curiously. <div class="bookquote">``You needn't be afraid of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. I think you are kind. I have seen you before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the stairs, you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir. When you have been coming to see the countess. I have taken
the liberty of noticing that you come often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; I come very often,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``You need not have
been wide-awake to notice that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have noticed it with pleasure, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the ancient tirewoman,
gravely. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood looking at Newman with a strange expression of
face. The old instinct of deference and humility was there; the habit
of decent self-effacement and knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``own place.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>But there
mingled with it a certain mild audacity, born of the occasion and of a
sense, probably, of Newman's unprecedented approachableness, and, beyond
this, a vague indifference to the old proprieties; as if my lady's own
woman had at last begun to reflect that, since my lady had taken another
person, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a slight reversionary property in herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take a great interest in the family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A deep interest, sir. Especially in the countess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. And in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``So
do I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I suppose, sir. We can't help noticing these things and having our
ideas; can we, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean as a servant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there it is, sir. I am afraid that when I let my thoughts meddle
with such matters I am no longer a servant. But I am so devoted to the
countess; if she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) were my own child I couldn't love her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) more. That is how
I come to be so bold, sir. They say you want to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman eyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) interlocutress and satisfied himself that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not
a gossip, but a zealot; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked anxious, appealing, discreet. <div class="bookquote">``It is
quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to marry Madame de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to take her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) away to America?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) wants to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The farther away the better, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old woman, with sudden
intensity. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) checked herself, and, taking up a paper-weight in
mosaic, began to polish it with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) black apron. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean anything
against the house or the family, sir. But I think a great change would
do the poor countess good. It is very sad here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's not very lively,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But Madame de Cintré is gay
herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is everything that is good. You will not be vexed to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
has been gayer for a couple of months past than she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) had been in many a
day before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was delighted to gather this testimony to the prosperity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
suit, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) repressed all violent marks of elation. <div class="bookquote">``Has Madame de
Cintré been in bad spirits before this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had good reason. M. de Cintré was no husband for a sweet
young lady like that. And then, as I say, it has been a sad house. It is
better, in my humble opinion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were out of it. So, if you will
excuse me for saying so, I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must not lose courage, sir, if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't make up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind at
once. That is what I wanted to beg of you, sir. Don't give it up, sir.
You will not take it ill if I say it's a great risk for any lady at any
time; all the more when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has got rid of one bad bargain. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
can marry a good, kind, respectable gentleman, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had better
make up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind to it. They speak very well of you, sir, in the house,
and, if you will allow me to say so, I like your face. You have a very
different appearance from the late count, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wasn't five feet high. And
they say your fortune is beyond everything. There's no harm in that.
So I beseech you to be patient, sir, and bide your time. If I don't say
this to you, sir, perhaps no one will. Of course it is not for me to
make any promises. I can answer for nothing. But I think your chance is
not so bad, sir. I am nothing but a weary old woman in my quiet corner,
but one woman understands another, and I think I make out the countess.
I received her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) in my arms when she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) came into the world and her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) first
wedding day was the saddest of my life. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) owes it to me to show me
another and a brighter one. If you will hold firm, sir--and you look as
if you would--I think we may see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for your encouragement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman,
heartily. <div class="bookquote">``One can't have too much. I mean to hold firm. And if Madame
de Cintré marries me you must come and live with her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old woman looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strangely, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soft, lifeless eyes. <div class="bookquote">``It
may seem a heartless thing to say, sir, when one has been forty years in
a house, but I may tell you that I should like to leave this place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's just the time to say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, fervently. <div class="bookquote">``After
forty years one wants a change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, sir;''  (<font color='red'><b>faithful</b></font>)</div>and this faithful servant dropped another
curtsey and seemed disposed to retire. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lingered a moment and
gave a timid, joyless smile. Newman was disappointed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fingers
stole half shyly half irritably into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) informant
noticed the movement. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God I am not a Frenchwoman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If
I were, I would tell you with a brazen simper, old as I am, that if you
please, monsieur, my information is worth something. Let me tell you so
in my own decent English way. It _is_ worth something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much, please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Simply this: a promise not to hint to the countess that I have said
these things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that is all, you have it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all, sir. Thank you, sir. Good day, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>And having once
more slid down telescope-wise into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scanty petticoats, the old woman
departed. At the same moment Madame de Cintré came in by an opposite
door. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) noticed the movement of the other _portière_ and asked Newman
who had been entertaining him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The British female!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``An old lady in a black dress and a
cap, who curtsies up and down, and expresses herself ever so well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An old lady who curtsies and expresses herself?... Ah, you mean poor
Mrs. Bread. I happen to know that you have made a conquest of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cake, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ought to be called,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very sweet.
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a delicious old woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``What can she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have said to you?
She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is an excellent creature, but we think her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rather dismal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered presently, <div class="bookquote">``that I like her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has
lived near you so long. Since your birth, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, simply; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very faithful; I can trust
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had never made any reflections to this lady upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother and
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother Urbain; had given no hint of the impression they made upon
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). But, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had guessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed careful to
avoid all occasion for making him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) speak of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never alluded to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's domestic decrees; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never quoted the opinions of the
marquis. They had talked, however, of Valentin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had made no
secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) extreme affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) younger brother. Newman listened
sometimes with a certain harmless jealousy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have liked to
divert some of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tender allusions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own credit. Once Madame
de Cintré told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a little air of triumph about something that
Valentin had done which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) honor. It was a
service he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had rendered to an old friend of the family; something more
<div class="bookquote">``serious''  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div>than Valentin was usually supposed capable of being. Newman
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was glad to hear of it, and then began to talk about something
which lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own heart. Madame de Cintré listened, but after a
while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't like the way you speak of my brother Valentin.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Hereupon Newman, surprised, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) but
kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too kindly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``It is a kindness that costs
nothing; it is the kindness you show to a child. It is as if you didn't
respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)? Why I think I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think? If you are not sure, it is no respect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``If you do, I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If one loves a person, that is a question one is not bound to answer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should not have asked it of me, then. I am very fond of your
brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) amuses you. But you would not like to resemble him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't like to resemble anyone. It is hard enough work resembling
one's self.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``by resembling one's self?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, doing what is expected of one. Doing one's duty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is only when one is very good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, a great many people are good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Valentin is quite
good enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré was silent for a short time. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) is not good enough for
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would do something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) is very clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a proof of cleverness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``to be happy without doing
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think Valentin is happy, in reality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) is clever, generous,
brave; but what is there to show for it? To me there is something sad in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) life, and sometimes I have a sort of foreboding about him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). I don't
know why, but I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) will have some great trouble--perhaps an
unhappy end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, jovially. <div class="bookquote">``I will watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) and
keep harm away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>One evening, in Madame de Bellegarde's salon, the conversation had
flagged most sensibly. The marquis walked up and down in silence, like a
sentinel at the door of some smooth-fronted citadel of the proprieties;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mother sat staring at the fire; young Madame de Bellegarde worked at
an enormous band of tapestry. Usually there were three or four visitors,
but on this occasion a violent storm sufficiently accounted for the
absence of even the most devoted habitués. In the long silences the
howling of the wind and the beating of the rain were distinctly audible.
Newman sat perfectly still, watching the clock, determined to stay till
the stroke of eleven, but not a moment longer. Madame de Cintré had
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to the circle, and had been standing for some time
within the uplifted curtain of a window, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forehead against the
pane, gazing out into the deluged darkness. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned round
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sister-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For Heaven's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, with peculiar eagerness, <div class="bookquote">``go to the piano
and play something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde held up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tapestry and pointed to a little white
flower. <div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me to leave this. I am in the midst of a masterpiece.
My flower is going to smell very sweet; I am putting in the smell with
this gold-colored silk. I am holding my breath; I can't leave off. Play
something yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is absurd for me to play when you are present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Cintré. But the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to the piano and began to
strike the keys with vehemence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) played for some time, rapidly and
brilliantly; when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stopped, Newman went to the piano and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
to begin again. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, and, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) insisting, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I
have not been playing for you; I have been playing for myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went
back to the window again and looked out, and shortly afterwards left the
room. When Newman took leave, Urbain de Bellegarde accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) always did, just three steps down the staircase. At the bottom stood
a servant with his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) overcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had just put it on when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) saw Madame de
Cintré coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) across the vestibule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you be at home on Friday?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment before answering his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
like my mother and my brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said softly, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on the balustrade and prepared to ascend the stairs,
fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes on the first step.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall be at home on Friday,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed up the wide dusky
staircase.

<p/>On the Friday, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to please to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dislike your family?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``That has a horrid sound. I didn't
say so, did I? I didn't mean it, if I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me what you think of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think of any of them but you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because you dislike them. Speak the truth; you can't offend
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't exactly love your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I remember now.
But what is the use of my saying so? I had forgotten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too good-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré gravely. Then, as if
to avoid the appearance of inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to speak ill of the marquis, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
turned away, motioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to sit down.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remained standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and said presently, <div class="bookquote">``What is of much
more importance is that they don't like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--they don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you think they are wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked. <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe I
am a man to dislike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that a man who may be liked may also be disliked. And my
brother--my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``have not made you angry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sometimes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never shown it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, so much the better. They think they have treated you very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt they might have handled me much more roughly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to them. Honestly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are generous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``It's a disagreeable
position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For them, you mean. Not for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when their sins are forgiven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``They don't think I am
as good as they are. I do. But we shan't quarrel about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't even agree with you without saying something that has a
disagreeable sound. The presumption was against you. That you probably
don't understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman sat down and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for some time. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I really
understand it. But when you say it, I believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a poor reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's a very good one. You have a high spirit, a high standard; but
with you it's all natural and unaffected; you don't seem to have stuck
your head into a vise, as if you were sitting for the photograph of
propriety. You think of me as a fellow who has had no idea in life but
to make money and drive sharp bargains. That's a fair description of me,
but it is not the whole story. A man ought to care for something else,
though I don't know exactly what. I cared for money-making, but I never
cared particularly for the money. There was nothing else to do, and
it was impossible to be idle. I have been very easy to others, and to
myself. I have done most of the things that people asked me--I don't
mean rascals. As regards your mother and your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added,
<div class="bookquote">``there is only one point upon which I feel that I might quarrel with
them. I don't ask them to sing my praises to you, but I ask them to let
you alone. If I thought they talked ill of me to you, I should come down
upon them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have let me alone, as you say. They have not talked ill of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I declare they are only too good for this
world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré appeared to find something startling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
exclamation. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would, perhaps, have replied, but at this moment
the door was thrown open and Urbain de Bellegarde stepped across the
threshold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) appeared surprised at finding Newman, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) surprise
was but a momentary shadow across the surface of an unwonted joviality.
Newman had never seen the marquis so exhilarated; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pale, unlighted
countenance had a sort of thin transfiguration. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) held open the
door for someone else to enter, and presently appeared old Madame de
Bellegarde, leaning on the arm of a gentleman whom Newman had not seen
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had already risen, and Madame de Cintré rose, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) always
did before her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mother. The marquis, who had greeted Newman almost
genially, stood apart, slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mother came forward
with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave a majestic little nod at Newman, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) released the strange gentleman, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you an unknown relative, Lord
Deepmere. Lord Deepmere is our cousin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has done only to-day what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ought to have done long ago--come to make our acquaintance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré smiled, and offered Lord Deepmere her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``It is very
extraordinary,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said this noble laggard, <div class="bookquote">``but this is the first time
that I have ever been in Paris for more than three or four weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long have you been here now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, for the last two months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere.

<p/>These two remarks might have constituted an impertinence; but a glance
at Lord Deepmere's face would have satisfied you, as it apparently
satisfied Madame de Cintré, that they constituted only a _naïveté_. When
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) companions were seated, Newman, who was out of the conversation,
occupied himself with observing the newcomer. Observation, however,
as regards Lord Deepmere's person; had no great range. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) was a small,
meagre man, of some three and thirty years of age, with a bald head,
a short nose and no front teeth in the upper jaw; he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) had round, candid
blue eyes, and several pimples on his (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) chin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) was evidently very shy,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) laughed a great deal, catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) breath with an odd, startling
sound, as the most convenient imitation of repose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) physiognomy
denoted great simplicity, a certain amount of brutality, and probable
failure in the past to profit by rare educational advantages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>)
remarked that Paris was awfully jolly, but that for real, thorough-paced
entertainment it was nothing to Dublin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) even preferred Dublin to
London. Had Madame de Cintré ever been to Dublin? They must all come
over there some day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) would show them some Irish sport. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) always
went to Ireland for the fishing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) came to Paris for the new
Offenbach things. They always brought them out in Dublin, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>)
couldn't wait. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) had been nine times to hear La Pomme de Paris. Madame
de Cintré, leaning back, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) arms folded, looked at Lord Deepmere
with a more visibly puzzled face than she (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) usually showed to society.
Madame de Bellegarde, on the other hand, wore a fixed smile. The marquis
said that among light operas his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) favorite was the Gazza Ladra. The
marquise then began a series of inquiries about the duke and the
cardinal, the old countess and Lady Barbara, after listening to which,
and to Lord Deepmere's somewhat irreverent responses, for a quarter of
an hour, Newman rose to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave. The marquis went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) three
steps into the hall.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) Irish?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, nodding in the direction of the visitor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother was the daughter of Lord Finucane,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
has great Irish estates. Lady Bridget, in the complete absence of
male heirs, either direct or collateral--a most extraordinary
circumstance--came in for everything. But Lord Deepmere's title is
English and his (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) English property is immense. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) is a charming young
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman answered nothing, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) detained the marquis as the latter was
beginning gracefully to recede. <div class="bookquote">``It is a good time for me to thank you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``for sticking so punctiliously to our bargain, for doing so
much to help me on with your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis stared. <div class="bookquote">``Really, I have done nothing that I can boast of,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh don't be modest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I can't flatter myself
that I am doing so well simply by my own merit. And thank your mother
for me, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away, leaving M. de Bellegarde looking after
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XIV

<p/>The next time Newman came to the Rue de l’Université he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had the good
fortune to find Madame de Cintré alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come with a definite
intention, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lost no time in executing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wore, moreover, a
look which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eagerly interpreted as expectancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been coming to see you for six months, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I
have never spoken to you a second time of marriage. That was what you
asked me; I obeyed. Could any man have done better?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have acted with great delicacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm going to change now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that I am
going to be indelicate; but I'm going to go back to where I began. I
_am_ back there. I have been all round the circle. Or rather, I have
never been away from here. I have never ceased to want what I wanted
then. Only now I am more sure of it, if possible; I am more sure of
myself, and more sure of you. I know you better, though I don't know
anything I didn't believe three months ago. You are everything--you are
beyond everything--I can imagine or desire. You know me now; you _must_
know me. I won't say that you have seen the best--but you have seen the
worst. I hope you have been thinking all this while. You must have seen
that I was only waiting; you can't suppose that I was changing. What
will you say to me, now? Say that everything is clear and reasonable,
and that I have been very patient and considerate, and deserve my
reward. And then give me your hand. Madame de Cintré do that. Do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you were only waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I was very sure this day
would come. I have thought about it a great deal. At first I was half
afraid of it. But I am not afraid of it now.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) paused a moment, and
then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It's a relief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was sitting on a low chair, and Newman was on an ottoman, near her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned a little and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand, which for an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
keep. <div class="bookquote">``That means that I have not waited for nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eyes fill with tears. <div class="bookquote">``With
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``you will be as safe--as safe'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ardor
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hesitated a moment for a comparison--<div class="bookquote">``as safe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, with a kind
of simple solemnity, <div class="bookquote">``as in your father's arms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) tears increased. Then, abruptly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) face on the cushioned arm of the sofa beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) chair, and
broke into noiseless sobs. <div class="bookquote">``I am weak--I am weak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All the more reason why you should give yourself up to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
answered. <div class="bookquote">``Why are you troubled? There is nothing but happiness. Is that
so hard to believe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To you everything seems so simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``But
things are not so. I like you extremely. I liked you six months ago, and
now I am sure of it, as you say you are sure. But it is not easy, simply
for that, to decide to marry you. There are a great many things to think
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ought to be only one thing to think about--that we love each
other,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) remained silent he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) quickly added, <div class="bookquote">``Very
good, if you can't accept that, don't tell me so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be very glad to think of nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said at last; <div class="bookquote">``not to
think at all; only to shut both my eyes and give myself up. But I can't.
I'm cold, I'm old, I'm a coward; I never supposed I should marry again,
and it seems to me very strange I should ever have listened to you.
When I used to think, as a girl, of what I should do if I were to marry
freely, by my own choice, I thought of a very different man from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's nothing against me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman with an immense smile; <div class="bookquote">``your
taste was not formed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smile made Madame de Cintré smile. <div class="bookquote">``Have you formed it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked.
And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, in a different tone, <div class="bookquote">``Where do you wish to live?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anywhere in the wide world you like. We can easily settle that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why I ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) presently continued. <div class="bookquote">``I care very
little. I think if I were to marry you I could live almost anywhere.
You have some false ideas about me; you think that I need a great many
things--that I must have a brilliant, worldly life. I am sure you are
prepared to take a great deal of trouble to give me such things. But
that is very arbitrary; I have done nothing to prove that.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) paused
again, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mingled sound and silence were so sweet
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no wish to hurry her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have
had a wish to hurry a golden sunrise. <div class="bookquote">``Your being so different, which
at first seemed a difficulty, a trouble, began one day to seem to me a
pleasure, a great pleasure. I was glad you were different. And yet if I
had said so, no one would have understood me; I don't mean simply to my
family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They would have said I was a queer monster, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They would have said I could never be happy with you--you were too
different; and I would have said it was just _because_ you were so
different that I might be happy. But they would have given better
reasons than I. My only reason'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) paused again.

<p/>But this time, in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) golden sunrise, Newman felt the
impulse to grasp at a rosy cloud. <div class="bookquote">``Your only reason is that you love
me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) murmured with an eloquent gesture, and for want of a better
reason Madame de Cintré reconciled herself to this one.

<p/>Newman came back the next day, and in the vestibule, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) entered the
house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend Mrs. Bread. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was wandering about in
honorable idleness, and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) curtsies. Then turning to the servant who had admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, with the combined majesty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) native superiority and of
a rugged English accent, <div class="bookquote">``You may retire; I will have the honor of
conducting monsieur.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In spite of this combination, however, it appeared
to Newman that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) voice had a slight quaver, as if the tone of command
were not habitual to it. The man gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) an impertinent stare, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
walked slowly away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) led Newman upstairs. At half its course the
staircase gave a bend, forming a little platform. In the angle of
the wall stood an indifferent statue of an eighteenth-century nymph,
simpering, sallow, and cracked. Here Mrs. Bread stopped and looked with
shy kindness at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the good news, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a good right to be first to know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You have
taken such a friendly interest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread turned away and began to blow the dust off the statue, as if
this might be mockery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you want to congratulate me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am greatly
obliged.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``You gave me much pleasure the other day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) turned around, apparently reassured. <div class="bookquote">``You are not to think that I
have been told anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I have only guessed. But when I
looked at you, as you came in, I was sure I had guessed aright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very sharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure that in your quiet way you
see everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not a fool, sir, thank God. I have guessed something else beside,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I needn't tell you that, sir; I don't think you would believe it. At
any rate it wouldn't please you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me nothing but what will please me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>laughed Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That is
the way you began.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, I suppose you won't be vexed to hear that the sooner
everything is over the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sooner we are married, you mean? The better for me, certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The better for everyone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The better for you, perhaps. You know you are coming to live with us,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm extremely obliged to you, sir, but it is not of myself I was
thinking. I only wanted, if I might take the liberty, to recommend you
to lose no time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whom are you afraid of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread looked up the staircase and then down and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) looked at
the undusted nymph, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) possibly had sentient ears. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid
of everyone,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What an uncomfortable state of mind!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Does `everyone'
wish to prevent my marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of already having said too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread replied. <div class="bookquote">``I
won't take it back, but I won't say any more.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) way up
the staircase again and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) into Madame de Cintré's salon.

<p/>Newman indulged in a brief and silent imprecation when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found that
Madame de Cintré was not alone. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sat her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother, and in the
middle of the room stood young Madame de Bellegarde, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) bonnet and
mantle. The old marquise, who was leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) chair with a hand
clasping the knob of each arm, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) fixedly without moving.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) seemed barely conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) greeting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) appeared to be musing
intently. Newman said to himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) daughter had been announcing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) engagement and that the old lady found the morsel hard to swallow.
But Madame de Cintré, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) also a look by
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) appeared to mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should understand something. Was it
a warning or a request? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wish to enjoin speech or silence? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was puzzled, and young Madame de Bellegarde's pretty grin gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) no
information.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not told my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré abruptly, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Told me what?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>demanded the marquise. <div class="bookquote">``You tell me too little; you
should tell me everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Urbain</b></font>)</div>said Madame Urbain, with a little laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let _me_ tell your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>The old lady stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again, and then turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``You
are going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Oui, ma mère_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your daughter has consented, to my great happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when was this arrangement made?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I
seem to be picking up the news by chance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My suspense came to an end yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long was mine to have lasted?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) spoke without irritation; with a sort of cold, noble
displeasure.

<p/>Madame de Cintré stood silent, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on the ground. <div class="bookquote">``It is over
now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is my son--where is Urbain?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>asked the marquise. <div class="bookquote">``Send for your
brother and inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Madame de Bellegarde laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand on the bell-rope. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was to
make some visits with me, and I was to go and knock--very softly, very
softly--at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) study. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) can come to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pulled
the bell, and in a few moments Mrs. Bread appeared, with a face of calm
inquiry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send for your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>But Newman felt an irresistible impulse to speak, and to speak in a
certain way. <div class="bookquote">``Tell the marquis we want him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to Mrs. Bread, who
quietly retired.

<p/>Young Madame de Bellegarde went to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister-in-law and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned to Newman, with an intense smile. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is charming. I
congratulate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, with extreme
solemnity. <div class="bookquote">``My daughter is an extraordinarily good woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may have
faults, but I don't know them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother does not often make jokes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré; <div class="bookquote">``but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does they are terrible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is ravishing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquise</b></font>)</div>the Marquise Urbain resumed, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sister-in-law, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head on one side. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I congratulate you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré turned away, and, taking up a piece of tapestry,
began to ply the needle. Some minutes of silence elapsed, which were
interrupted by the arrival of M. de Bellegarde. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) came in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand, gloved, and was followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) brother Valentin, who
appeared to have just entered the house. M. de Bellegarde looked around
the circle and greeted Newman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) usual finely-measured courtesy.
Valentin saluted his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sisters, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) shook hands with
Newman, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a glance of acute interrogation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Arrivez donc, messieurs!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried young Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``We have
great news for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to your brother, my daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>Madame de Cintré had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tapestry. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes
to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">``I have accepted Mr. Newman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister has consented,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You see after all, I knew
what I was about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am charmed!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde, with superior benignity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So am I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin to Newman. <div class="bookquote">``The marquis and I are charmed. I
can't marry, myself, but I can understand it. I can't stand on my head,
but I can applaud a clever acrobat. My dear sister, I bless your union.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis stood looking for a while into the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``We
have been prepared,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last <div class="bookquote">``but it is inevitable that in face
of the event one should experience a certain emotion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave a
most unhilarious smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel no emotion that I was not perfectly prepared for,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't say that for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, smiling but differently from
the marquis. <div class="bookquote">``I am happier than I expected to be. I suppose it's the
sight of your happiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't exaggerate that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, getting up and
laying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's arm. <div class="bookquote">``You can't expect an honest old
woman to thank you for taking away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beautiful, only daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forgot me, dear madame,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the young marquise demurely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is very beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when is the wedding, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked young Madame de Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``I
must have a month to think over a dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be discussed,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we will discuss it, and let you know!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt we shall agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Urbain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't agree with Madame de Cintré, you will be very
unreasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Urbain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said young Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``I must go
straight to my tailor's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady had been standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter's arm,
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fixedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave a little sigh, and murmured, <div class="bookquote">``No, I did
_not_ expect it! You are a fortunate man,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, turning to Newman,
with an expressive nod.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I know that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I feel tremendously proud. I feel like
crying it on the housetops,--like stopping people in the street to tell
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde narrowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Pray don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The more people that know it, the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared. <div class="bookquote">``I haven't
yet announced it here, but I telegraphed it this morning to America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Telegraphed it to America?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To New York, to St. Louis, and to San Francisco; those are the
principal cities, you know. To-morrow I shall tell my friends here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you many?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Bellegarde, in a tone of which I am
afraid that Newman but partly measured the impertinence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough to bring me a great many hand-shakes and congratulations. To
say nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``of those I shall receive from your
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not use the telegraph,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
departure.

<p/>M. de Bellegarde, whose wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) imagination having apparently taken
flight to the tailor's, was fluttering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) silken wings in emulation,
shook hands with Newman, and said with a more persuasive accent than the
latter had ever heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) use, <div class="bookquote">``You may count upon me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife
led him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) away.

<p/>Valentin stood looking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sister to our hero. <div class="bookquote">``I hope you both
reflected seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said.

<p/>Madame de Cintré smiled. <div class="bookquote">``We have neither your powers of reflection nor
your depth of seriousness; but we have done our best.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have a great regard for each of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin continued. <div class="bookquote">``You
are charming young people. But I am not satisfied, on the whole, that
you belong to that small and superior class--that exquisite group
composed of persons who are worthy to remain unmarried. These are rare
souls; they are the salt of the earth. But I don't mean to be invidious;
the marrying people are often very nice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Valentin holds that women should marry, and that men should not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) arranges it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I arrange it by adoring you, my sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin ardently.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Adore someone whom you can marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I will arrange that
for you some day. I foresee that I am going to turn apostle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin was on the threshold; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) looked back a moment with a face
that had turned grave. <div class="bookquote">``I adore someone I can't marry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
dropped the _portière_ and departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They don't like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, standing alone before Madame de
Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, after a moment; <div class="bookquote">``they don't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now, do you mind that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, after another interval.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it. I should prefer that my mother were pleased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why the deuce,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>demanded Newman, <div class="bookquote">``is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not pleased? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave you
leave to marry me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true; I don't understand it. And yet I do `mind it,' as you say.
You will call it superstitious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will depend upon how much you let it bother you. Then I shall call
it an awful bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will keep it to myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``It shall not bother
you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>And then they talked of their marriage-day, and Madame de Cintré
assented unreservedly to Newman's desire to have it fixed for an early
date.

<p/>Newman's telegrams were answered with interest. Having dispatched but
three electric missives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) received no less than eight gratulatory
bulletins in return. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) put them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book, and the next time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) encountered old Madame de Bellegarde drew them forth and displayed
them to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). This, it must be confessed, was a slightly malicious
stroke; the reader must judge in what degree the offense was venial.
Newman knew that the marquise disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) telegrams, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could
see no sufficient reason for it. Madame de Cintré, on the other hand,
liked them, and, most of them being of a humorous cast, laughed at them
immoderately, and inquired into the character of their authors. Newman,
now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) prize was gained, felt a peculiar desire that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) triumph
should be manifest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) more than suspected that the Bellegardes were
keeping quiet about it, and allowing it, in their select circle, but a
limited resonance; and it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to think that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were to take
the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) phrased it, break all the windows. No man
likes being repudiated, and yet Newman, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not flattered, was
not exactly offended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not this good excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) somewhat
aggressive impulse to promulgate his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felicity; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sentiment was of
another quality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wanted for once to make the heads of the house of
Bellegarde _feel_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew not when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should have another chance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had had for the past six months a sense of the old lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son
looking straight over his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was now resolved that they should
toe a mark which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would give himself the satisfaction of drawing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is like seeing a bottle emptied when the wine is poured too slowly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said to Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``They make me want to joggle their elbows and
force them to spill their wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>To this Mrs. Tristram answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had better leave them alone
and let them do things in their own way. <div class="bookquote">``You must make allowances for
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``It is natural enough that they should hang fire a
little. They thought they accepted you when you made your application;
but they are not people of imagination, they could not project
themselves into the future, and now they will have to begin again. But
they _are_ people of honor, and they will do whatever is necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman spent a few moments in narrow-eyed meditation. <div class="bookquote">``I am not hard on
them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently said, <div class="bookquote">``and to prove it I will invite them all to a
festival.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a festival?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been laughing at my great gilded rooms all winter; I will show
you that they are good for something. I will give a party. What is the
grandest thing one can do here? I will hire all the great singers from
the opera, and all the first people from the Théâtre Français, and I
will give an entertainment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And whom will you invite?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You, first of all. And then the old lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son. And then everyone
among her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friends whom I have met at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house or elsewhere, everyone
who has shown me the minimum of politeness, every duke of them and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wife. And then all my friends, without exception: Miss Kitty Upjohn,
Miss Dora Finch, General Packard, C. P Hatch, and all the rest.
And everyone shall know what it is about, that is, to celebrate my
engagement to the Countess de Cintré. What do you think of the idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is odious!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram. And then in a moment: <div class="bookquote">``I
think it is delicious!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The very next evening Newman repaired to Madame de Bellegarde's salon,
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) children, and invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to honor
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) poor dwelling by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) presence on a certain evening a fortnight
distant.

<p/>The marquise stared a moment. <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``what do you
want to do to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To make you acquainted with a few people, and then to place you in a
very easy chair and ask you to listen to Madame Frezzolini's singing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean to give a concert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And to have a crowd of people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All my friends, and I hope some of yours and your daughter's. I want to
celebrate my engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed to Newman that Madame de Bellegarde turned pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) opened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fan, a fine old painted fan of the last century, and looked at the
picture, which represented a _fête champêtre_--a lady with a guitar,
singing, and a group of dancers round a garlanded Hermes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We go out so little,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>murmured the marquis, <div class="bookquote">``since my poor father's
death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But _my_ dear father is still alive, my friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``I
am only waiting for my invitation to accept it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) glanced with
amiable confidence at Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It will be magnificent; I am very sure of
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am sorry to say, to the discredit of Newman's gallantry, that this
lady's invitation was not then and there bestowed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was giving all his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
attention to the old marquise. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked up at last, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I can't
think of letting you offer me a fête,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``until I have offered
you one. We want to present you to our friends; we will invite them all.
We have it very much at heart. We must do things in order. Come to me
about the 25th; I will let you know the exact day immediately. We shall
not have anyone so fine as Madame Frezzolini, but we shall have some
very good people. After that you may talk of your own fête.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The old
lady spoke with a certain quick eagerness, smiling more agreeably as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
went on.

<p/>It seemed to Newman a handsome proposal, and such proposals always
touched the sources of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) good-nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to Madame de Bellegarde
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) should be glad to come on the 25th or any other day, and that it
mattered very little whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) friends at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house or at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
own. I have said that Newman was observant, but it must be admitted that
on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) failed to notice a certain delicate glance which
passed between Madame de Bellegarde and the marquis, and which we may
presume to have been a commentary upon the innocence displayed in that
latter clause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) speech.

<p/>Valentin de Bellegarde walked away with Newman that evening, and when
they had left the Rue de l’Université some distance behind them he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said
reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``My mother is very strong--very strong.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then in answer to
an interrogative movement of Newman's he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was driven to
the wall, but you would never have thought it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fête of the 25th was
an invention of the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no idea whatever of giving a fête,
but finding it the only issue from your proposal, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked straight
at the dose--excuse the expression--and bolted it, as you saw, without
winking. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is very strong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, divided between relish and compassion. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
care a straw for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fête, I am willing to take the will for the deed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, with a little inconsequent touch of family
pride. <div class="bookquote">``The thing will be done now, and done handsomely.''



 (<font color='red'><b>XV</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV

<p/>Valentin de Bellegarde's announcement of the secession of Mademoiselle
Nioche from her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) father's domicile and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) irreverent reflections upon
the attitude of this anxious parent in so grave a catastrophe, received
a practical commentary in the fact that M. Nioche was slow to seek
another interview with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) late pupil. It had cost Newman some disgust
to be forced to assent to Valentin's somewhat cynical interpretation of
the old man's philosophy, and, though circumstances seemed to indicate
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had not given himself up to a noble despair, Newman thought it
very possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might be suffering more keenly than was apparent. M.
Nioche had been in the habit of paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a respectful little visit
every two or three weeks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) absence might be a proof quite as much
of extreme depression as of a desire to conceal the success with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had patched up his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sorrow. Newman presently learned from Valentin
several details touching this new phase of Mademoiselle Noémie's career.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was remarkable,''  (<font color='red'><b>this observer</b></font>)</div>this unshrinking observer declared,
<div class="bookquote">``and the way she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has managed this performance proves it. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has had
other chances, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was resolved to take none but the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did
you the honor to think for a while that you might be such a chance. You
were not; so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gathered up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) patience and waited a while longer. At
last her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) occasion came along, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) move with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes wide
open. I am very sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no innocence to lose, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
respectability. Dubious little damsel as you thought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had kept
a firm hold of that; nothing could be proved against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was
determined not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reputation go till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) equivalent.
About her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) equivalent she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had high ideas. Apparently her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ideal has been
satisfied. It is fifty years old, bald-headed, and deaf, but it is very
easy about money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>this observer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And where in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, <div class="bookquote">``did you pick up this valuable
information?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In conversation. Remember my frivolous habits. In conversation with a
young woman engaged in the humble trade of glove-cleaner, who keeps a
small shop in the Rue St. Roch. M. Nioche lives in the same house, up
six pair of stairs, across the court, in and out of whose ill-swept
doorway Miss Noémie has been flitting for the last five years. The
little glove-cleaner was an old acquaintance; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) used to be the friend
of a friend of mine, who has married and dropped such friends. I often
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) society. As soon as I espied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clear little
window-pane, I recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I had on a spotlessly fresh pair of
gloves, but I went in and held up my hands, and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), `Dear
mademoiselle, what will you ask me for cleaning these?' `Dear count,'
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered immediately, `I will clean them for you for nothing.' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had instantly recognized me, and I had to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) history for the last
six years. But after that, I put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) upon that of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbors. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knows and admires Noémie, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told me what I have just repeated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>A month elapsed without M. Nioche reappearing, and Newman, who every
morning read two or three suicides in the _Figaro_, began to suspect
that, mortification proving stubborn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had sought a balm for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
wounded pride in the waters of the Seine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a note of M. Nioche's
address in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book, and finding himself one day in the
_quartier_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) determined, in so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might, to clear up his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
doubts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) repaired to the house in the Rue St. Roch which bore the
recorded number, and observed in a neighboring basement, behind a
dangling row of neatly inflated gloves, the attentive physiognomy of
Bellegarde's informant--a sallow person in a dressing-gown--peering into
the street as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were expecting that amiable nobleman to pass
again. But it was not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that Newman applied; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply asked of
the portress if M. Nioche were at home. The portress replied, as the
portress invariably replies, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lodger had gone out barely
three minutes before; but then, through the little square hole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
lodge-window taking the measure of Newman's fortunes, and seeing them,
by an unspecified process, refresh the dry places of servitude to
occupants of fifth floors on courts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added that M. Nioche would have
had just time to reach the Café de la Patrie, round the second corner
to the left, at which establishment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) regularly spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) afternoons.
Newman thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for the information, took the second turning to
the left, and arrived at the Café de la Patrie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt a momentary
hesitation to go in; was it not rather mean to <div class="bookquote">``follow up''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>poor old
Nioche at that rate? But there passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) vision an image of a
haggard little septuagenarian taking measured sips of a glass of sugar
and water and finding them quite impotent to sweeten his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) desolation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) opened the door and entered, perceiving nothing at first but a dense
cloud of tobacco smoke. Across this, however, in a corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently
descried the figure of M. Nioche, stirring the contents of a deep
glass, with a lady seated in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). The lady's back was turned
to Newman, but M. Nioche very soon perceived and recognized his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitor.
Newman had gone toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and the old man rose slowly, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
with a more blighted expression even than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are drinking hot punch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are not
dead. That's all right. Don't move.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche stood staring, with a fallen jaw, not daring to put out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand. The lady, who sat facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), turned round in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place
and glanced upward with a spirited toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head, displaying the
agreeable features of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at Newman sharply, to see
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), then--I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) discovered--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
said graciously, <div class="bookquote">``How d’ ye do, monsieur? won't you come into our little
corner?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you come--did you come after _me?_''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>asked M. Nioche very softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I went to your house to see what had become of you. I thought you might
be sick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very good of you, as always,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. <div class="bookquote">``No, I am not
well. Yes, I am _seek_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask monsieur to sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``Garçon, bring a
chair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you do us the honor to _seat?_''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, timorously, and
with a double foreignness of accent.

<p/>Newman said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had better see the thing out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took
a chair at the end of the table, with Mademoiselle Nioche on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) left
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father on the other side. <div class="bookquote">``You will take something, of course,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Noémie</b></font>)</div>said Miss Noémie, who was sipping a glass of madeira. Newman said that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) believed not, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) papa with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``What an
honor, eh? he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has come only for us.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>M. Nioche drained his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pungent
glass at a long draught, and looked out from eyes more lachrymose in
consequence. <div class="bookquote">``But you didn't come for me, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mademoiselle Noémie went
on. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't expect to find me here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman observed the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) appearance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) was very elegant
and prettier than before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) looked a year or two older, and it was
noticeable that, to the eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) had only gained in respectability.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) looked <div class="bookquote">``lady-like.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) was dressed in quiet colors, and wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>)
expensively unobtrusive toilet with a grace that might have come from
years of practice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) present self-possession and _aplomb_ struck
Newman as really infernal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) inclined to agree with Valentin de
Bellegarde that the young lady was very remarkable. <div class="bookquote">``No, to tell the
truth, I didn't come for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I didn't expect to find
you. I was told,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) added in a moment <div class="bookquote">``that you had left your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Quelle horreur!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried Mademoiselle Nioche with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Does one
leave one's father? You have the proof of the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, convincing proof,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman glancing at M. Nioche. The old man
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glance obliquely, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faded, deprecating eye, and then,
lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) empty glass, pretended to drink again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Noémie demanded. <div class="bookquote">``I know very well. It was M. de
Bellegarde. Why don't you say yes? You are not polite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am embarrassed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I set you a better example. I know M. de Bellegarde told you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) knows
a great deal about me--or he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) does. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) has taken a great deal
of trouble to find out, but half of it isn't true. In the first place,
I haven't left my father; I am much too fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Isn't it so, little
father? M. de Bellegarde is a charming young man; it is impossible to be
cleverer. I know a good deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) too; you can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) that when
you next see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with a sturdy grin; <div class="bookquote">``I won't carry any messages for
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div>said Mademoiselle Nioche, <div class="bookquote">``I don't depend upon
you, nor does M. de Bellegarde either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) is very much interested in me;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) can be left to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) own devices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) is a contrast to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) is a great contrast to me, I have no doubt''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But I
don't exactly know how you mean it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean it in this way. First of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) never offered to help me to a
_dot_ and a husband.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div>And Mademoiselle Nioche paused, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I won't
say that is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) favor, for I do you justice. What led you, by the
way, to make me such a queer offer? You didn't care for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have given me real pleasure to see you married to a
respectable young fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With six thousand francs of income!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Nioche</b></font>)</div>cried Mademoiselle Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``Do
you call that caring for me? I'm afraid you know little about women. You
were not _galant_; you were not what you might have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman flushed a trifle fiercely. <div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed <div class="bookquote">``that's rather
strong. I had no idea I had been so shabby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mademoiselle Nioche smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) muff. <div class="bookquote">``It is something, at
any rate, to have made you angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father had leaned both his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) elbows on the table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, bent
forward, was supported in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands, the thin white fingers of which
were pressed over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ears. In his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) position he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was staring fixedly at
the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) empty glass, and Newman supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not hearing.
Mademoiselle Noémie buttoned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) furred jacket and pushed back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
chair, casting a glance charged with the consciousness of an expensive
appearance first down over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) flounces and then up at Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better have remained an honest girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said quietly.

<p/>M. Nioche continued to stare at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glass, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
daughter got up, still bravely smiling. <div class="bookquote">``You mean that I look so much
like one? That's more than most women do nowadays. Don't judge me yet
awhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) added. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to succeed; that's what I mean to do. I
leave you; I don't mean to be seen in cafés, for one thing. I can't
think what you want of my poor father; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s very comfortable now. It
isn't his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fault, either. _Au revoir_, little father.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tapped the
old man on the head with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) muff. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) stopped a minute, looking
at Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Tell M. de Bellegarde, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wants news of me, to come
and get it from _me!_''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) turned and departed, the white-aproned
waiter, with a bow, holding the door wide open for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).

<p/>M. Nioche sat motionless, and Newman hardly knew what to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). The
old man looked dismally foolish. <div class="bookquote">``So you determined not to shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said presently.

<p/>M. Nioche, without moving, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a long, peculiar
look. It seemed to confess everything, and yet not to ask for pity, nor
to pretend, on the other hand, to a rugged ability to do without it. It
might have expressed the state of mind of an innocuous insect, flat
in shape and conscious of the impending pressure of a boot-sole, and
reflecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was perhaps too flat to be crushed. M. Nioche's gaze
was a profession of moral flatness. <div class="bookquote">``You despise me terribly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said,
in the weakest possible voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``it is none of my business. It's a good plan to
take things easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I made you too many fine speeches,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>M. Nioche added. <div class="bookquote">``I meant them at
the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I am very glad you didn't shoot her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I was
afraid you might have shot yourself. That is why I came to look you up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) began to button his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``You despise me, and I can't explain to you.
I hoped I shouldn't see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that's rather shabby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't drop your
friends that way. Besides, the last time you came to see me I thought
you particularly jolly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche musingly; <div class="bookquote">``I was in a fever. I didn't
know what I said, what I did. It was delirium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, you are quieter now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``As quiet as the grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whispered
softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very unhappy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forehead slowly, and even pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wig a
little, looking askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) empty glass. <div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes. But that's an old
story. I have always been unhappy. My daughter does what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will with
me. I take what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gives me, good or bad. I have no spirit, and when
you have no spirit you must keep quiet. I shan't trouble you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, rather disgusted at the smooth operation of the old
man's philosophy, <div class="bookquote">``that's as you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche seemed to have been prepared to be despised but nevertheless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made a feeble movement of appeal from Newman's faint praise. <div class="bookquote">``After
all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is my daughter, and I can still look after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). If
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will do wrong, why she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will. But there are many different
paths, there are degrees. I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the benefit--give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the
benefit'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and M. Nioche paused, staring vaguely at Newman, who began to
suspect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brain had softened--<div class="bookquote">``the benefit of my experience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman</b></font>)</div>M.
Nioche added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your experience?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>inquired Newman, both amused and amazed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My experience of business,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, gravely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``that will be a great advantage to
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said good-bye, and offered the poor, foolish old man
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand.

<p/>M. Nioche took it and leaned back against the wall, holding it a moment
and looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you think my wits are going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``Very likely; I have always a pain in my head. That's why I can't
explain, I can't tell you. And she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s so strong, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) makes me walk as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
will, anywhere! But there's this--there's this.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped, still
staring up at Newman. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) little white eyes expanded and glittered for a
moment like those of a cat in the dark. <div class="bookquote">``It's not as it seems. I haven't
forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). Oh, no!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right; don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s a bad case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's horrible, it's horrible,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche; <div class="bookquote">``but do you want to know
the truth? I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)! I take what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gives me, and I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
more. To-day she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) brought me three hundred francs; they are here in my
waistcoat pocket. Now I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) almost cruelly. No, I haven't forgiven
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you accept the money?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I hadn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>said M. Nioche, <div class="bookquote">``I should have hated her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) still more.
That's what misery is. No, I haven't forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing again. And with
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed along the glazed side of the café,
on reaching the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw the old man motioning the waiter, with a
melancholy gesture, to replenish his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glass.

<p/>One day, a week after his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visit to the Café de la Patrie, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) called upon
Valentin de Bellegarde, and by good fortune found him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at home. Newman
spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) interview with M. Nioche and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was afraid Valentin had judged the old man correctly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had found the
couple hobnobbing together in all amity; the old gentleman's rigor was
purely theoretic. Newman confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was disappointed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should
have expected to see M. Nioche take high ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``High ground, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``there is
no high ground for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to take. The only perceptible eminence in M.
Nioche's horizon is Montmartre, which is not an edifying quarter. You
can't go mountaineering in a flat country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) remarked, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) has not forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). But
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'ll never find it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must do him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) the justice to suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) doesn't like the thing,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Nioche is like the great artists whose
biographies we read, who at the beginning of their career have
suffered opposition in the domestic circle. Their vocation has not
been recognized by their families, but the world has done it justice.
Mademoiselle Nioche has a vocation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``you take the little baggage too
seriously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know I do; but when one has nothing to think about, one must think of
little baggages. I suppose it is better to be serious about light things
than not to be serious at all. This little baggage entertains me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) has discovered that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) knows you have been hunting her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) up
and asking questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is very much tickled by it. That's
rather annoying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Annoying, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>laughed Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``not the least!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hanged if I should want to have a greedy little adventuress like that
know I was giving myself such pains about her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty woman is always worth one's pains,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>objected Valentin.
<div class="bookquote">``Mademoiselle Nioche is welcome to be tickled by my curiosity, and to
know that I am tickled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is tickled. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is not so much tickled,
by the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) gave me a
message for you of some such drift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless your quiet imagination,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``I have been to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>)--three times in five days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is a charming hostess; we talk of
Shakespeare and the musical glasses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is extremely clever and a very
curious type; not at all coarse or wanting to be coarse; determined not
to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) means to take very good care of herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is extremely
perfect; she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is as hard and clear-cut as some little figure of a
sea-nymph in an antique intaglio, and I will warrant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) has not
a grain more of sentiment or heart than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) was scooped out of a
big amethyst. You can't scratch her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) even with a diamond.
Extremely pretty,--really, when you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is wonderfully
pretty,--intelligent, determined, ambitious, unscrupulous, capable of
looking at a man strangled without changing color, she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is upon my honor,
extremely entertaining.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fine list of attractions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; ``they would serve as a
police-detective's description of a favorite criminal. I should sum them
up by another word than `entertaining.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that is just the word to use. I don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) is laudable or
lovable. I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) as my wife or my sister. But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a
very curious and ingenious piece of machinery; I like to see it in
operation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I have seen some very curious machines too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``and
once, in a needle factory, I saw a gentleman from the city, who had
stopped too near one of them, picked up as neatly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been
prodded by a fork, swallowed down straight, and ground into small
pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Re-entering his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) domicile, late in the evening, three days after
Madame de Bellegarde had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) bargain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)--the expression is
sufficiently correct--touching the entertainment at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was
to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) found on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) table a card of goodly
dimensions bearing an announcement that this lady would be at home on
the 27th of the month, at ten o’clock in the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) stuck it into
the frame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mirror and eyed it with some complacency; it seemed
an agreeable emblem of triumph, documentary evidence that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) prize was
gained. Stretched out in a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was looking at it lovingly, when
Valentin de Bellegarde was shown into the room. Valentin's glance
presently followed the direction of Newman's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perceived his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
mother's invitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have they put into the corner?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked. ``Not the customary
`music,' `dancing,' or _`tableaux vivants'?_ They ought at least to put
`An American.'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there are to be several of us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Tristram told me
to-day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had received a card and sent an acceptance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, then, with Mrs. Tristram and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband you will have support. My
mother might have put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) card `Three Americans.' But I suspect you
will not lack amusement. You will see a great many of the best people in
France. I mean the long pedigrees and the high noses, and all that. Some
of them are awful idiots; I advise you to take them up cautiously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I guess I shall like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am prepared to like
every one and everything in these days; I am in high good-humor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment in silence and then dropped himself into
a chair with an unwonted air of weariness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy man!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't become
offensive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If anyone chooses to take offense, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may. I have a good conscience,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are really in love with my sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, after a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) also?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) likes me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the witchcraft you have used?''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin asked. <div class="bookquote">``How do _you_
make love?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I haven't any general rules,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``In any way that seems
acceptable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect that, if one knew it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``you are a
terrible customer. You walk in seven-league boots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something the matter with you to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said in
response to this. <div class="bookquote">``You are vicious. Spare me all discordant sounds until
after my marriage. Then, when I have settled down for life, I shall be
better able to take things as they come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And when does your marriage take place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About six weeks hence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin was silent a while, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``And you feel very
confident about the future?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confident. I knew what I wanted, exactly, and I know what I have got.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure you are going to be happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``So foolish a question deserves a foolish answer.
Yes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not afraid of anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What should I be afraid of? You can't hurt me unless you kill me by
some violent means. That I should indeed consider a tremendous sell.
I want to live and I mean to live. I can't die of illness, I am too
ridiculously tough; and the time for dying of old age won't come round
yet a while. I can't lose my wife, I shall take too good care of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). I
may lose my money, or a large part of it; but that won't matter, for I
shall make twice as much again. So what have I to be afraid of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not afraid it may be rather a mistake for an American man of
business to marry a French countess?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For the countess, possibly; but not for the man of business, if you
mean me! But my countess shall not be disappointed; I answer for
her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt the impulse to celebrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) happy
certitude by a bonfire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up to throw a couple of logs upon the
already blazing hearth. Valentin watched for a few moments the quickened
flame, and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand, gave a melancholy
sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Got a headache?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Je suis triste_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, with Gallic simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sad, eh? It is about the lady you said the other night that you
adored and that you couldn't marry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I really say that? It seemed to me afterwards that the words had
escaped me. Before Claire it was bad taste. But I felt gloomy as I
spoke, and I feel gloomy still. Why did you ever introduce me to that
girl?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's Noémie, is it? Lord deliver us! You don't mean to say you are
lovesick about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lovesick, no; it's not a grand passion. But the cold-blooded little
demon sticks in my thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has bitten me with those even little
teeth of hers; I feel as if I might turn rabid and do something crazy
in consequence. It's very low, it's disgustingly low. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s the most
mercenary little jade in Europe. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) really affects my peace of
mind; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is always running in my head. It's a striking contrast to your
noble and virtuous attachment--a vile contrast! It is rather pitiful
that it should be the best I am able to do for myself at my present
respectable age. I am a nice young man, eh, _en somme?_ You can't
warrant my future, as you do your own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Drop that girl, short,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``don't go near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again, and your
future will do. Come over to America and I will get you a place in a
bank.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is easy to say drop her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, with a light laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You
can't drop a pretty woman like that. One must be polite, even with
Noémie. Besides, I'll not have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suppose I am afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So, between politeness and vanity, you will get deeper into the mud?
Keep them both for something better. Remember, too, that I didn't want

about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't reproach you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid! I wouldn't
for the world have missed knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is really extraordinary. The
way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has already spread her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wings is amazing. I don't know when a
woman has amused me more. But excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) added in an instant; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
doesn't amuse you, at second hand, and the subject is an impure one.
Let us talk of something else.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Valentin introduced another topic, but
within five minutes Newman observed that, by a bold transition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
reverted to Mademoiselle Nioche, and was giving pictures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) manners
and quoting specimens of her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) _mots_. These were very witty, and, for
a young woman who six months before had been painting the most artless
madonnas, startlingly cynical. But at last, abruptly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped, became
thoughtful, and for some time afterwards said nothing. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rose to
go it was evident that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts were still running upon Mademoiselle
Nioche. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a frightful little monster!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI

<p/>The next ten days were the happiest that Newman had ever known. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
saw Madame de Cintré every day, and never saw either old Madame de
Bellegarde or the elder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) prospective brothers-in-law. Madame de
Cintré at last seemed to think it becoming to apologize for their never
being present. <div class="bookquote">``They are much taken up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with doing the
honors of Paris to Lord Deepmere.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a smile in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gravity
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made this declaration, and it deepened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is our
seventh cousin, you know, and blood is thicker than water. And then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
is so interesting!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And with this she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) laughed.

<p/>Newman met young Madame de Bellegarde two or three times, always roaming
about with graceful vagueness, as if in search of an unattainable ideal
of amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) always reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of a painted perfume-bottle with a
crack in it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had grown to have a kindly feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), based
on the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) owing conjugal allegiance to Urbain de Bellegarde.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) pitied M. de Bellegarde's wife, especially since she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a silly,
thirstily-smiling little brunette, with a suggestion of an unregulated
heart. The small marquise sometimes looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) with an intensity
too marked not to be innocent, for coquetry is more finely shaded.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) apparently wanted to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) something or tell him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) something; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>)
wondered what it was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) was shy of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) an opportunity,
because, if her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) communication bore upon the aridity of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) matrimonial
lot, he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) was at a loss to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) could help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) had a fancy,
however, of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) some day and saying -LRB-after looking
around behind her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)-RRB- with a little passionate hiss, <div class="bookquote">``I know you detest my
husband; let me have the pleasure of assuring you for once that you
are right. Pity a poor woman who is married to a clock-image in
_papier-mâché!_''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Possessing, however, in default of a competent
knowledge of the principles of etiquette, a very downright sense of
the <div class="bookquote">``meanness''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>of certain actions, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) to belong to his (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>)
position to keep on his (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) guard; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) was not going to put it into the
power of these people to say that in their house he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) had done anything
unpleasant. As it was, Madame de Bellegarde used to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) news of the
dress she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) meant to wear at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wedding, and which had not yet, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
creative imagination, in spite of many interviews with the tailor,
resolved itself into its composite totality. <div class="bookquote">``I told you pale blue bows
on the sleeves, at the elbows,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But to-day I don't see my
blue bows at all. I don't know what has become of them. To-day I see
pink--a tender pink. And then I pass through strange, dull phases in
which neither blue nor pink says anything to me. And yet I must have the
bows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have them green or yellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Malheureux!_''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>the little marquise would cry. <div class="bookquote">``Green bows would break
your marriage--your children would be illegitimate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré was calmly happy before the world, and Newman had the
felicity of fancying that before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), when the world was absent, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
was almost agitatedly happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said very tender things. <div class="bookquote">``I take no
pleasure in you. You never give me a chance to scold you, to correct
you. I bargained for that, I expected to enjoy it. But you won't do
anything dreadful; you are dismally inoffensive. It is very stupid;
there is no excitement for me; I might as well be marrying someone
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it's the worst I can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman would say in answer to
this. <div class="bookquote">``Kindly overlook the deficiency.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), at
least, would never scold her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was perfectly satisfactory. <div class="bookquote">``If you
only knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how exactly you are what I coveted! And I am
beginning to understand why I coveted it; the having it makes all the
difference that I expected. Never was a man so pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good
fortune. You have been holding your head for a week past just as I
wanted my wife to hold hers. You say just the things I want her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to say.
You walk about the room just as I want her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to walk. You have just the
taste in dress that I want her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to have. In short, you come up to the
mark, and, I can tell you, my mark was high.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These observations seemed to make Madame de Cintré rather grave. At last
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, I don't come up to the mark; your mark is too
high. I am not all that you suppose; I am a much smaller affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
is a magnificent woman, your ideal. Pray, how did she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) come to such
perfection?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was never anything else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Cintré went on, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is better than
my own ideal. Do you know that is a very handsome compliment? Well, sir,
I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) my own!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram came to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) dear Claire after Newman had announced his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
engagement, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told our hero the next day that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) good fortune was
simply absurd. <div class="bookquote">``For the ridiculous part of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that you
are evidently going to be as happy as if you were marrying Miss Smith
or Miss Thompson. I call it a brilliant match for you, but you get
brilliancy without paying any tax upon it. Those things are usually a
compromise, but here you have everything, and nothing crowds anything
else out. You will be brilliantly happy as well.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Newman thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) pleasant, encouraging way of saying things; no woman could encourage
or discourage better. Tristram's way of saying things was different; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had been taken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife to call upon Madame de Cintré, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) gave an
account of the expedition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't catch me giving an opinion on your countess this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``I put my foot in it once. That's a d--d underhand thing to do, by
the way--coming round to sound a fellow upon the woman you are going to
marry. You deserve anything you get. Then of course you rush and tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) takes care to make it pleasant for the poor spiteful wretch
the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) calls. I will do you the justice to say, however,
that you don't seem to have told Madame de Cintré; or if you have, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s
uncommonly magnanimous. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very nice; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tremendously polite.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Lizzie sat on the sofa, pressing each other's hands and calling
each other _chère belle_, and Madame de Cintré sent me with every third
word a magnificent smile, as if to give me to understand that I too was
a handsome dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quite made up for past neglect, I assure you; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was very pleasant and sociable. Only in an evil hour it came into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
head to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must present us to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother wished
to know your friends. I didn't want to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, and I was on the
point of telling Lizzie to go in alone and let me wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) outside.
But Lizzie, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) usual infernal ingenuity, guessed my purpose and
reduced me by a glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) eye. So they marched off arm in arm, and
I followed as I could. We found the old lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) armchair, twiddling
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aristocratic thumbs. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked at Lizzie from head to foot; but at
that game Lizzie, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) justice, was a match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>). My wife told
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) we were great friends of Mr. Newman. The marquise started a moment,
and then said, `Oh, Mr. Newman! My daughter has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind to
marry a Mr. Newman.' Then Madame de Cintré began to fondle Lizzie again,
and said it was this dear lady that had planned the match and
brought them together. `Oh, `tis you I have to thank for my American
son-in-law,' the old lady said to Mrs. Tristram. `It was a very clever
thought of yours. Be sure of my gratitude.' And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) began to look
at me and presently said, `Pray, are you engaged in some species of
manufacture?' I wanted to say that I manufactured broom-sticks for old
witches to ride on, but Lizzie got in ahead of me. `My husband, Madame
la Marquise,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) said, `belongs to that unfortunate class of persons
who have no profession and no business, and do very little good in
the world.' To get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) poke at the old woman she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) didn't care where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>)
shoved me. `Dear me,' said the marquise, `we all have our duties.' `I am
sorry mine compel me to take leave of you,' said Lizzie. And we bundled
out again. But you have a mother-in-law, in all the force of the term.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``my mother-in-law desires nothing better than to let
me alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Betimes, on the evening of the 27th, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to Madame de Bellegarde's
ball. The old house in the Rue de l’Université looked strangely
brilliant. In the circle of light projected from the outer gate a
detachment of the populace stood watching the carriages roll in; the
court was illumined with flaring torches and the portico carpeted with
crimson. When Newman arrived there were but a few people present. The
marquise and her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) two daughters were at the top of the staircase, where
the sallow old nymph in the angle peeped out from a bower of plants.
Madame de Bellegarde, in purple and fine laces, looked like an old lady
painted by Vandyke; Madame de Cintré was dressed in white. The old lady
greeted Newman with majestic formality, and looking round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), called
several of the persons who were standing near. They were elderly
gentlemen, of what Valentin de Bellegarde had designated as the
high-nosed category; two or three of them wore cordons and stars. They
approached with measured alertness, and the marquise said that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
wished to present them to Mr. Newman, who was going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
daughter. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) introduced successively three dukes, three counts,
and a baron. These gentlemen bowed and smiled most agreeably, and Newman
indulged in a series of impartial hand-shakes, accompanied by a <div class="bookquote">``Happy
to make your acquaintance, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at Madame de Cintré, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was not looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). If his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) personal self-consciousness had been of
a nature to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) constantly refer to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as the critic before whom,
in company, he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) played his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) might have found it a flattering
proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) confidence that he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) never caught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes resting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>).
It is a reflection Newman did not make, but we nevertheless risk it,
that in spite of this circumstance she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) probably saw every movement
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) little finger. Young Madame de Bellegarde was dressed in an
audacious toilet of crimson crape, bestrewn with huge silver moons--thin
crescent and full disks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't say anything about my dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``as if I were looking at you through a telescope.
It is very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is strange it matches the occasion. But I am not a heavenly
body.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw the sky at midnight that particular shade of crimson,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is my originality; anyone could have chosen blue. My sister-in-law
would have chosen a lovely shade of blue, with a dozen little delicate
moons. But I think crimson is much more amusing. And I give my idea,
which is moonshine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Moonshine and bloodshed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A murder by moonlight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>laughed Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``What a delicious
idea for a toilet! To make it complete, there is the silver dagger, you
see, stuck into my hair. But here comes Lord Deepmere,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added in a
moment. <div class="bookquote">``I must find out what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thinks of it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div>Lord Deepmere came up,
looking very red in the face, and laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Lord Deepmere can't decide
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prefers, my sister-in-law or me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) likes Claire because she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cousin, and me because I am not.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has no right to make love to Claire, whereas I am perfectly
_disponible_. It is very wrong to make love to a woman who is engaged,
but it is very wrong not to make love to a woman who is married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's very jolly making love to married women,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere,
<div class="bookquote">``because they can't ask you to marry them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that what the others do, the spinsters?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman inquired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere; <div class="bookquote">``in England all the girls ask a
fellow to marry them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a fellow brutally refuses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, really, you know, a fellow can't marry any girl that asks him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) lordship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your cousin won't ask you. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is going to marry Mr. Newman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's a very different thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>laughed Lord Deepmere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have accepted _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_, I suppose. That makes me hope that after
all you prefer me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, when things are nice I never prefer one to the other,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Englishman</b></font>)</div>said the
young Englishman. <div class="bookquote">``I take them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what a horror! I won't be taken in that way; I must be kept apart,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Newman is much better; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knows how
to choose. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chooses as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were threading a needle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) prefers
Madame de Cintré to any conceivable creature or thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can't help my being her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere to
Newman, with candid hilarity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I can't help that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing back; <div class="bookquote">``neither can
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you can't help my dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere, with
sturdy simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could prevent that only by dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``But unfortunately I don't know how to dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you may dance without knowing how; may you not, milord?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said
Madame de Bellegarde. But to this Lord Deepmere replied that a fellow
ought to know how to dance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) didn't want to make an ass of himself;
and at this moment Urbain de Bellegarde joined the group, slow-stepping
and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a very splendid entertainment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``The
old house looks very bright.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If _you_ are pleased, we are content,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
shoulders and bending them forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I suspect everyone is pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``How can they help
being pleased when the first thing they see as they come in is your
sister, standing there as beautiful as an angel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is very beautiful,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>rejoined the marquis, solemnly. <div class="bookquote">``But that
is not so great a source of satisfaction to other people, naturally, as
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am satisfied, marquis, I am satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
protracted enunciation. <div class="bookquote">``And now tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, looking round, <div class="bookquote">``who
some of your friends are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) in silence, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head bent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
hand raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) lower lip, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) slowly rubbed. A stream of people
had been pouring into the salon in which Newman stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) host,
the rooms were filling up and the spectacle had become brilliant. It
borrowed its splendor chiefly from the shining shoulders and profuse
jewels of the women, and from the voluminous elegance of their dresses.
There were no uniforms, as Madame de Bellegarde's door was inexorably
closed against the myrmidons of the upstart power which then ruled the
fortunes of France, and the great company of smiling and chattering
faces was not graced by any very frequent suggestions of harmonious
beauty. It is a pity, nevertheless, that Newman had not been a
physiognomist, for a great many of the faces were irregularly agreeable,
expressive, and suggestive. If the occasion had been different they
would hardly have pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have thought the women not
pretty enough and the men too smirking; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was now in a humor to
receive none but agreeable impressions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked no more narrowly
than to perceive that everyone was brilliant, and to feel that the sun
of their brilliancy was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) credit. <div class="bookquote">``I will present you to
some people,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde after a while. <div class="bookquote">``I will make a point
of it, in fact. You will allow me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will shake hands with anyone you want,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother
just introduced me to half a dozen old gentlemen. Take care you don't
pick up the same parties again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are the gentlemen to whom my mother presented you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I forgot them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``The people here
look very much alike.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect they have not forgotten you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) began
to walk through the rooms. Newman, to keep near him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the crowd, took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm; after which for some time, the marquis walked straight
along, in silence. At last, reaching the farther end of the suite of
reception-rooms, Newman found himself in the presence of a lady of
monstrous proportions, seated in a very capacious armchair, with several
persons standing in a semicircle round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). This little group had
divided as the marquis came up, and M. de Bellegarde stepped forward and
stood for an instant silent and obsequious, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hat raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
lips, as Newman had seen some gentlemen stand in churches as soon as
they entered their pews. The lady, indeed, bore a very fair likeness to
a reverend effigy in some idolatrous shrine. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was monumentally stout
and imperturbably serene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aspect was to Newman almost formidable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had a troubled consciousness of a triple chin, a small piercing eye, a
vast expanse of uncovered bosom, a nodding and twinkling tiara of plumes
and gems, and an immense circumference of satin petticoat. With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
little circle of beholders this remarkable woman reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of the Fat
Lady at a fair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) small, unwinking eyes at the new-comers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, <div class="bookquote">``let me present you our good friend
Mr. Newman, of whom you have heard us speak. Wishing to make Mr. Newman
known to those who are dear to us, I could not possibly fail to begin
with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Charmed, dear friend; charmed, monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess in a voice
which, though small and shrill, was not disagreeable, while Newman
executed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) obeisance. <div class="bookquote">``I came on purpose to see monsieur. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
appreciates the compliment. You have only to look at me to do so, sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) continued, sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) person with a much-encompassing glance.
Newman hardly knew what to say, though it seemed that to a duchess who
joked about her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) corpulence one might say almost anything. On hearing
that the duchess had come on purpose to see Newman, the gentlemen
who surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) turned a little and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with sympathetic
curiosity. The marquis with supernatural gravity mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) the
name of each, while the gentleman who bore it bowed; they were all what
are called in France _beaux noms_. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted extremely to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>the
duchess went on. <div class="bookquote">``_C’est positif_. In the first place, I am very fond of
the person you are going to marry; she (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is the most charming creature in
France. Mind you treat her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) well, or you shall hear some news of me. But
you look as if you were good. I am told you are very remarkable. I have
heard all sorts of extraordinary things about you. _Voyons_, are they
true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you can have heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you have your _légende_. We have heard that you have had a career
the most checkered, the most _bizarre_. What is that about your having
founded a city some ten years ago in the great West, a city which
contains to-day half a million of inhabitants? Isn't it half a million,
messieurs? You are exclusive proprietor of this flourishing settlement,
and are consequently fabulously rich, and you would be richer still if
you didn't grant lands and houses free of rent to all new-comers who
will pledge themselves never to smoke cigars. At this game, in three
years, we are told, you are going to be made president of America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>The duchess recited this amazing <div class="bookquote">``legend''  (<font color='red'><b>The duchess</b></font>)</div>with a smooth self-possession
which gave the speech to Newman's mind, the air of being a bit of
amusing dialogue in a play, delivered by a veteran comic actress. Before
she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) had ceased speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) had burst into loud, irrepressible laughter.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear duchess, dear duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>the marquis began to murmur, soothingly.
Two or three persons came to the door of the room to see who was
laughing at the duchess. But the lady continued with the soft, serene
assurance of a person who, as a duchess, was certain of being listened
to, and, as a garrulous woman, was independent of the pulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
auditors. <div class="bookquote">``But I know you are very remarkable. You must be, to have
endeared yourself to this good marquis and to his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) admirable world. They
are very exacting. I myself am not very sure at this hour of really
possessing it. Eh, Bellegarde? To please you, I see, one must be an
American millionaire. But your real triumph, my dear sir, is pleasing
the countess; she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is as difficult as a princess in a fairy tale. Your
success is a miracle. What is your secret? I don't ask you to reveal it
before all these gentlemen, but come and see me some day and give me a
specimen of your talents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The secret is with Madame de Cintré,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You must ask her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)
for it. It consists in her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) having a great deal of charity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very pretty!''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess. <div class="bookquote">``That's a very nice specimen, to begin
with. What, Bellegarde, are you already taking monsieur away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a duty to perform, dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, pointing to
the other groups.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, for you I know what that means. Well, I have seen monsieur; that
is what I wanted. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) can't persuade me that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) isn't very clever.
Farewell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>As Newman passed on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) host, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked who the duchess was. <div class="bookquote">``The
greatest lady in France,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis. M. de Bellegarde then
presented his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) prospective brother-in-law to some twenty other persons of
both sexes, selected apparently for their typically august character.
In some cases this character was written in good round hand upon the
countenance of the wearer; in others Newman was thankful for such help
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion's impressively brief intimation contributed to the
discovery of it. There were large, majestic men, and small demonstrative
men; there were ugly ladies in yellow lace and quaint jewels, and pretty
ladies with white shoulders from which jewels and everything else
were absent. Everyone gave Newman extreme attention, everyone smiled,
everyone was charmed to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) acquaintance, everyone looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
with that soft hardness of good society which puts out its hand but
keeps its fingers closed over the coin. If the marquis was going about
as a bear-leader, if the fiction of Beauty and the Beast was supposed
to have found its companion-piece, the general impression appeared to
be that the bear was a very fair imitation of humanity. Newman found his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
reception among the marquis's friends very <div class="bookquote">``pleasant;''  (<font color='red'><b>marquis friends</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could not have
said more for it. It was pleasant to be treated with so much explicit
politeness; it was pleasant to hear neatly turned civilities, with a
flavor of wit, uttered from beneath carefully-shaped moustaches; it was
pleasant to see clever Frenchwomen--they all seemed clever--turn their
backs to their partners to get a good look at the strange American whom
Claire de Cintré was to marry, and reward the object of the exhibition
with a charming smile. At last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away from a battery of
smiles and other amenities, Newman caught the eye of the marquis looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heavily; and thereupon, for a single instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) checked himself.
<div class="bookquote">``Am I behaving like a d--d fool?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked himself. <div class="bookquote">``Am I stepping
about like a terrier on his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) hind legs?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perceived
Mrs. Tristram at the other side of the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand in
farewell to M. de Bellegarde and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) way toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I holding my head too high?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Do I look as if I had the
lower end of a pulley fastened to my chin?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look like all happy men, very ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram.
<div class="bookquote">``It's the usual thing, neither better nor worse. I have been watching
you for the last ten minutes, and I have been watching M. de Bellegarde.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) doesn't like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more credit to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) for putting it through,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>replied Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But I
shall be generous. I shan't trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) any more. But I am very happy.
I can't stand still here. Please to take my arm and we will go for a
walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) led Mrs. Tristram through all the rooms. There were a great many of
them, and, decorated for the occasion and filled with a stately crowd,
their somewhat tarnished nobleness recovered its lustre. Mrs. Tristram,
looking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), dropped a series of softly-incisive comments upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
fellow-guests. But Newman made vague answers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hardly heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
thoughts were elsewhere. They were lost in a cheerful sense of success,
of attainment and victory. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) momentary care as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked
like a fool passed away, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply with a rich contentment.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had got what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wanted. The savor of success had always been highly
agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fortune to know it often. But it
had never before been so sweet, been associated with so much that was
brilliant and suggestive and entertaining. The lights, the flowers, the
music, the crowd, the splendid women, the jewels, the strangeness even
of the universal murmur of a clever foreign tongue were all a vivid
symbol and assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) having grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) purpose and forced along
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) groove. If Newman's smile was larger than usual, it was not tickled
vanity that pulled the strings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no wish to be shown with the
finger or to achieve a personal success. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could have looked down at
the scene, invisible, from a hole in the roof, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have enjoyed it
quite as much. It would have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own prosperity and
deepened that easy feeling about life to which, sooner or later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made
all experience contribute. Just now the cup seemed full.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very pretty party,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, after they had walked
a while. <div class="bookquote">``I have seen nothing objectionable except my husband leaning
against the wall and talking to an individual whom I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) takes
for a duke, but whom I more than suspect to be the functionary who
attends to the lamps. Do you think you could separate them? Knock over a
lamp!''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I doubt whether Newman, who saw no harm in Tristram's conversing with an
ingenious mechanic, would have complied with this request; but at this
moment Valentin de Bellegarde drew near. Newman, some weeks previously,
had presented Madame de Cintré's youngest brother to Mrs. Tristram, for
whose merits Valentin professed a discriminating relish and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
had paid several visits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever read Keats's Belle Dame sans Merci?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Tristram.
``You remind me of the hero of the ballad:--


<p/>`Oh, what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,
Alone and palely loitering?'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I am alone, it is because I have been deprived of your society,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Besides it is good manners for no man except Newman to
look happy. This is all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) address. It is not for you and me to go
before the curtain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You promised me last spring,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman to Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``that six
months from that time I should get into a monstrous rage. It seems to
me the time's up, and yet the nearest I can come to doing anything rough
now is to offer you a _café glacé_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you we should do things grandly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I don't allude
to the _cafés glacés_. But everyone is here, and my sister told me just
now that Urbain had been adorable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)'s a good fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)'s a good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) as a
brother. That reminds me that I ought to go and say something polite to
your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it be something very polite indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``It may be the
last time you will feel so much like it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman walked away, almost disposed to clasp old Madame de Bellegarde
round the waist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed through several rooms and at last found
the old marquise in the first saloon, seated on a sofa, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) young
kinsman, Lord Deepmere, beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). The young man looked somewhat bored;
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands were thrust into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were fixed upon the
toes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet being thrust out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Madame de
Bellegarde appeared to have been talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) with some intensity and
to be waiting for an answer to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had said, or for some sign of
the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) words. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hands were folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lap, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) lordship's simple physiognomy with an air of politely
suppressed irritation.

<p/>Lord Deepmere looked up as Newman approached, met his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes, and changed
color.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I disturb an interesting interview,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde rose, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) companion rising at the same time,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) answered nothing for an instant, and
then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remained silent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``It would be polite
for Lord Deepmere to say it was very interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm not polite!''  (<font color='red'><b>lordship</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lordship. <div class="bookquote">``But it _was_ interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Bellegarde was giving you some good advice, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman;
<div class="bookquote">``toning you down a little?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) some excellent advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
fresh, cold eyes upon our hero. <div class="bookquote">``It's for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to take it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it, sir--take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``Any advice the marquise
gives you to-night must be good. For to-night, marquise, you must speak
from a cheerful, comfortable spirit, and that makes good advice. You see
everything going on so brightly and successfully round you. Your party
is magnificent; it was a very happy thought. It is much better than that
thing of mine would have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are pleased I am satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``My
desire was to please you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want to please me a little more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Just drop
our lordly friend; I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wants to be off and shake his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heels a
little. Then take my arm and walk through the rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My desire was to please you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the old lady repeated. And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) liberated
Lord Deepmere, Newman rather wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) docility. <div class="bookquote">``If this young
man is wise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will go and find my daughter and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to
dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been endorsing your advice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must swallow that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Lord Deepmere wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) forehead and departed, and Madame de Bellegarde
took Newman's arm. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's a very pleasant, sociable entertainment,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the latter declared, as they proceeded on their circuit. <div class="bookquote">``Everyone seems
to know everyone and to be glad to see everyone. The marquis has made
me acquainted with ever so many people, and I feel quite like one of the
family. It's an occasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman continued, wanting to say something
thoroughly kind and comfortable, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall always remember, and
remember very pleasantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is an occasion that we shall none of us forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the
marquise, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pure, neat enunciation.

<p/>People made way for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed, others turned round and looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) received a great many greetings and pressings of the hand,
all of which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) accepted with the most delicate dignity. But though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
smiled upon everyone, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said nothing until she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reached the last of the
rooms, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) elder son. Then, <div class="bookquote">``This is enough, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
declared with measured softness to Newman, and turned to the marquis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
put out both his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands and took both hers, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to a seat with an
air of the tenderest veneration. It was a most harmonious family group,
and Newman discreetly retired. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) moved through the rooms for some time
longer, circulating freely, overtopping most people by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) great
height, renewing acquaintance with some of the groups to which Urbain de
Bellegarde had presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), and expending generally the surplus of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) equanimity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) continued to find it all extremely agreeable; but
the most agreeable things have an end, and the revelry on this occasion
began to deepen to a close. The music was sounding its ultimate strains
and people were looking for the marquise, to make their farewells. There
seemed to be some difficulty in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>), and Newman heard a report
that she (<font color='blue'><b>groups</b></font>) had left the ball, feeling faint. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>) has succumbed to the
emotions of the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard a lady say. <div class="bookquote">``Poor, dear marquise;
I can imagine all that they may have been for her (<font color='blue'><b>everyone</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) learned
immediately afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had recovered herself and was seated in
an armchair near the doorway, receiving parting compliments from great
ladies who insisted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not rising. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) himself set out in quest of
Madame de Cintré. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) move past him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) many times in the rapid
circles of a waltz, but in accordance with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) explicit instructions he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had exchanged no words with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) since the beginning of the evening.
The whole house having been thrown open, the apartments of the
_rez-de-chaussée_ were also accessible, though a smaller number of
persons had gathered there. Newman wandered through them, observing
a few scattered couples to whom this comparative seclusion appeared
grateful and reached a small conservatory which opened into the garden.
The end of the conservatory was formed by a clear sheet of glass,
unmasked by plants, and admitting the winter starlight so directly that
a person standing there would seem to have passed into the open air. Two
persons stood there now, a lady and a gentleman; the lady Newman, from
within the room and although she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back to it, immediately
recognized as Madame de Cintré. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hesitated as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
advance, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did so she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked round, feeling apparently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was there. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment and then turned again to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is almost a pity not to tell Mr. Newman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said softly, but in a
tone that Newman could hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) if you like!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman answered, in the voice of Lord
Deepmere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tell me by all means!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman advancing.

<p/>Lord Deepmere, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed, was very red in the face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had twisted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gloves into a tight cord as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been squeezing them dry.
These, presumably, were tokens of violent emotion, and it seemed to
Newman that the traces of corresponding agitation were visible in Madame
de Cintré's face. The two had been talking with much vivacity. <div class="bookquote">``What
I should tell you is only to my lord's credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré,
smiling frankly enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) wouldn't like it any better for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>said my lord, with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)
awkward laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come; what's the mystery?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Clear it up. I don't like
mysteries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We must have some things we don't like, and go without some we do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nobleman</b></font>)</div>said the ruddy young nobleman, laughing still.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's to Lord Deepmere's credit, but it is not to everyone's,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Madam de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``So I shall say nothing about it. You may be sure,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) added; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) hand to the Englishman, who took it half
shyly, half impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``And now go and dance!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, I feel awfully like dancing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``I shall go and get
tipsy.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) walked away with a gloomy guffaw.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What has happened between you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you--now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing that need make
you unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has the little Englishman been trying to make love to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) hesitated, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) uttered a grave <div class="bookquote">``No! he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>)'s a very honest
little fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are agitated. Something is the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, I repeat, that need make you unhappy. My agitation is over.
Some day I will tell you what it was; not now. I can't now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>remarked Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear anything
unpleasant. I am satisfied with everything--most of all with you. I
have seen all the ladies and talked with a great many of them; but I am
satisfied with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Madame de Cintré covered him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)
large, soft glance, and then turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) eyes away into the starry night.
So they stood silent a moment, side by side. <div class="bookquote">``Say you are satisfied with
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had to wait a moment for the answer; but it came at last, low yet
distinct: <div class="bookquote">``I am very happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>It was presently followed by a few words from another source, which made
them both turn round. <div class="bookquote">``I am sadly afraid Madame de Cintré will take a
chill. I have ventured to bring a shawl.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread stood there softly
solicitous, holding a white drapery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``the sight of those cold stars gives
one a sense of frost. I won't take your shawl, but we will go back into
the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) passed back and Newman followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>), Mrs. Bread standing
respectfully aside to make way for them. Newman paused an instant before
the old woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glanced up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a silent greeting. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,
yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you must come and live with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, sir, if you will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``you have not seen the last
of me!''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII

<p/>Newman was fond of music and went often to the opera. A couple of
evenings after Madame de Bellegarde's ball he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sat listening to <div class="bookquote">``Don
Giovanni,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>having in honor of this work, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had never yet seen
represented, come to occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) orchestra-chair before the rising of
the curtain. Frequently he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took a large box and invited a party of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) compatriots; this was a mode of recreation to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was much
addicted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) liked making up parties of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) friends and conducting them
to the theatre, and taking them to drive on high drags or to dine at
remote restaurants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) liked doing things which involved his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) paying for
people; the vulgar truth is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) enjoyed <div class="bookquote">``treating''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>them. This was
not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was what is called purse-proud; handling money in public
was on the contrary positively disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had a sort of
personal modesty about it, akin to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) would have felt about making
a toilet before spectators. But just as it was a gratification to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to
be handsomely dressed, just so it was a private satisfaction to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
enjoyed it very clandestinely-RRB- to have interposed, pecuniarily, in
a scheme of pleasure. To set a large group of people in motion and
transport them to a distance, to have special conveyances, to charter
railway-carriages and steamboats, harmonized with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) relish for
bold processes, and made hospitality seem more active and more to the
purpose. A few evenings before the occasion of which I speak he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had
invited several ladies and gentlemen to the opera to listen to Madame
Alboni--a party which included Miss Dora Finch. It befell, however, that
Miss Dora Finch, sitting near Newman in the box, discoursed brilliantly,
not only during the entr'actes, but during many of the finest portions
of the performance, so that Newman had really come away with an
irritated sense that Madame Alboni had a thin, shrill voice, and that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) musical phrase was much garnished with a laugh of the giggling
order. After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) promised himself to go for a while to the opera
alone.

<p/>When the curtain had fallen upon the first act of <div class="bookquote">``Don Giovanni''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place to observe the house. Presently, in one of
the boxes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perceived Urbain de Bellegarde and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wife. The little
marquise was sweeping the house very busily with a glass, and Newman,
supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), determined to go and bid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good evening.
M. de Bellegarde was leaning against a column, motionless, looking
straight in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), with one hand in the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) white
waistcoat and the other resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) thigh. Newman was about
to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) noticed in that obscure region devoted to the
small boxes which in France are called, not inaptly, <div class="bookquote">``bathing-tubs,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a face which even the dim light and the distance could not make wholly
indistinct. It was the face of a young and pretty woman, and it was
surmounted with a _coiffure_ of pink roses and diamonds. This person was
looking round the house, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fan was moving to and fro with the most
practiced grace; when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lowered it, Newman perceived a pair of plump
white shoulders and the edge of a rose-colored dress. Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), very
close to the shoulders and talking, apparently with an earnestness which
it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scantily to heed, sat a young man with a red face and a
very low shirt-collar. A moment's gazing left Newman with no doubts; the
pretty young woman was Noémie Nioche. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked hard into the depths of
the box, thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father might perhaps be in attendance, but from
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could see the young man's eloquence had no other auditor.
Newman at last made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way out, and in doing so he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed beneath the
_baignoire_ of Mademoiselle Noémie. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) approached and
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a nod and smile which seemed meant as an assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
still a good-natured girl, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enviable rise in the world.
Newman passed into the _foyer_ and walked through it. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused
in front of a gentleman seated on one of the divans. The gentleman's
elbows were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knees; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was leaning forward and staring at the
pavement, lost apparently in meditations of a somewhat gloomy cast. But
in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bent head Newman recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and in a moment
sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Then the gentleman looked up and displayed the
expressive countenance of Valentin de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What in the world are you thinking of so hard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A subject that requires hard thinking to do it justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.
<div class="bookquote">``My immeasurable idiocy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The matter now is that I am a man again, and no more a fool than usual.
But I came within an inch of taking that girl _au sérieux_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the young lady below stairs, in a _baignoire_ in a pink
dress?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you notice what a brilliant kind of pink it was?''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin
inquired, by way of answer. <div class="bookquote">``It makes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look as white as new milk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``White or black, as you please. But you have stopped going to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, bless you, no. Why should I stop? I have changed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hasn't,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I see she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a vulgar little wretch, after all. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
is as amusing as ever, and one _must_ be amused.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strikes you so unpleasantly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoiced. <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose you have swallowed all those fine words you used about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
the other night. You compared her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to a sapphire, or a topaz, or an
amethyst--some precious stone; what was it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``it may have been to a carbuncle! But
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't make a fool of me now. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has no real charm. It's an awfully
low thing to make a mistake about a person of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared, <div class="bookquote">``upon the scales having fallen
from your eyes. It's a great triumph; it ought to make you feel better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it makes me feel better!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, gaily. Then, checking
himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked askance at Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I rather think you are laughing
at me. If you were not one of the family I would take it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, I'm not laughing, any more than I am one of the family. You
make me feel badly. You are too clever a fellow, you are made of too
good stuff, to spend your time in ups and downs over that class of
goods. The idea of splitting hairs about Miss Nioche! It seems to me
awfully foolish. You say you have given up taking her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) seriously; but you
take her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) seriously so long as you take her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) place and looked a while at Newman,
wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forehead and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knees. <div class="bookquote">``_Vous parlez d’or_. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) has wonderfully pretty arms. Would you believe I didn't know it till
this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) is a vulgar little wretch, remember, all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; the other day she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) had the bad taste to begin to abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) father,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, in my presence. I shouldn't have expected it of her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>); it was
a disappointment; heigho!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) cares no more for her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) father than for her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) door-mat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I discovered that the first time I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that's another affair; she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) may think of the poor old beggar what
she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) pleases. But it was low in her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) to call him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) bad names; it quite threw
me off. It was about a frilled petticoat that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was to have fetched
from the washer-woman's; he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) appeared to have neglected this graceful
duty. She (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) almost boxed his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) stood there staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)
little blank eyes and smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) old hat with his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) coat-tail. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) turned round and went out without a word. Then I told her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) it was
in very bad taste to speak so to one's papa. She (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) should be so
thankful to me if I would mention it to her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) taste was at
fault; she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) had immense confidence in mine. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) I couldn't have
the bother of forming her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) manners; I had had an idea they were already
formed, after the best models. She (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) had disappointed me. But I shall get
over it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, gaily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, time's a great consoler!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered with humorous sobriety.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was silent a moment, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, in another tone, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
would think of what I said to you the other day. Come over to America
with us, and I will put you in the way of doing some business. You have
a very good head, if you will only use it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin made a genial grimace. <div class="bookquote">``My head is much obliged to you. Do you
mean the place in a bank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are several places, but I suppose you would consider the bank the
most aristocratic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin burst into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, at night all cats are
gray! When one derogates there are no degrees.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman answered nothing for a minute. Then, <div class="bookquote">``I think you will find there
are degrees in success,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said with a certain dryness.

<p/>Valentin had leaned forward again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) knees, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
was scratching the pavement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) stick. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said, looking up,
<div class="bookquote">``Do you really think I ought to do something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion's arm and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment
through sagaciously-narrowed eyelids. <div class="bookquote">``Try it and see. You are not good
enough for it, but we will stretch a point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really think I can make some money? I should like to see how it
feels to have a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do what I tell you, and you shall be rich,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Think of it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) watch and prepared to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way to Madame de
Bellegarde's box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I will think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I will go and listen
to Mozart another half hour--I can always think better to music--and
profoundly meditate upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wife when Newman entered their box; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
bland, remote, and correct as usual; or, as it seemed to Newman, even
more than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of the opera?''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>asked our hero. <div class="bookquote">``What do you think of
the Don?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We all know what Mozart is,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis; <div class="bookquote">``our impressions
don't date from this evening. Mozart is youth, freshness, brilliancy,
facility--a little too great facility, perhaps. But the execution is
here and there deplorably rough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very curious to see how it ends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak as if it were a _feuilleton_ in the _Figaro_,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>observed the
marquis. <div class="bookquote">``You have surely seen the opera before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I should have remembered it.
Donna Elvira reminds me of Madame de Cintré; I don't mean in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elvira</b></font>)
circumstances, but in the music she (<font color='blue'><b>Elvira</b></font>) sings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a very nice distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>laughed the marquis lightly. <div class="bookquote">``There is
no great possibility, I imagine, of Madame de Cintré being forsaken.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But what becomes of the Don?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The devil comes down--or comes up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``and
carries him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) off. I suppose Zerlina reminds you of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go to the _foyer_ for a few moments,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, <div class="bookquote">``and
give you a chance to say that the commander--the man of stone--resembles
me.''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed out of the box.

<p/>The little marquise stared an instant at the velvet ledge of the
balcony, and then murmured, <div class="bookquote">``Not a man of stone, a man of wood.''  (<font color='red'><b>The marquise</b></font>)</div>Newman
had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's empty chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) made no protest, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
turned suddenly and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) closed fan upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad
you came in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask you a favor. I wanted to do so on
Thursday, at my mother-in-law's ball, but you would give me no chance.
You were in such very good spirits that I thought you might grant my
little favor then; not that you look particularly doleful now. It is
something you must promise me; now is the time to take you; after you
are married you will be good for nothing. Come, promise!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never sign a paper without reading it first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Show me
your document.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you must sign with your eyes shut; I will hold your hand. Come,
before you put your head into the noose. You ought to be thankful to me
for giving you a chance to do something amusing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If it is so amusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``it will be in even better season
after I am married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In other words,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>cried Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``you will not do it at
all. You will be afraid of your wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if the thing is intrinsically improper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I won't go
into it. If it is not, I will do it after my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk like a treatise on logic, and English logic into the bargain!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``Promise, then, after you are married.
After all, I shall enjoy keeping you to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, after I am married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman serenely.

<p/>The little marquise hesitated a moment, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wondered
what was coming. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know what my life is,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presently
said. <div class="bookquote">``I have no pleasure, I see nothing, I do nothing. I live in Paris
as I might live at Poitiers. My mother-in-law calls me--what is the
pretty word?--a gad-about? accuses me of going to unheard-of places, and
thinks it ought to be joy enough for me to sit at home and count over my
ancestors on my fingers. But why should I bother about my ancestors?
I am sure they never bothered about me. I don't propose to live with
a green shade on my eyes; I hold that things were made to look at. My
husband, you know, has principles, and the first on the list is that
the Tuileries are dreadfully vulgar. If the Tuileries are vulgar, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
principles are tiresome. If I chose I might have principles quite as
well as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). If they grew on one's family tree I should only have to give
mine a shake to bring down a shower of the finest. At any rate, I prefer
clever Bonapartes to stupid Bourbons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see; you want to go to court,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, vaguely conjecturing
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to appeal to the United States legation to
smooth her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way to the imperial halls.

<p/>The marquise gave a little sharp laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You are a thousand miles away.
I will take care of the Tuileries myself; the day I decide to go they
will be very glad to have me. Sooner or later I shall dance in an
imperial quadrille. I know what you are going to say: `How will you
dare?' But I _shall_ dare. I am afraid of my husband; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is soft,
smooth, irreproachable; everything that you know; but I am afraid of
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--horribly afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). And yet I shall arrive at the Tuileries.
But that will not be this winter, nor perhaps next, and meantime I must
live. For the moment, I want to go somewhere else; it's my dream. I want
to go to the Bal Bullier.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the Bal Bullier?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>repeated Newman, for whom the words at first meant
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The ball in the Latin Quarter, where the students dance with their
mistresses. Don't tell me you have not heard of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``I have heard of it; I remember now. I have even
been there. And you want to go there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is silly, it is low, it is anything you please. But I want to go.
Some of my friends have been, and they say it is awfully _drôle_. My
friends go everywhere; it is only I who sit moping at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me you are not at home now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I shouldn't
exactly say you were moping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am bored to death. I have been to the opera twice a week for the last
eight years. Whenever I ask for anything my mouth is stopped with that:
Pray, madam, haven't you an opera box? Could a woman of taste want more?
In the first place, my opera box was down in my _contrat_; they have
to give it to me. To-night, for instance, I should have preferred a
thousand times to go to the Palais Royal. But my husband won't go to the
Palais Royal because the ladies of the court go there so much. You may
imagine, then, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would take me to Bullier's; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says it is
a mere imitation--and a bad one--of what they do at the Princess
Kleinfuss's. But as I don't go to the Princess Kleinfuss's, the next
best thing is to go to Bullier's. It is my dream, at any rate, it's
a fixed idea. All I ask of you is to give me your arm; you are less
compromising than anyone else. I don't know why, but you are. I can
arrange it. I shall risk something, but that is my own affair. Besides,
fortune favors the bold. Don't refuse me; it is my dream!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman gave a loud laugh. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hardly worth while to be the
wife of the Marquis de Bellegarde, a daughter of the crusaders, heiress
of six centuries of glories and traditions, to have centred one's
aspirations upon the sight of a couple of hundred young ladies kicking
off young men's hats. It struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as a theme for the moralist; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no time to moralize upon it. The curtain rose again; M. de
Bellegarde returned, and Newman went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seat.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed that Valentin de Bellegarde had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) place in the
_baignoire_ of Mademoiselle Nioche, behind this young lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
companion, where he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was visible only if one carefully looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>).
In the next act Newman met him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the lobby and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
reflected upon possible emigration. <div class="bookquote">``If you really meant to meditate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you might have chosen a better place for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the place was not bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of that
girl. I listened to the music, and, without thinking of the play or
looking at the stage, I turned over your proposal. At first it seemed
quite fantastic. And then a certain fiddle in the orchestra--I could
distinguish it--began to say as it scraped away, `Why not, why not?'
And then, in that rapid movement, all the fiddles took it up and the
conductor's stick seemed to beat it in the air: `Why not, why not?' I'm
sure I can't say! I don't see why not. I don't see why I shouldn't do
something. It appears to me really a very bright idea. This sort of
thing is certainly very stale. And then I could come back with a trunk
full of dollars. Besides, I might possibly find it amusing. They call me
a _raffiné_; who knows but that I might discover an unsuspected charm in
shop-keeping? It would really have a certain romantic, picturesque side;
it would look well in my biography. It would look as if I were a strong
man, a first-rate man, a man who dominated circumstances.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind how it would look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It always looks well to
have half a million of dollars. There is no reason why you shouldn't
have them if you will mind what I tell you--I alone--and not talk to
other parties.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm into that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion, and
the two walked for some time up and down one of the less frequented
corridors. Newman's imagination began to glow with the idea of
converting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bright, impracticable friend into a first-class man of
business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt for the moment a sort of spiritual zeal, the zeal
of the propagandist. Its ardor was in part the result of that general
discomfort which the sight of all uninvested capital produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); so
fine an intelligence as Bellegarde's ought to be dedicated to high uses.
The highest uses known to Newman's experience were certain transcendent
sagacities in the handling of railway stock. And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) zeal was
quickened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) personal kindness for Valentin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a sort of pity
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was well aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) never could have made the Comte de
Bellegarde understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) never lost a sense of its being pitiable that
Valentin should think it a large life to revolve in varnished boots
between the Rue d’Anjou and the Rue de l’Université, taking the
Boulevard des Italiens on the way, when over there in America one's
promenade was a continent, and one's Boulevard stretched from New York
to San Francisco. It mortified him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>), moreover, to think that Valentin
lacked money; there was a painful grotesqueness in it. It affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
as the ignorance of a companion, otherwise without reproach, touching
some rudimentary branch of learning would have done. There were things
that one knew about as a matter of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would have said in such a
case. Just so, if one pretended to be easy in the world, one had money
as a matter of course, one had made it! There was something almost
ridiculously anomalous to Newman in the sight of lively pretensions
unaccompanied by large investments in railroads; though I may add that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not have maintained that such investments were in themselves a
proper ground for pretensions. <div class="bookquote">``I will make you do something,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said
to Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``I will put you through. I know half a dozen things in
which we can make a place for you. You will see some lively work. It
will take you a little while to get used to the life, but you will work
in before long, and at the end of six months--after you have done a
thing or two on your own account--you will like it. And then it will
be very pleasant for you, having your sister over there. It will be
pleasant for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to have you, too. Yes, Valentin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>continued Newman,
pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend's arm genially, <div class="bookquote">``I think I see just the opening for
you. Keep quiet and I'll push you right in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman pursued this favoring strain for some time longer. The two
men strolled about for a quarter of an hour. Valentin listened and
questioned, many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) questions making Newman laugh loud at the
_naïveté_ of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ignorance of the vulgar processes of money-getting;
smiling himself, too, half ironical and half curious. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
serious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was fascinated by Newman's plain prose version of the legend
of El Dorado. It is true, however, that though to accept an <div class="bookquote">``opening''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in an American mercantile house might be a bold, original, and in its
consequences extremely agreeable thing to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not quite see
himself objectively doing it. So that when the bell rang to indicate the
close of the entr'acte, there was a certain mock-heroism in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saying,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brilliant smile, <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, put me through; push me in! I
make myself over to you. Dip me into the pot and turn me into gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>They had passed into the corridor which encircled the row of
_baignoires_, and Valentin stopped in front of the dusky little box in
which Mademoiselle Nioche had bestowed herself, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand on the
doorknob. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, are you going back there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Mon Dieu, oui_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you another place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have my usual place, in the stalls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go and occupy it, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) very well from there, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>added Valentin, serenely, <div class="bookquote">``and
to-night she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is worth seeing. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) added in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``I have a
particular reason for going back just now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I give you up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You are infatuated!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is only this. There is a young man in the box whom I shall annoy
by going in, and I want to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Can't you leave the poor fellow
alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has given me cause. The box is not his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). Noémie came in alone
and installed herself. I went and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>), and in a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>)
asked me to go and get her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) fan from the pocket of her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) cloak, which the
_ouvreuse_ had carried off. In my absence this gentleman came in
and took the chair beside Noémie in which I had been sitting. My
reappearance disgusted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had the grossness to show it. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came
within an ace of being impertinent. I don't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is some
vulgar wretch. I can't think where she (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) picks up such acquaintances. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
has been drinking, too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is about. Just now, in the
second act, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was unmannerly again. I shall put in another appearance
for ten minutes--time enough to give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) an opportunity to commit
himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feels inclined. I really can't let the brute suppose that
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is keeping me out of the box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, remonstrantly, <div class="bookquote">``what child's play! You
are not going to pick a quarrel about that girl, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That girl has nothing to do with it, and I have no intention of picking
a quarrel. I am not a bully nor a fire-eater. I simply wish to make a
point that a gentleman must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn your point!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That is the trouble with you
Frenchmen; you must be always making points. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``be short.
But if you are going in for this kind of thing, we must ship you off to
America in advance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin answered, <div class="bookquote">``whenever you please. But if I go to
America, I must not let this gentleman suppose that it is to run away
from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>And they separated. At the end of the act Newman observed that Valentin
was still in the _baignoire_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strolled into the corridor again,
expecting to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was within a few yards of
Mademoiselle Nioche's box saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend pass out, accompanied by
the young man who had been seated beside its fair occupant. The two
gentlemen walked with some quickness of step to a distant part of the
lobby, where Newman perceived them stop and stand talking. The manner
of each was perfectly quiet, but the stranger, who looked flushed, had
begun to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face very emphatically with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief.
By this time Newman was abreast of the _baignoire_; the door had been
left ajar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could see a pink dress inside. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) immediately went in.
Mademoiselle Nioche turned and greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a brilliant smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have at last decided to come and see me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``You
just save your politeness. You find me in a fine moment. Sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a very becoming little flush in her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) cheek, and her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye had a
noticeable spark. You would have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had received some very
good news.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something has happened here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, without sitting down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You find me in a very fine moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Two gentlemen--one
of them is M. de Bellegarde, the pleasure of whose acquaintance I owe to
you--have just had words about your humble servant. Very big words too.
They can't come off without crossing swords. A duel--that will give me
a push!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mademoiselle Noémie/Noémie/Mademoiselle</b></font>)</div>cried Mademoiselle Noémie clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) little hands. <div class="bookquote">``_C’est ça
qui pose une femme!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say that Bellegarde is going to fight about _you!_''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman disgustedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a hard little smile. <div class="bookquote">``No, no,
you are not _galant!_ And if you prevent this affair I shall owe you a
grudge--and pay my debt!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman uttered an imprecation which, though brief--it consisted simply
of the interjection <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>followed by a geographical, or more
correctly, perhaps a theological noun in four letters--had better not
be transferred to these pages. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) back without more ceremony
upon the pink dress and went out of the box. In the corridor he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found
Valentin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) companion walking towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). The latter was thrusting
a card into his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) waistcoat pocket. Mademoiselle Noémie's jealous votary
was a tall, robust young man with a thick nose, a prominent blue eye, a
Germanic physiognomy, and a massive watch-chain. When they reached the
box, Valentin with an emphasized bow made way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) to pass in first.
Newman touched Valentin's arm as a sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wished to speak with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and Bellegarde answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) would be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) in an instant.
Valentin entered the box after the robust young man, but a couple of
minutes afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) reappeared, largely smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is immensely tickled,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) says we will make her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) fortune.
I don't want to be fatuous, but I think it is very possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you are going to fight?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, don't look so mortally disgusted. It was not my choice.
The thing is all arranged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>groaned Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told _him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good friend, it doesn't matter what. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) used an expression--I took
it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I insist upon knowing; I can't, as your elder brother, have you
rushing into this sort of nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to
conceal, but I can't go into particulars now and here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We will leave this place, then. You can tell me outside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, I can't leave this place, why should I hurry away? I will go to
my orchestra-stall and sit out the opera.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not enjoy it; you will be preoccupied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) a moment, colored a little, smiled, and patted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) on the arm. <div class="bookquote">``You are delightfully simple! Before an affair a man is
quiet. The quietest thing I can do is to go straight to my place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``you want her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to see you there--you and your
quietness. I am not so simple! It is a poor business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin remained, and the two men, in their respective places, sat
out the rest of the performance, which was also enjoyed by Mademoiselle
Nioche and her (<font color='blue'><b>couple</b></font>) truculent admirer. At the end Newman joined Valentin
again, and they went into the street together. Valentin shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) friend's proposal that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) should get into Newman's own vehicle,
and stopped on the edge of the pavement. <div class="bookquote">``I must go off alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
said; <div class="bookquote">``I must look up a couple of friends who will take charge of this
matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will take charge of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared. <div class="bookquote">``Put it into my hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very kind, but that is hardly possible. In the first place, you
are, as you said just now, almost my brother; you are about to marry
my sister. That alone disqualifies you; it casts doubts on your
impartiality. And if it didn't, it would be enough for me that I
strongly suspect you of disapproving of the affair. You would try to
prevent a meeting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I should,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Whoever your friends are, I hope
they will do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unquestionably they will. They will urge that excuses be made, proper
excuses. But you would be too good-natured. You won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was silent a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was keenly annoyed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw it was
useless to attempt interference. <div class="bookquote">``When is this precious performance to
come off?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sooner the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``The day after to-morrow, I
hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I have certainly a claim to know the facts. I
can't consent to shut my eyes to the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to tell you the facts,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``They are
very simple, and it will be quickly done. But now everything depends on
my putting my hands on my friends without delay. I will jump into a cab;
you had better drive to my room and wait for me there. I will turn up at
the end of an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman assented protestingly, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend go, and then betook himself
to the picturesque little apartment in the Rue d’Anjou. It was more
than an hour before Valentin returned, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was able
to announce that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had found one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) desired friends, and that this
gentleman had taken upon himself the care of securing an associate.
Newman had been sitting without lights by Valentin's faded fire, upon
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had thrown a log; the blaze played over the richly-encumbered
little sitting-room and produced fantastic gleams and shadows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
listened in silence to Valentin's account of what had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
and the gentleman whose card he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) pocket--M. Stanislas Kapp,
of Strasbourg--after his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) return to Mademoiselle Nioche's box. This
hospitable young lady had espied an acquaintance on the other side
of the house, and had expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) displeasure at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) not having the
civility to come and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a visit. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, let him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Stanislas Kapp/M. Kapp/M. Stanislas</b></font>)</div>M. Stanislas
Kapp had hereupon exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``There are too many people in the box
already.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) had fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) eyes with a demonstrative stare upon M.
de Bellegarde. Valentin had promptly retorted that if there were too
many people in the box it was easy for M. Kapp to diminish the number.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to open the door for _you!_''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Stanislas Kapp/M. Kapp/M. Stanislas</b></font>)</div>M. Kapp exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``I shall be delighted to fling you into the pit!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin had answered.
<div class="bookquote">``Oh, do make a rumpus and get into the papers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Noémie</b></font>)</div>Miss Noémie had
gleefully ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``M. Kapp, turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) out; or, M. de Bellegarde,
pitch him (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) into the pit, into the orchestra--anywhere! I don't care who
does which, so long as you make a scene.''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin answered that they
would make no scene, but that the gentleman would be so good as to
step into the corridor with him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). In the corridor, after a brief further
exchange of words, there had been an exchange of cards. M. Stanislas
Kapp was very stiff. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) evidently meant to force his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) offence home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man, no doubt, was insolent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said; <div class="bookquote">``but if you hadn't gone
back into the box the thing wouldn't have happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin replied, ``that the event proves the
extreme propriety of my going back into the box? M. Kapp wished to
provoke me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) was awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) chance. In such a case--that is, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) has been, so to speak, notified--a man must be on hand to receive the
provocation. My not returning would simply have been tantamount to
my saying to M. Stanislas Kapp, `Oh, if you are going to be
disagreeable'''--

<p/>```You must manage it by yourself; damned if I'll help you!' That would
have been a thoroughly sensible thing to say. The only attraction for
you seems to have been the prospect of M. Kapp's impertinence,'' Newman
went on. <div class="bookquote">``You told me you were not going back for that girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't mention that girl any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>murmured Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a
bore.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart. But if that is the way you feel about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), why
couldn't you let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head with a fine smile. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you quite
understand, and I don't believe I can make you. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) understood the
situation; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew what was in the air; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was watching us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A cat may look at a king! What difference does that make?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, a man can't back down before a woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a woman. You said yourself she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a stone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried
Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``there is no disputing about tastes. It's a
matter of feeling; it's measured by one's sense of honor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, confound your sense of honor!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is vain talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``words have passed, and the thing
is settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman turned away, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat. Then pausing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on the
door, <div class="bookquote">``What are you going to use?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is for M. Stanislas Kapp, as the challenged party, to decide.
My own choice would be a short, light sword. I handle it well. I'm an
indifferent shot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman had put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pushed it back, gently scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
forehead, high up. <div class="bookquote">``I wish it were pistols,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I could show you
how to lodge a bullet!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin broke into a laugh. <div class="bookquote">``What is it some English poet says about
consistency? It's a flower, or a star, or a jewel. Yours has the beauty
of all three!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) agreed to see Newman again on the morrow, after
the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) meeting with M. Stanislas Kapp should have been
arranged.

<p/>In the course of the day Newman received three lines from him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), saying
that it had been decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should cross the frontier, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
adversary, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was to take the night express to Geneva. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
should have time, however, to dine with Newman. In the afternoon Newman
called upon Madame de Cintré, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visit was brief. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was as
gracious and sympathetic as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had ever found her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was sad, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) confessed, on Newman's charging her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) red eyes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
been crying. Valentin had been with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a couple of hours before, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) visit had left her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) with a painful impression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had laughed and
gossiped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) no bad news, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had only been, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
manner, rather more affectionate than usual. His (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) fraternal tenderness
had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) departure she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had burst into tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
felt as if something strange and sad were going to happen; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had tried
to reason away the fancy, and the effort had only given her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a headache.
Newman, of course, was perforce tongue-tied about Valentin's projected
duel, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) dramatic talent was not equal to satirizing Madame de
Cintré's presentiment as pointedly as perfect security demanded. Before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) went away he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) asked Madame de Cintré whether Valentin had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) didn't make her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in Newman's own apartment that Valentin dined, having brought
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) portmanteau, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) might adjourn directly to the railway. M.
Stanislas Kapp had positively declined to make excuses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>)
side, obviously, had none to offer. Valentin had found out with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
was dealing. M. Stanislas Kapp was the son of and heir of a rich brewer
of Strasbourg, a youth of a sanguineous--and sanguinary--temperament.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) was making ducks and drakes of the paternal brewery, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>)
passed in a general way for a good fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kapp</b></font>) had already been observed
to be quarrelsome after dinner. <div class="bookquote">``_Que voulez-vous?_''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.
<div class="bookquote">``Brought up on beer, he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) can't stand champagne.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had chosen pistols.
Valentin, at dinner, had an excellent appetite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) made a point, in view
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) long journey, of eating more than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) took the liberty
of suggesting to Newman a slight modification in the composition of a
certain fish-sauce; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought it would be worth mentioning to the
cook. But Newman had no thoughts for fish-sauce; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt thoroughly
discontented. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat and watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) amiable and clever companion
going through his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) excellent repast with the delicate deliberation of
hereditary epicurism, the folly of so charming a fellow traveling off
to expose his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) agreeable young life for the sake of M. Stanislas and
Mademoiselle Noémie struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Stanislas</b></font>) with intolerable force. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stanislas</b></font>) had grown fond
of Valentin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) felt now how fond; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) sense of helplessness only
increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, this sort of thing may be all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) cried at last, <div class="bookquote">``but
I declare I don't see it. I can't stop you, perhaps, but at least I can
protest. I do protest, violently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, don't make a scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``Scenes in these
cases are in very bad taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your duel itself is a scene,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that's all it is! It's a
wretched theatrical affair. Why don't you take a band of music with you
outright? It's d--d barbarous and it's d--d corrupt, both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I can't begin, at this time of day, to defend the theory of
dueling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``It is our custom, and I think it is a good
thing. Quite apart from the goodness of the cause in which a duel may
be fought, it has a kind of picturesque charm which in this age of
vile prose seems to me greatly to recommend it. It's a remnant of a
higher-tempered time; one ought to cling to it. Depend upon it, a duel
is never amiss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by a higher-tempered time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``Because your great-grandfather was an ass, is that any reason why you
should be? For my part I think we had better let our temper take care of
itself; it generally seems to me quite high enough; I am not afraid
of being too meek. If your great-grandfather were to make himself
unpleasant to me, I think I could manage him (<font color='blue'><b>great-grandfather</b></font>) yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``you can't invent anything
that will take the place of satisfaction for an insult. To demand it and
to give it are equally excellent arrangements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call this sort of thing satisfaction?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked. <div class="bookquote">``Does it
satisfy you to receive a present of the carcass of that coarse fop? does
it gratify you to make him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a present of yours? If a man hits you, hit
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back; if a man libels you, haul him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haul him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up, into court? Oh, that is very nasty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The nastiness is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--not yours. And for that matter, what you are
doing is not particularly nice. You are too good for it. I don't say
you are the most useful man in the world, or the cleverest, or the
most amiable. But you are too good to go and get your throat cut for a
prostitute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin flushed a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) laughed. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't get my throat cut
if I can help it. Moreover, one's honor hasn't two different measures.
It only knows that it is hurt; it doesn't ask when, or how, or where.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more fool it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Valentin ceased to laugh; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``I beg you not to say
any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If you do I shall almost fancy you don't care
about--about'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About that matter--about one's honor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fancy what you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Fancy while you are at it that
I care about _you_--though you are not worth it. But come back without
damage,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``and I will forgive you. And then,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued, as Valentin was going, <div class="bookquote">``I will ship you straight off to
America.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>answered Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``if I am to turn over a new page, this may
figure as a tail-piece to the old.''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) lit another cigar and
departed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Blast that girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman as the door closed upon Valentin.



<p/>CHAPTER XVIII

<p/>Newman went the next morning to see Madame de Cintré, timing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
visit so as to arrive after the noonday breakfast. In the court of the
_hôtel_, before the portico, stood Madame de Bellegarde's old square
carriage. The servant who opened the door answered Newman's inquiry with
a slightly embarrassed and hesitating murmur, and at the same moment
Mrs. Bread appeared in the background, dim-visaged as usual, and wearing
a large black bonnet and shawl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Is Madame la Comtesse at home, or
not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread advanced, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) held
a sealed letter, very delicately, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) fingers. <div class="bookquote">``The countess has left
a message for you, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) has left this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, holding out
the letter, which Newman took.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Left it? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) out? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) gone away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is going away, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is leaving town,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leaving town!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman. <div class="bookquote">``What has happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not for me to say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes on the
ground. <div class="bookquote">``But I thought it would come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would come, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman demanded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had broken the seal of the
letter, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) still questioned. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is in the house? She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is visible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) expected you this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiting-woman</b></font>)</div>the old waiting-woman
replied. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was to leave immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Fleurières.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Fleurières? But surely I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread hesitated a moment, and then clasping together her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) two hands,
<div class="bookquote">``I will take you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) led the way upstairs. At the top
of the staircase she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) paused and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) dry, sad eyes upon Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Be
very easy with her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is most unhappy!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) went on
to Madame de Cintré's apartment; Newman, perplexed and alarmed, followed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) rapidly. Mrs. Bread threw open the door, and Newman pushed back the
curtain at the farther side of its deep embrasure. In the middle of the
room stood Madame de Cintré; her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) face was pale and she (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was dressed
for traveling. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), before the fire-place, stood Urbain de
Bellegarde, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) finger-nails; near the marquis sat his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
mother, buried in an armchair, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes immediately fixing
themselves upon Newman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) entered the room, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was in the presence of something evil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was startled and pained, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
would have been by a threatening cry in the stillness of the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
walked straight to Madame de Cintré and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) by the hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked commandingly; <div class="bookquote">``what is happening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Urbain de Bellegarde stared, then left his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) place and came and leaned
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother's chair, behind. Newman's sudden irruption had evidently
discomposed both mother and son. Madame de Cintré stood silent, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes resting upon Newman's. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had often looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
soul, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); but in this present gaze there was a sort of
bottomless depth. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in distress; it was the most touching thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had ever seen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart rose into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) throat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was on the point
of turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companions, with an angry challenge; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) checked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), pressing the hand that held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something very grave has happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot marry you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand and stood staring, first at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and then at the
others. <div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked, as quietly as possible.

<p/>Madame de Cintré almost smiled, but the attempt was strange. <div class="bookquote">``You must
ask my mother, you must ask my brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marry me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, looking at them.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde did not move in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) place, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was as pale as
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter. The marquis looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said nothing for some
moments, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keen, clear eyes upon Newman, bravely. The
marquis drew himself up and looked at the ceiling. <div class="bookquote">``It's impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's improper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/>Newman began to laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are fooling!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My sister, you have no time; you are losing your train,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the
marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; don't think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``But I am going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the country, to Fleurières; to be alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To leave me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, slowly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't see you, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_Now_--why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, simply.

<p/>Newman turned toward the marquis. <div class="bookquote">``What have you done to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)--what does
it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked with the same effort at calmness, the fruit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) constant practice in taking things easily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was excited, but
excitement with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was only an intenser deliberateness; it was the
swimmer stripped.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means that I have given you up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``It means
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) face was too charged with tragic expression not fully to confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
words. Newman was profoundly shocked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt as yet no resentment
against her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was amazed, bewildered, and the presence of the old
marquise and her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) son seemed to smite his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) eyes like the glare of a
watchman's lantern. <div class="bookquote">``Can't I see you alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be only more painful. I hoped I should not see you--I should
escape. I wrote to you. Good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hand again.

<p/>Newman put both his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pockets. <div class="bookquote">``I will go with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``Will you grant me a last request?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and as she (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), urging this, her (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) eyes filled with tears. <div class="bookquote">``Let
me go alone--let me go in peace. I can't call it peace--it's death. But
let me bury myself. So--good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hair and stood slowly rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head
and looking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) keenly-narrowed eyes from one to the other of
the three persons before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lips were compressed, and the two
lines which had formed themselves beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mouth might have made
it appear at a first glance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was smiling. I have said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
excitement was an intenser deliberateness, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked grimly
deliberate. <div class="bookquote">``It seems very much as if you had interfered, marquis,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said slowly. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you said you wouldn't interfere. I know
you don't like me; but that doesn't make any difference. I thought you
promised me you wouldn't interfere. I thought you swore on your honor
that you wouldn't interfere. Don't you remember, marquis?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) eyebrows; but he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was apparently determined to be
even more urbane than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) two hands upon the back of
his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mother's chair and bent forward, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) were leaning over the edge
of a pulpit or a lecture-desk. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) did not smile, but he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) looked softly
grave. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I assured you that I would not
influence my sister's decision. I adhered, to the letter, to my
engagement. Did I not, sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't appeal, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div>said the marquise, <div class="bookquote">``your word is sufficient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquise</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) accepted me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That is very true, I can't deny
that. At least,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, in a different tone, turning to Madame de
Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``you _did_ accept me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Something in the tone seemed to move her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) strongly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away,
burying her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have interfered now, haven't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>inquired Newman of the
marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither then nor now have I attempted to influence my sister. I used no
persuasion then, I have used no persuasion to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what have you used?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have used authority,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde in a rich, bell-like
voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have used authority,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``They have used
authority,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on, turning to Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``What is it? how
did they use it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother commanded,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Commanded you to give me up--I see. And you obey--I see. But why do you
obey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/>Madame de Cintré looked across at the old marquise; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes slowly
measured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from head to foot. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of my mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde rose with a certain quickness, crying, <div class="bookquote">``This is a
most indecent scene!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no wish to prolong it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré; and turning to
the door she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand again. <div class="bookquote">``If you can pity me a little, let
me go alone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman shook her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand quietly and firmly. <div class="bookquote">``I'll come down there,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said. The _portière_ dropped behind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and Newman sank with a long
breath into the nearest chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned back in it, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands
on the knobs of the arms and looking at Madame de Bellegarde and Urbain.
There was a long silence. They stood side by side, with their heads high
and their handsome eyebrows arched.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you make a distinction?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said at last. <div class="bookquote">``You make a
distinction between persuading and commanding? It's very neat. But the
distinction is in favor of commanding. That rather spoils it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have not the least objection to defining our position,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de
Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``We understand that it should not at first appear to you
quite clear. We rather expected, indeed, that you should not do us
justice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'll do you justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid. Please
proceed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquise</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquise laid her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's arm, as if to deprecate the
attempt to define their position. <div class="bookquote">``It is quite useless,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to
try and arrange this matter so as to make it agreeable to you. It can
never be agreeable to you. It is a disappointment, and disappointments
are unpleasant. I thought it over carefully and tried to arrange it
better; but I only gave myself a headache and lost my sleep. Say what
we will, you will think yourself ill-treated, and you will publish your
wrongs among your friends. But we are not afraid of that. Besides, your
friends are not our friends, and it will not matter. Think of us as you
please. I only beg you not to be violent. I have never in my life
been present at a violent scene of any kind, and at my age I can't be
expected to begin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is _that_ all you have got to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman, slowly rising out
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">``That's a poor show for a clever lady like you, marquise.
Come, try again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother goes to the point, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) usual honesty and intrepidity,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, toying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) watch-guard. <div class="bookquote">``But it is perhaps well
to say a little more. We of course quite repudiate the charge of having
broken faith with you. We left you entirely at liberty to make yourself
agreeable to my sister. We left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quite at liberty to entertain your
proposal. When she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) accepted you we said nothing. We therefore quite
observed our promise. It was only at a later stage of the affair, and
on quite a different basis, as it were, that we determined to speak. It
would have been better, perhaps, if we had spoken before. But really,
you see, nothing has yet been done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing has yet been done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman repeated the words, unconscious
of their comical effect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had lost the sense of what the marquis was
saying; M. de Bellegarde's superior style was a mere humming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
ears. All that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) understood, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) deep and simple indignation, was
that the matter was not a violent joke, and that the people before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
were perfectly serious. <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I can take this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked.
<div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose it can matter to me what you say? Do you suppose I can
seriously listen to you? You are simply crazy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde gave a rap with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fan in the palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``If you don't take it you can leave it, sir. It matters very little what
you do. My daughter has given you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) doesn't mean it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared after a moment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I can assure you that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor woman, what damnable thing have you done to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gently, gently!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>murmured M. de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``I commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head, heavily. <div class="bookquote">``This sort of thing can't be, you know,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``A man can't be used in this fashion. You have got no right;
you have got no power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My power,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``is in my children's obedience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In their fear, your daughter said. There is something very strange
in it. Why should your daughter be afraid of you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>added Newman, after
looking a moment at the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``There is some foul play.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquise</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquise met his (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) gaze without flinching, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not
hear or heed what he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I did my best,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``I could
endure it no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a bold experiment!''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis.

<p/>Newman felt disposed to walk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), clutch his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fingers
and press his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) windpipe with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thumb. <div class="bookquote">``I needn't tell you how you
strike me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``of course you know that. But I should think you
would be afraid of your friends--all those people you introduced me to
the other night. There were some very nice people among them; you may
depend upon it there were some honest men and women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our friends approve us,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``there is not a family
among them that would have acted otherwise. And however that may be,
we take the cue from no one. The Bellegardes have been used to set the
example, not to wait for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have waited long before anyone would have set you such an
example as this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Have I done anything wrong?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Have I given you reason to change your opinion? Have you
found out anything against me? I can't imagine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``is quite the same as at
first--exactly. We have no ill-will towards yourself; we are very far
from accusing you of misconduct. Since your relations with us began you
have been, I frankly confess, less--less peculiar than I expected. It
is not your disposition that we object to, it is your antecedents. We
really cannot reconcile ourselves to a commercial person. We fancied in
an evil hour that we could; it was a great misfortune. We determined to
persevere to the end, and to give you every advantage. I was resolved
that you should have no reason to accuse me of want of loyalty. We let
the thing certainly go very far; we introduced you to our friends. To
tell the truth, it was that, I think, that broke me down. I succumbed
to the scene that took place on Thursday night in these rooms. You must
excuse me if what I say is disagreeable to you, but we cannot release
ourselves without an explanation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There can be no better proof of our good faith,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis,
<div class="bookquote">``than our committing ourselves to you in the eyes of the world the other
evening. We endeavored to bind ourselves--to tie our hands, as it were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was that,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>added his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``that opened our eyes and broke our
bonds. We should have been most uncomfortable! You know,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added in a
moment, <div class="bookquote">``that you were forewarned. I told you we were very proud.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat and began mechanically to smooth it; the very
fierceness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) scorn kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) from speaking. <div class="bookquote">``You are not proud
enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In all this matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I really see nothing
but our humility.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us have no more discussion than is necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>resumed Madame de
Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``My daughter told you everything when she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) gave you
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not satisfied about your daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``I want to know
what you did to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). It is all very easy talking about authority and
saying you commanded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) didn't accept me blindly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wouldn't
have given me up blindly. Not that I believe yet she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has really given me
up; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will talk it over with me. But you have frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), you have
bullied her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), you have _hurt_ her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). What was it you did to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did very little!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde, in a tone which gave
Newman a chill when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) afterwards remembered it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me remind you that we offered you these explanations,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>the marquis
observed, <div class="bookquote">``with the express understanding that you should abstain from
violence of language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not violent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, <div class="bookquote">``it is you who are violent! But I
don't know that I have much more to say to you. What you expect of
me, apparently, is to go my way, thanking you for favors received, and
promising never to trouble you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We expect of you to act like a clever man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.
<div class="bookquote">``You have shown yourself that already, and what we have done is
altogether based upon your being so. When one must submit, one must.
Since my daughter absolutely withdraws, what will be the use of your
making a noise?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It remains to be seen whether your daughter absolutely withdraws. Your
daughter and I are still very good friends; nothing is changed in that.
As I say, I will talk it over with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be of no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``I know my daughter well
enough to know that words spoken as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) just now spoke to you are final.
Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has promised me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) promise is worth a great deal more than your own,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``nevertheless I don't give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please! But if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) won't even see you,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
won't,--your constancy must remain purely Platonic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Newman was feigning a greater confidence than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt. Madame de
Cintré's strange intensity had in fact struck a chill to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
face, still impressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) vision, had been a terribly vivid image
of renunciation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt sick, and suddenly helpless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away and
stood for a moment with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on the door; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) faced about and
after the briefest hesitation broke out with a different accent. <div class="bookquote">``Come,
think of what this must be to me, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) alone! Why should you
object to me so--what's the matter with me? I can't hurt you. I wouldn't
if I could. I'm the most unobjectionable fellow in the world. What if
I am a commercial person? What under the sun do you mean? A commercial
person? I will be any sort of a person you want. I never talked to you
about business. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) go, and I will ask no questions. I will take
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) away, and you shall never see me or hear of me again. I will stay in
America if you like. I'll sign a paper promising never to come back to
Europe! All I want is not to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son exchanged a glance of lucid irony, and
Urbain said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, what you propose is hardly an improvement. We
have not the slightest objection to seeing you, as an amiable foreigner,
and we have every reason for not wishing to be eternally separated
from my sister. We object to the marriage; and in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>and M. de
Bellegarde gave a small, thin laugh, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be more married than
ever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``where is this place of yours--Fleurières? I
know it is near some old city on a hill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. Poitiers is on a hill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know how old it is. We are not afraid to tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Poitiers, is it? Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I shall immediately
follow Madame de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The trains after this hour won't serve you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Urbain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall hire a special train!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be a very silly waste of money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be time enough to talk about waste three days hence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
answered; and clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) departed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not immediately start for Fleurières; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was too stunned and
wounded for consecutive action. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply walked; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked straight
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), following the river, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got out of the _enceinte_ of
Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a burning, tingling sense of personal outrage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) life received so absolute a check; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never been pulled
up, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``let down,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so short; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found the
sensation intolerable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strode along, tapping the trees and lamp-posts
fiercely with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stick and inwardly raging. To lose Madame de Cintré
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had taken such jubilant and triumphant possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was as
great an affront to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pride as it was an injury to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) happiness.
And to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) by the interference and the dictation of others, by
an impudent old woman and a pretentious fop stepping in with their
<div class="bookquote">``authority'' (<font color='red'><b>a fop</b></font>)</div>! It was too preposterous, it was too pitiful. Upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
deemed the unblushing treachery of the Bellegardes Newman wasted little
thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) consigned it, once for all, to eternal perdition. But the
treachery of Madame de Cintré herself amazed and confounded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); there
was a key to the mystery, of course, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) groped for it in vain. Only
three days had elapsed since she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the starlight,
beautiful and tranquil as the trust with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was happy in the prospect of their marriage. What was
the meaning of the change? of what infernal potion had she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tasted? Poor
Newman had a terrible apprehension that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had really changed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) very
admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attached the idea of force and weight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rupture.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not rail at her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as false, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was unhappy.
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had crossed one of the bridges of the Seine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) still
followed, unheedingly, the long, unbroken quay. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had left Paris behind
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was almost in the country; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was in the pleasant suburb of
Auteuil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped at last, looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) without seeing or caring
for its pleasantness, and then slowly turned and at a slower pace
retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) steps. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came abreast of the fantastic embankment
known as the Trocadero, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reflected, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) throbbing pain,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was near Mrs. Tristram's dwelling, and that Mrs. Tristram, on
particular occasions, had much of a woman's kindness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) utterance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) needed to pour out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ire and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took the road to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) house. Mrs. Tristram was at home and alone, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) entering the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come for. Newman sat down heavily, in silence, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They have backed out!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you may think it strange, but
I felt something the other night in the air.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
story; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) listened, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had finished
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said quietly, <div class="bookquote">``They want her (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) to marry Lord Deepmere.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Newman stared.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) knew anything about Lord Deepmere. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram added.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``_She (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>)_ marry that poor little cub!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lord! And yet,
why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Madame</b></font>) refuse me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that isn't the only thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``They really
couldn't endure you any longer. They had overrated their courage. I must
say, to give the devil his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) due, that there is something rather fine
in that. It was your commercial quality in the abstract they couldn't
swallow. That is really aristocratic. They wanted your money, but they
have given you up for an idea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman frowned most ruefully, and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat again. <div class="bookquote">``I thought you
would encourage me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, with almost childlike sadness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) answered very gently. <div class="bookquote">``I feel none the less sorry
for you, especially as I am at the bottom of your troubles. I have not

he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) is not younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) looks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) is thirty-three years old; I
looked in the Peerage. But no--I can't believe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so horribly, cruelly
false.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please say nothing against her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) _is_ cruel. But of course you will go after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and you
will plead powerfully. Do you know that as you are now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram
pursued, with characteristic audacity of comment, <div class="bookquote">``you are extremely
eloquent, even without speaking? To resist you a woman must have a very

come to me in that fine fashion! But go to Madame de Cintré at any rate,
and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a puzzle even to me. I am very curious to see
how far family discipline will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman sat a while longer, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knees and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands, and Mrs. Tristram continued to temper charity with
philosophy and compassion with criticism. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) inquired, <div class="bookquote">``And
what does the Count Valentin say to it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Newman started; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not
thought of Valentin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) errand on the Swiss frontier since the
morning. The reflection made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) restless again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
leave. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went straight to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) apartment, where, upon the table of the
vestibule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found a telegram. It ran -LRB-with the date and place-RRB- as
follows: <div class="bookquote">``I am seriously ill; please to come to me as soon as possible.
V. B.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman groaned at this miserable news, and at the necessity of
deferring his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) journey to the Château de Fleurières. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wrote to
Madame de Cintré these few lines; they were all he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had time for:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't give you up, and I don't really believe you give me up. I don't
understand it, but we shall clear it up together. I can't follow you
to-day, as I am called to see a friend at a distance who is very ill,
perhaps dying. But I shall come to you as soon as I can leave my friend.
Why shouldn't I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is your brother? C. N.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had only time to catch the night express to Geneva.



<p/>CHAPTER XIX

<p/>Newman possessed a remarkable talent for sitting still when it was
necessary, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had an opportunity to use it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) journey to
Switzerland. The successive hours of the night brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) no sleep, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat motionless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) corner of the railway-carriage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes
closed, and the most observant of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fellow-travelers might have envied
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) apparent slumber. Toward morning slumber really came, as an
effect of mental rather than of physical fatigue. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) slept for a couple
of hours, and at last, waking, found his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes resting upon one of the
snow-powdered peaks of the Jura, behind which the sky was just reddening
with the dawn. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw neither the cold mountain nor the warm sky;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) consciousness began to throb again, on the very instant, with a
sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got out of the train half an hour before it
reached Geneva, in the cold morning twilight, at the station indicated
in Valentin's telegram. A drowsy station-master was on the platform
with a lantern, and the hood of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) overcoat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head, and near him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
stood a gentleman who advanced to meet Newman. This personage was a man
of forty, with a tall lean figure, a sallow face, a dark eye, a neat
moustache, and a pair of fresh gloves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat, looking very
grave, and pronounced Newman's name. Our hero assented and said, <div class="bookquote">``You
are M. de Bellegarde's friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I unite with you in claiming that sad honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman.
<div class="bookquote">``I had placed myself at M. de Bellegarde's service in this melancholy
affair, together with M. de Grosjoyaux, who is now at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) bedside. M. de
Grosjoyaux, I believe, has had the honor of meeting you in Paris, but as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) is a better nurse than I he (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) remained with our poor friend. Bellegarde
has been eagerly expecting you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how is Bellegarde?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was badly hit?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor has condemned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>); we brought a surgeon with us. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
will die in the best sentiments. I sent last evening for the curé of the
nearest French village, who spent an hour with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). The curé was quite
satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Heaven forgive us!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>groaned Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I would rather the doctor were
satisfied! And can he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) see me--shall he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) know me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I left him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), half an hour ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had fallen asleep after a
feverish, wakeful night. But we shall see.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And Newman's companion
proceeded to lead the way out of the station to the village, explaining
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went that the little party was lodged in the humblest of Swiss
inns, where, however, they had succeeded in making M. de Bellegarde much
more comfortable than could at first have been expected. <div class="bookquote">``We are old
companions in arms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin's second; <div class="bookquote">``it is not the first time
that one of us has helped the other to lie easily. It is a very nasty
wound, and the nastiest thing about it is that Bellegarde's adversary
was not shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) bullet where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) could. It took it into its head
to walk straight into Bellegarde's left side, just below the heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>As they picked their way in the gray, deceptive dawn, between the
manure-heaps of the village street, Newman's new acquaintance narrated
the particulars of the duel. The conditions of the meeting had been that
if the first exchange of shots should fail to satisfy one of the two
gentlemen, a second should take place. Valentin's first bullet had done
exactly what Newman's companion was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had intended it to do;
it had grazed the arm of M. Stanislas Kapp, just scratching the flesh.
M. Kapp's own projectile, meanwhile, had passed at ten good inches from
the person of Valentin. The representatives of M. Stanislas had demanded
another shot, which was granted. Valentin had then fired aside and the
young Alsatian had done effective execution. <div class="bookquote">``I saw, when we met him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
on the ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman's informant, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was not going to be
_commode_. It is a kind of bovine temperament.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman informant</b></font>)</div>Valentin had immediately
been installed at the inn, and M. Stanislas and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stanislas</b></font>) friends had
withdrawn to regions unknown. The police authorities of the canton had
waited upon the party at the inn, had been extremely majestic, and had
drawn up a long _procès-verbal_; but it was probable that they would
wink at so very gentlemanly a bit of bloodshed. Newman asked whether a
message had not been sent to Valentin's family, and learned that up to
a late hour on the preceding evening Valentin had opposed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had
refused to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wound was dangerous. But after his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) interview with
the curé he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had consented, and a telegram had been dispatched to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
mother. <div class="bookquote">``But the marquise had better hurry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman's conductor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's an abominable affair!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That's all I have
to say!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To say this, at least, in a tone of infinite disgust was an
irresistible need.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you don't approve?''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) conductor, with curious
urbanity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Approve?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I wish that when I had him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) there, night before
last, I had locked him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) up in my _cabinet de toilette!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin's late second opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head up and down
two or three times, gravely, with a little flute-like whistle. But they
had reached the inn, and a stout maid-servant in a night-cap was at the
door with a lantern, to take Newman's traveling-bag from the porter who
trudged behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Valentin was lodged on the ground-floor at the back
of the house, and Newman's companion went along a stone-faced passage
and softly opened a door. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) beckoned to Newman, who advanced
and looked into the room, which was lighted by a single shaded candle.
Beside the fire sat M. de Grosjoyaux asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) dressing-gown--a
little plump, fair man whom Newman had seen several times in Valentin's
company. On the bed lay Valentin, pale and still, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes
closed--a figure very shocking to Newman, who had seen it hitherto awake
to its fingertips. M. de Grosjoyaux's colleague pointed to an open door
beyond, and whispered that the doctor was within, keeping guard. So
long as Valentin slept, or seemed to sleep, of course Newman could not
approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); so our hero withdrew for the present, committing
himself to the care of the half-waked _bonne_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to a room
above-stairs, and introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to a bed on which a magnified bolster,
in yellow calico, figured as a counterpane. Newman lay down, and, in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) counterpane, slept for three or four hours. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) awoke,
the morning was advanced and the sun was filling his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) window, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
heard, outside of it, the clucking of hens. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was dressing there
came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) door a messenger from M. de Grosjoyaux and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) companion
proposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) should breakfast with them. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) went
downstairs to the little stone-paved dining-room, where the
maid-servant, who had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) night-cap, was serving the repast.
M. de Grosjoyaux was there, surprisingly fresh for a gentleman who had
been playing sick-nurse half the night, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) hands and watching
the breakfast table attentively. Newman renewed acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>),
and learned that Valentin was still sleeping; the surgeon, who had had
a fairly tranquil night, was at present sitting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). Before M. de
Grosjoyaux's associate reappeared, Newman learned that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) name was M.
Ledoux, and that Bellegarde's acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dated from the days
when they served together in the Pontifical Zouaves. M. Ledoux was the
nephew of a distinguished Ultramontane bishop. At last the bishop's
nephew came in with a toilet in which an ingenious attempt at harmony
with the peculiar situation was visible, and with a gravity tempered by
a decent deference to the best breakfast that the Croix Helvétique
had ever set forth. Valentin's servant, who was allowed only in scanty
measure the honor of watching with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) master, had been lending a light
Parisian hand in the kitchen. The two Frenchmen did their best to prove
that if circumstances might overshadow, they could not really obscure,
the national talent for conversation, and M. Ledoux delivered a neat
little eulogy on poor Bellegarde, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) pronounced the most charming
Englishman he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had ever known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) an Englishman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/>M. Ledoux smiled a moment and then made an epigram. _<div class="bookquote">``C’est plus qu’un
Anglais--c’est un Anglomane!'' (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>_ Newman said soberly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never
noticed it; and M. de Grosjoyaux remarked that it was really too soon
to deliver a funeral oration upon poor Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``Evidently,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Ledoux/Ledoux</b></font>)</div>said M.
Ledoux. <div class="bookquote">``But I couldn't help observing this morning to Mr. Newman that
when a man has taken such excellent measures for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) salvation as our
dear friend did last evening, it seems almost a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should put it in
peril again by returning to the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Ledoux/Ledoux</b></font>)</div>M. Ledoux was a great Catholic,
and Newman thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a queer mixture. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) countenance, by daylight,
had a sort of amiably saturnine cast; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a very large thin nose,
and looked like a Spanish picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appeared to think dueling a very
perfect arrangement, provided, if one should get hit, one could promptly
see the priest. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) seemed to take a great satisfaction in Valentin's
interview with the curé, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) conversation did not at all
indicate a sanctimonious habit of mind. M. Ledoux had evidently a high
sense of the becoming, and was prepared to be urbane and tasteful on all
points. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) was always furnished with a smile -LRB-which pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) moustache
up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) nose-RRB- and an explanation. _Savoir-vivre_--knowing how to
live--was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) specialty, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) included knowing how to die; but,
as Newman reflected, with a good deal of dumb irritation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed
disposed to delegate to others the application of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) learning on this
latter point. M. de Grosjoyaux was of quite another complexion, and
appeared to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) friend's theological unction as the sign of an
inaccessibly superior mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) was evidently doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) utmost, with a
kind of jovial tenderness, to make life agreeable to Valentin to the
last, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) as little as possible to miss the Boulevard des
Italiens; but what chiefly occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) mind was the mystery of a
bungling brewer's son making so neat a shot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) himself could snuff a
candle, etc., and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) could not have done better
than this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hastened to add that on the present occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would have
made a point of not doing so well. It was not an occasion for that sort
of murderous work, _que diable!_ He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would have picked out some quiet
fleshy spot and just tapped it with a harmless ball. M. Stanislas Kapp
had been deplorably heavy-handed; but really, when the world had come to
that pass that one granted a meeting to a brewer's son!... This was M.
de Grosjoyaux's nearest approach to a generalization. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grosjoyaux</b></font>) kept looking
through the window, over the shoulder of M. Ledoux, at a slender tree
which stood at the end of a lane, opposite to the inn, and seemed to be
measuring its distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) extended arm and secretly wishing that,
since the subject had been introduced, propriety did not forbid a little
speculative pistol-practice.

<p/>Newman was in no humor to enjoy good company. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could neither eat nor
talk; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) soul was sore with grief and anger, and the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
double sorrow was intolerable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
plate, counting the minutes, wishing at one moment that Valentin would
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) free to go in quest of Madame de Cintré and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
lost happiness, and mentally calling himself a vile brute the next, for
the impatient egotism of the wish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was very poor company, himself,
and even his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) acute preoccupation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) general lack of the habit of
pondering the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) produced did not prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) from reflecting
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) companions must be puzzled to see how poor Bellegarde came to
take such a fancy to this taciturn Yankee that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) must needs have him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) death-bed. After breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) strolled forth alone into the village
and looked at the fountain, the geese, the open barn doors, the brown,
bent old women, showing their hugely darned stocking-heels at the ends
of their slowly-clicking sabots, and the beautiful view of snowy
Alps and purple Jura at either end of the little street. The day was
brilliant; early spring was in the air and in the sunshine, and the
winter's damp was trickling out of the cottage eaves. It was birth
and brightness for all nature, even for chirping chickens and waddling
goslings, and it was to be death and burial for poor, foolish, generous,
delightful Bellegarde. Newman walked as far as the village church, and
went into the small graveyard beside it, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat down and looked at
the awkward tablets which were planted around. They were all sordid and
hideous, and Newman could feel nothing but the hardness and coldness
of death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up and came back to the inn, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found M. Ledoux
having coffee and a cigarette at a little green table which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) had
caused to be carried into the small garden. Newman, learning that the
doctor was still sitting with Valentin, asked M. Ledoux if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) might not
be allowed to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) had a great desire to be useful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>)
poor friend. This was easily arranged; the doctor was very glad to go
to bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a youthful and rather jaunty practitioner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a
clever face, and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) buttonhole;
Newman listened attentively to the instructions he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) before
retiring, and took mechanically from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand a small volume which the
surgeon recommended as a help to wakefulness, and which turned out to be
an old copy of <div class="bookquote">``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the surgeon</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin was still lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes closed, and there was no visible
change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) condition. Newman sat down near him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and for a long time
narrowly watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes wandered away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own situation, and rested upon the chain of the Alps, disclosed by
the drawing of the scant white cotton curtain of the window, through
which the sunshine passed and lay in squares upon the red-tiled floor.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tried to interweave his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reflections with hope, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) only half
succeeded. What had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to have, in its violence and
audacity, the force of a real calamity--the strength and insolence of
Destiny herself. It was unnatural and monstrous, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no arms
against it. At last a sound struck upon the stillness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard
Valentin's voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be about _me_ you are pulling that long face!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned, that Valentin was lying in the same position; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes
were open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was even trying to smile. It was with a very slender
strength that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) returned the pressure of Newman's hand. <div class="bookquote">``I have been
watching you for a quarter of an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin went on; <div class="bookquote">``you have been
looking as black as thunder. You are greatly disgusted with me, I see.
Well, of course! So am I!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shall not scold you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I feel too badly. And how are
you getting on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm getting off! They have quite settled that; haven't they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's for you to settle; you can get well if you try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman,
with resolute cheerfulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, how can I try? Trying is violent exercise, and that
sort of thing isn't in order for a man with a hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side as big as
your hat, that begins to bleed if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moves a hair's-breadth. I knew you
would come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``I knew I should wake up and find you here;
so I'm not surprised. But last night I was very impatient. I didn't see
how I could keep still until you came. It was a matter of keeping still,
just like this; as still as a mummy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case. You talk about trying;
I tried that! Well, here I am yet--these twenty hours. It seems like
twenty days.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Bellegarde talked slowly and feebly, but distinctly
enough. It was visible, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was in extreme pain, and at
last he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eyes. Newman begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to remain silent and spare
himself; the doctor had left urgent orders. <div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin, <div class="bookquote">``let us
eat and drink, for to-morrow--to-morrow'' (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) paused again. <div class="bookquote">``No, not
to-morrow, perhaps, but to-day. I can't eat and drink, but I can talk.
What's to be gained, at this pass, by renun--renunciation? I mustn't use
such big words. I was always a chatterer; Lord, how I have talked in my
day!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a reason for keeping quiet now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``We know how well
you talk, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Valentin, without heeding him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), went on in the same weak, dying
drawl. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to see you because you have seen my sister. Does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
know--will she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) come?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, by this time she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Didn't you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin asked. And then, in a moment, <div class="bookquote">``Didn't
you bring me any message from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes rested upon Newman's with a
certain soft keenness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) after I got your telegram,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I wrote to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sent you no answer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was obliged to reply that Madame de Cintré had left Paris. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
went yesterday to Fleurières.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday--to Fleurières? Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) go to Fleurières? What day is
this? What day was yesterday? Ah, then I shan't see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin
sadly. <div class="bookquote">``Fleurières is too far!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes again.
Newman sat silent, summoning pious invention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) aid, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
relieved at finding that Valentin was apparently too weak to reason
or to be curious. Bellegarde, however, presently went on. <div class="bookquote">``And my
mother--and my brother--will they come? Are they at Fleurières?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They were in Paris, but I didn't see them, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered.
<div class="bookquote">``If they received your telegram in time, they will have started this
morning. Otherwise they will be obliged to wait for the night-express,
and they will arrive at the same hour as I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They won't thank me--they won't thank me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin murmured. <div class="bookquote">``They
will pass an atrocious night, and Urbain doesn't like the early
morning air. I don't remember ever in my life to have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) before
noon--before breakfast. No one ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>). We don't know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) is
then. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)'s different. Who knows? Posterity, perhaps, will
know. That's the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) works, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) _cabinet_, at the history of the
Princesses. But I had to send for them--hadn't I? And then I want to
see my mother sit there where you sit, and say good-bye to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Perhaps,
after all, I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will have some surprise for me.
Don't think you know her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) yet, yourself; perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may surprise _you_.
But if I can't see Claire, I don't care for anything. I have been
thinking of it--and in my dreams, too. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) go to Fleurières
to-day? She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) never told me. What has happened? Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) ought to have
guessed I was here--this way. It is the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) ever
disappointed me. Poor Claire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know we are not man and wife quite yet,--your sister and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) doesn't yet account to me for all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) actions.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, after
a fashion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) smiled.

<p/>Valentin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Have you quarreled?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never, never!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How happily you say that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``You are going to be
happy--_va!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>In answer to this stroke of irony, none the less powerful
for being so unconscious, all poor Newman could do was to give a
helpless and transparent stare. Valentin continued to fix him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
own rather over-bright gaze, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``But something _is_
the matter with you. I watched you just now; you haven't a bridegroom's
face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``how can I show _you_ a bridegroom's
face? If you think I enjoy seeing you lie there and not being able to
help you'' (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are just the man to be cheerful; don't forfeit your rights!
I'm a proof of your wisdom. When was a man ever gloomy when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
say, `I told you so?' You told me so, you know. You did what you could
about it. You said some very good things; I have thought them over. But,
my dear friend, I was right, all the same. This is the regular way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't do what I ought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have done something
else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For instance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, something or other. I ought to have treated you as a small boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm a very small boy, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``I'm rather less than
an infant. An infant is helpless, but it's generally voted promising.
I'm not promising, eh? Society can't lose a less valuable member.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was strongly moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) back upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend
and walked away to the window, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood looking out, but only
vaguely seeing. <div class="bookquote">``No, I don't like the look of your back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin
continued. <div class="bookquote">``I have always been an observer of backs; yours is quite out
of sorts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bedside and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to be quiet. <div class="bookquote">``Be quiet and
get well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``That's what you must do. Get well and help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you you were in trouble! How can I help you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll let you know when you are better. You were always curious; there
is something to get well for!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, with resolute animation.

<p/>Valentin closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes and lay a long time without speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) seemed
even to have fallen asleep. But at the end of half an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) began to
talk again. <div class="bookquote">``I am rather sorry about that place in the bank. Who knows
but that I might have become another Rothschild? But I wasn't meant for
a banker; bankers are not so easy to kill. Don't you think I have
been very easy to kill? It's not like a serious man. It's really very
mortifying. It's like telling your hostess you must go, when you count
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) begging you to stay, and then finding she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) does no such thing.
`Really--so soon? You've only just come!' Life doesn't make me any such
polite little speech.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman for some time said nothing, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) broke out. <div class="bookquote">``It's a bad
case--it's a bad case--it's the worst case I ever met. I don't want
to say anything unpleasant, but I can't help it. I've seen men dying
before--and I've seen men shot. But it always seemed more natural; they
were not so clever as you. Damnation--damnation! You might have done
something better than this. It's about the meanest winding-up of a man's
affairs that I can imagine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin feebly waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand to and fro. <div class="bookquote">``Don't insist--don't insist!
It is mean--decidedly mean. For you see at the bottom--down at the
bottom, in a little place as small as the end of a wine funnel--I agree
with you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><p/>A few moments after this the doctor put his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head through the half-opened
door and, perceiving that Valentin was awake, came in and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
pulse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had talked too much--ten
times too much. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin; <div class="bookquote">``a man sentenced to death can
never talk too much. Have you never read an account of an execution in
a newspaper? Don't they always set a lot of people at the
prisoner--lawyers, reporters, priests--to make him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) talk? But it's not
Mr. Newman's fault; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sits there as mum as a death's-head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor observed that it was time his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) patient's wound should be
dressed again; MM. de Grosjoyaux and Ledoux, who had already witnessed
this delicate operation, taking Newman's place as assistants. Newman
withdrew and learned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fellow-watchers that they had received a
telegram from Urbain de Bellegarde to the effect that their message had
been delivered in the Rue de l’Université too late to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to
take the morning train, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would start with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mother in the
evening. Newman wandered away into the village again, and walked about
restlessly for two or three hours. The day seemed terribly long. At dusk
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came back and dined with the doctor and M. Ledoux. The dressing of
Valentin's wound had been a very critical operation; the doctor didn't
really see how he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was to endure a repetition of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) then declared
that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must beg of Mr. Newman to deny himself for the present the
satisfaction of sitting with M. de Bellegarde; more than anyone else,
apparently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had the flattering but inconvenient privilege of exciting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). M. Ledoux, at this, swallowed a glass of wine in silence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) must
have been wondering what the deuce Bellegarde found so exciting in the
American.

<p/>Newman, after dinner, went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat for a long time
staring at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lighted candle, and thinking that Valentin was dying
downstairs. Late, when the candle had burnt low, there came a soft rap
at his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) door. The doctor stood there with a candlestick and a shrug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) must amuse himself still!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>said Valentin's medical adviser. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
insists upon seeing you, and I am afraid you must come. I think at this
rate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) will hardly outlast the night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman went back to Valentin's room, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found lighted by a taper
on the hearth. Valentin begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) to light a candle. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see
your face,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They say you excite me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) went on, as Newman
complied with this request, <div class="bookquote">``and I confess I do feel excited. But it
isn't you--it's my own thoughts. I have been thinking--thinking. Sit
down there and let me look at you again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman seated himself, folded
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms, and bent a heavy gaze upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to be playing
a part, mechanically, in a lugubrious comedy. Valentin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) for
some time. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, this morning I was right; you have something on your
mind heavier than Valentin de Bellegarde. Come, I'm a dying man and it's
indecent to deceive me. Something happened after I left Paris. It was
not for nothing that my sister started off at this season of the year
for Fleurières. Why was it? It sticks in my crop. I have been thinking
it over, and if you don't tell me I shall guess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had better not tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It won't do you any good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you think it will do me any good not to tell me, you are very much
mistaken. There is trouble about your marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``There is trouble about my marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>And Valentin was silent again. <div class="bookquote">``They have stopped it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have stopped it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had spoken out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
found a satisfaction in it which deepened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Your mother
and brother have broken faith. They have decided that it can't take
place. They have decided that I am not good enough, after all. They have
taken back their word. Since you insist, there it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin gave a sort of groan, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hands a moment, and then let
them drop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry not to have anything better to tell you about them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman
pursued. <div class="bookquote">``But it's not my fault. I was, indeed, very unhappy when your
telegram reached me; I was quite upside down. You may imagine whether I
feel any better now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin moaned gaspingly, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wound were throbbing. <div class="bookquote">``Broken
faith, broken faith!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``And my sister--my sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister is very unhappy; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has consented to give me up. I don't
know why. I don't know what they have done to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); it must be something
pretty bad. In justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) you ought to know it. They have made
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) suffer. I haven't seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) alone, but only before them! We had an
interview yesterday morning. They came out flat, in so many words. They
told me to go about my business. It seems to me a very bad case. I'm
angry, I'm sore, I'm sick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin lay there staring, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes more brilliantly lighted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
lips soundlessly parted, and a flush of color in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) pale face. Newman
had never before uttered so many words in the plaintive key, but now,
in speaking to Valentin in the poor fellow's extremity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had a feeling
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) complaint somewhere within the presence of the
power that men pray to in trouble; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) outgush of resentment as
a sort of spiritual privilege.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Claire,'' (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>--said Bellegarde,--<div class="bookquote">``Claire? She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) has given you up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't really believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Don't believe it, don't believe it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) is gaining time; excuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Claire!''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>murmured Valentin. <div class="bookquote">``But they--but they'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused
again. <div class="bookquote">``You saw them; they dismissed you, face to face?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Face to face. They were very explicit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What did they say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They said they couldn't stand a commercial person.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand and laid it upon Newman's arm. <div class="bookquote">``And about
their promise--their engagement with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They made a distinction. They said it was to hold good only until
Madame de Cintré accepted me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>Valentin lay staring a while, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) flush died away. <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me
any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I'm ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You? You are the soul of honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman simply.

<p/>Valentin groaned and turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) head. For some time nothing more
was said. Then Valentin turned back again and found a certain force to
press Newman's arm. <div class="bookquote">``It's very bad--very bad. When my people--when
my race--come to that, it is time for me to withdraw. I believe in
my sister; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will explain. Excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can't--if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can't,
forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has suffered. But for the others it is very bad--very
bad. You take it very hard? No, it's a shame to make you say so.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes and again there was a silence. Newman felt almost awed;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had evoked a more solemn spirit than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) expected. Presently Valentin
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) again, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">``I apologize,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Do you understand? Here on my death-bed. I apologize for
my family. For my mother. For my brother. For the ancient house of
Bellegarde. _Voilà!_''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) added softly.

<p/>Newman for an answer took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand and pressed it with a world of
kindness. Valentin remained quiet, and at the end of half an hour the
doctor softly came in. Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), through the half-open door, Newman
saw the two questioning faces of MM. de Grosjoyaux and Ledoux. The
doctor laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on Valentin's wrist and sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) gave
no sign and the two gentlemen came in, M. Ledoux having first beckoned
to someone outside. This was M. le Curé, who carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>Curé</b></font>) hand an
object unknown to Newman, and covered with a white napkin. M. le Curé
was short, round, and red: he (<font color='blue'><b>Curé</b></font>) advanced, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Curé</b></font>) little black cap
to Newman, and deposited his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) burden on the table; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat down
in the best armchair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands folded across his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) person. The other
gentlemen had exchanged glances which expressed unanimity as to the
timeliness of their presence. But for a long time Valentin neither spoke
nor moved. It was Newman's belief, afterwards, that M. le Curé went to
sleep. At last abruptly, Valentin pronounced Newman's name. His (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) friend
went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said in French, <div class="bookquote">``You are not alone. I want to speak
to you alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div>Newman looked at the doctor, and the doctor looked at
the curé, who looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); and then the doctor and the curé,
together, gave a shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Alone--for five minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>Valentin repeated.
<div class="bookquote">``Please leave us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The curé</b></font>)</div><p/>The curé took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) burden again and led the way out, followed by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) companions. Newman closed the door behind them and came back to
Valentin's bedside. Bellegarde had watched all this intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's very bad, it's very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said, after Newman had seated himself
close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The more I think of it the worse it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't think of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>But Valentin went on, without heeding him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Even if they should come
round again, the shame--the baseness--is there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they won't come round!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can make them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you something--a great secret--an immense secret. You can
use it against them--frighten them, force them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A secret!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman repeated. The idea of letting Valentin, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
death-bed, confide him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) an <div class="bookquote">``immense secret''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), for the
moment, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) draw back. It seemed an illicit way of arriving at
information, and even had a vague analogy with listening at a keyhole.
Then, suddenly, the thought of <div class="bookquote">``forcing''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
son became attractive, and Newman bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head closer to Valentin's
lips. For some time, however, the dying man said nothing more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) only
lay and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) friend with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) kindled, expanded, troubled eye,
and Newman began to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had spoken in delirium. But at last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was something done--something done at Fleurières. It was foul
play. My father--something happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I don't know; I have been
ashamed--afraid to know. But I know there is something. My mother
knows--Urbain knows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something happened to your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, urgently.

<p/>Valentin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), still more wide-eyed. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) didn't get well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get well of what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>But the immense effort which Valentin had made, first to decide to utter
these words and then to bring them out, appeared to have taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) last
strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) lapsed again into silence, and Newman sat watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do
you understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) began again, presently. <div class="bookquote">``At Fleurières. You can find
out. Mrs. Bread knows. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) I begged you to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Then tell
them that, and see. It may help you. If not, tell everyone. It will--it
will'' (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>--here Valentin's voice sank to the feeblest murmur--<div class="bookquote">``it will
avenge you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div><p/>The words died away in a long, soft groan. Newman stood up, deeply
impressed, not knowing what to say; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart was beating violently.
<div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged.''  (<font color='red'><b>Valentin/Mr. Valentin</b></font>)</div>But Valentin seemed
not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) remained silent, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) silence continued. At last
Newman went and opened the door. M. le Curé re-entered, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
sacred vessel and followed by the three gentlemen and by Valentin's
servant. It was almost processional.



<p/>CHAPTER XX

<p/>Valentin de Bellegarde died tranquilly, just as the cold faint March
dawn began to illumine the faces of the little knot of friends gathered
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) bedside. An hour afterwards Newman left the inn and drove
to Geneva; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was naturally unwilling to be present at the arrival of
Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) first-born. At Geneva, for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
remained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was like a man who has had a fall and wants to sit still
and count his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) bruises. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) instantly wrote to Madame de Cintré,
relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) brother's death--with certain
exceptions--and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) what was the earliest moment at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
might hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would consent to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). M. Ledoux had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ledoux</b></font>) had reason to know that Valentin's will--Bellegarde had a great
deal of elegant personal property to dispose of--contained a request
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) should be buried near his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) father in the churchyard of
Fleurières, and Newman intended that the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own relations with
the family should not deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of the satisfaction of helping to pay
the last earthly honors to the best fellow in the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reflected
that Valentin's friendship was older than Urbain's enmity, and that at
a funeral it was easy to escape notice. Madame de Cintré's answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
letter enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) to time his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) arrival at Fleurières. This answer was
very brief; it ran as follows:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you for your letter, and for your being with Valentin. It is
a most inexpressible sorrow to me that I was not. To see you will be
nothing but a distress to me; there is no need, therefore, to wait for
what you call brighter days. It is all one now, and I shall have no
brighter days. Come when you please; only notify me first. My brother is
to be buried here on Friday, and my family is to remain here. C. de C.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) received this letter Newman went straight to Paris and to
Poitiers. The journey took him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) far southward, through green Touraine
and across the far-shining Loire, into a country where the early spring
deepened about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had never made a journey during
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heeded less what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have called the lay of the land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
obtained lodging at the inn at Poitiers, and the next morning drove in
a couple of hours to the village of Fleurières. But here, preoccupied
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could not fail to notice the picturesqueness of the
place. It was what the French call a _petit bourg_; it lay at the base
of a sort of huge mound on the summit of which stood the crumbling ruins
of a feudal castle, much of whose sturdy material, as well as that of
the wall which dropped along the hill to enclose the clustered houses
defensively, had been absorbed into the very substance of the village.
The church was simply the former chapel of the castle, fronting upon its
grass-grown court, which, however, was of generous enough width to
have given up its quaintest corner to a little graveyard. Here the very
headstones themselves seemed to sleep, as they slanted into the grass;
the patient elbow of the rampart held them together on one side, and in
front, far beneath their mossy lids, the green plains and blue distances
stretched away. The way to church, up the hill, was impracticable to
vehicles. It was lined with peasants, two or three rows deep, who stood
watching old Madame de Bellegarde slowly ascend it, on the arm of her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
elder son, behind the pall-bearers of the other. Newman chose to lurk
among the common mourners who murmured <div class="bookquote">``Madame la Comtesse''  (<font color='red'><b>the mourners</b></font>)</div>as a tall
figure veiled in black passed before them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood in the dusky little
church while the service was going forward, but at the dismal tomb-side
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away and walked down the hill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went back to Poitiers,
and spent two days in which patience and impatience were singularly
commingled. On the third day he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sent Madame de Cintré a note, saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) in the afternoon, and in accordance with
this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way to Fleurières. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) vehicle at the
tavern in the village street, and obeyed the simple instructions which
were given him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for finding the château.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just beyond there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, and pointed to the
tree-tops of the park, above the opposite houses. Newman followed the
first cross-road to the right--it was bordered with mouldy cottages--and
in a few moments saw before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) the peaked roofs of the towers.
Advancing farther, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found himself before a vast iron gate, rusty and
closed; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused a moment, looking through the bars. The château
was near the road; this was at once its merit and its defect; but its
aspect was extremely impressive. Newman learned afterwards, from a
guide-book of the province, that it dated from the time of Henry IV. It
presented to the wide, paved area which preceded it and which was edged
with shabby farm-buildings an immense façade of dark time-stained
brick, flanked by two low wings, each of which terminated in a little
Dutch-looking pavilion capped with a fantastic roof. Two towers rose
behind, and behind the towers was a mass of elms and beeches, now just
faintly green.

<p/>But the great feature was a wide, green river which washed the
foundations of the château. The building rose from an island in the
circling stream, so that this formed a perfect moat spanned by a
two-arched bridge without a parapet. The dull brick walls, which here
and there made a grand, straight sweep; the ugly little cupolas of the
wings, the deep-set windows, the long, steep pinnacles of mossy slate,
all mirrored themselves in the tranquil river. Newman rang at the gate,
and was almost frightened at the tone with which a big rusty bell above
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head replied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). An old woman came out from the gate-house and
opened the creaking portal just wide enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to pass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went
in, across the dry, bare court and the little cracked white slabs of
the causeway on the moat. At the door of the château he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waited for some
moments, and this gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a chance to observe that Fleurières was not
<div class="bookquote">``kept up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fleurières</b></font>)</div>and to reflect that it was a melancholy place of residence.
<div class="bookquote">``It looks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman to himself--and I give the comparison for what
it is worth--<div class="bookquote">``like a Chinese penitentiary.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At last the door was opened
by a servant whom he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) remembered to have seen in the Rue de l’Université.
The man's dull face brightened as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) perceived our hero, for Newman, for
indefinable reasons, enjoyed the confidence of the liveried gentry. The
footman led the way across a great central vestibule, with a pyramid of
plants in tubs in the middle of glass doors all around, to what appeared
to be the principal drawing-room of the château. Newman crossed the
threshold of a room of superb proportions, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feel at first
like a tourist with a guide-book and a cicerone awaiting a fee. But when
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) guide had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) alone, with the observation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would call
Madame la Comtesse, Newman perceived that the salon contained little
that was remarkable save a dark ceiling with curiously carved rafters,
some curtains of elaborate, antiquated tapestry, and a dark oaken floor,
polished like a mirror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waited some minutes, walking up and down; but
at length, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned at the end of the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw that Madame de
Cintré had come in by a distant door. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) wore a black dress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). As the length of the immense room lay between them
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had time to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) before they met in the middle of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was dismayed at the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) appearance. Pale, heavy-browed,
almost haggard with a sort of monastic rigidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) had
little but her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) pure features in common with the woman whose radiant good
grace he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had hitherto admired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) eyes rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hand; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) eyes looked like two rainy autumn moons,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) touch was portentously lifeless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was at your brother's funeral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said. <div class="bookquote">``Then I waited three
days. But I could wait no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing can be lost or gained by waiting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``But
it was very considerate of you to wait, wronged as you have been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you think I have been wronged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with that
oddly humorous accent with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) often uttered words of the gravest
meaning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I need to say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I have wronged,
seriously, many persons; certainly not consciously. To you, to whom I
have done this hard and cruel thing, the only reparation I can make is
to say, `I know it, I feel it!' The reparation is pitifully small!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it's a great step forward!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with a gracious smile of
encouragement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pushed a chair towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) and held it, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
urgently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) sat down, mechanically, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seated himself near
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>); but in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up, restlessly, and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
remained seated, like a troubled creature who had passed through the
stage of restlessness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say nothing is to be gained by my seeing you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and yet
I am very glad you came. Now I can tell you what I feel. It is a selfish
pleasure, but it is one of the last I shall have.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) paused, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) great misty eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know how I have deceived and
injured you; I know how cruel and cowardly I have been. I see it
as vividly as you do--I feel it to the ends of my fingers.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
unclasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hands, which were locked together in her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) lap, lifted them,
and dropped them at her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) side. <div class="bookquote">``Anything that you may have said of me in
your angriest passion is nothing to what I have said to myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my angriest passion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I have said nothing hard of
you. The very worst thing I have said of you yet is that you are the
loveliest of women.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seated himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) again abruptly.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) flushed a little, but even her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) flush was pale. <div class="bookquote">``That is because you
think I will come back. But I will not come back. It is in that hope
you have come here, I know; I am very sorry for you. I would do almost
anything for you. To say that, after what I have done, seems simply
impudent; but what can I say that will not seem impudent? To wrong you
and apologize--that is easy enough. I should not have wronged you.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
stopped a moment, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and motioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) go on.
<div class="bookquote">``I ought never to have listened to you at first; that was the wrong.
No good could come of it. I felt it, and yet I listened; that was your
fault. I liked you too much; I believed in you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And don't you believe in me now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than ever. But now it doesn't matter. I have given you up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman gave a powerful thump with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) clenched fist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``Why,
why, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Give me a reason--a decent reason. You are not a
child--you are not a minor, nor an idiot. You are not obliged to drop me
because your mother told you to. Such a reason isn't worthy of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that; it's not worthy of me. But it's the only one I have to
give. After all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, throwing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``think
me an idiot and forget me! That will be the simplest way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman got up and walked away with a crushing sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cause was
lost, and yet with an equal inability to give up fighting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to
one of the great windows, and looked out at the stiffly embanked river
and the formal gardens which lay beyond it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned round, Madame
de Cintré had risen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) stood there silent and passive. <div class="bookquote">``You are not
frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``you are not honest. Instead of saying that you are
imbecile, you should say that other people are wicked. Your mother and
your brother have been false and cruel; they have been so to me, and I
am sure they have been so to you. Why do you try to shield them? Why do
you sacrifice me to them? I'm not false; I'm not cruel. You don't know
what you give up; I can tell you that--you don't. They bully you and
plot about you; and I--I'' (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>--And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
turned away and began to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You told me the other day that
you were afraid of your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What did you
mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I remember; I was sorry afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were sorry when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came down and put on the thumbscrews. In God's
name what _is_ it she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing. Nothing that you can understand. And now that I have given you
up, I must not complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's no reasoning!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Complain of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), on the contrary.
Tell me all about it, frankly and trustfully, as you ought, and we will
talk it over so satisfactorily that you won't give me up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré looked down some moments, fixedly; and then, raising
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``One good at least has come of this: I have made
you judge me more fairly. You thought of me in a way that did me great
honor; I don't know why you had taken it into your head. But it left me
no loophole for escape--no chance to be the common, weak creature I am.
It was not my fault; I warned you from the first. But I ought to have
warned you more. I ought to have convinced you that I was doomed to
disappoint you. But I _was_, in a way, too proud. You see what my
superiority amounts to, I hope!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) went on, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) voice with
a tremor which even then and there Newman thought beautiful. <div class="bookquote">``I am too
proud to be honest, I am not too proud to be faithless. I am timid and
cold and selfish. I am afraid of being uncomfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you call marrying me uncomfortable!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman staring.

<p/>Madame de Cintré blushed a little and seemed to say that if begging his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
pardon in words was impudent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) might at least thus mutely express
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) perfect comprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) conduct odious. <div class="bookquote">``It is not
marrying you; it is doing all that would go with it. It's the rupture,
the defiance, the insisting upon being happy in my own way. What right
have I to be happy when--when'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--And she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When others have been most unhappy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What others?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked. <div class="bookquote">``What have you to do with any others but
me? Besides you said just now that you wanted happiness, and that you
should find it by obeying your mother. You contradict yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I contradict myself; that shows you that I am not even
intelligent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are laughing at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You are mocking me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) intently, and an observer might have said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) was
asking herself whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) might not most quickly end their common pain
by confessing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) was mocking him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No; I am not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) presently
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Granting that you are not intelligent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``that you are
weak, that you are common, that you are nothing that I have believed
you were--what I ask of you is not heroic effort, it is a very common
effort. There is a great deal on my side to make it easy. The simple
truth is that you don't care enough about me to make it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``I am as cold as that flowing
river.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman gave a great rap on the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stick, and a long, grim
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Good, good!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You go altogether too far--you overshoot
the mark. There isn't a woman in the world as bad as you would make
yourself out. I see your game; it's what I said. You are blackening
yourself to whiten others. You don't want to give me up, at all; you
like me--you like me. I know you do; you have shown it, and I have felt
it. After that, you may be as cold as you please! They have bullied you,
I say; they have tortured you. It's an outrage, and I insist upon saving
you from the extravagance of your own generosity. Would you chop off
your hand if your mother requested it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré looked a little frightened. <div class="bookquote">``I spoke of my mother
too blindly, the other day. I am my own mistress, by law and by her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
approval. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) can do nothing to me; she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has done nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has never
alluded to those hard words I used about her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has made you feel them, I'll promise you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's my conscience that makes me feel them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your conscience seems to me to be rather mixed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman,
passionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been in great trouble, but now it is very clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame
de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``I don't give you up for any worldly advantage or for any
worldly happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you don't give me up for Lord Deepmere, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I
won't pretend, even to provoke you, that I think that. But that's what
your mother and your brother wanted, and your mother, at that villainous
ball of hers--I liked it at the time, but the very thought of it now
makes me rabid--tried to push him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) on to make up to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who told you this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not Valentin. I observed it. I guessed it. I didn't know at the time
that I was observing it, but it stuck in my memory. And afterwards, you
recollect, I saw Lord Deepmere with you in the conservatory. You said
then that you would tell me at another time what he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) had said to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was before--before _this_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``and, besides, I think I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>)'s an
honest little Englishman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) came and told you what your mother was up
to--that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) to supplant me; not being a commercial person.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) would make you an offer she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would undertake to bring you over and
give me the slip. Lord Deepmere isn't very intellectual, so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had to
spell it out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) admired you `no end,' and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) wanted
you to know it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) didn't like being mixed up with that sort of
underhand work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) came to you and told tales. That was about the
amount of it, wasn't it? And then you said you were perfectly happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see why we should talk of Lord Deepmere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``It was not for that you came here. And about my mother, it
doesn't matter what you suspect and what you know. When once my mind
has been made up, as it is now, I should not discuss these things.
Discussing anything, now, is very idle. We must try and live each as we
can. I believe you will be happy again; even, sometimes, when you think
of me. When you do so, think this--that it was not easy, and that I did
the best I could. I have things to reckon with that you don't know. I
mean I have feelings. I must do as they force me--I must, I must. They
would haunt me otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) cried, with vehemence; <div class="bookquote">``they would kill
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what your feelings are: they are superstitions! They are the
feeling that, after all, though I _am_ a good fellow, I have been
in business; the feeling that your mother's looks are law and your
brother's words are gospel; that you all hang together, and that it's
a part of the everlasting proprieties that they should have a hand
in everything you do. It makes my blood boil. That _is_ cold; you are
right. And what I feel here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>and Newman struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart and became
more poetical than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew, <div class="bookquote">``is a glowing fire!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A spectator less preoccupied than Madame de Cintré's distracted wooer
would have felt sure from the first that her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) appealing calm of manner
was the result of violent effort, in spite of which the tide of
agitation was rapidly rising. On these last words of Newman's it
overflowed, though at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) spoke low, for fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) voice
betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No. I was not right--I am not cold! I believe that if I
am doing what seems so bad, it is not mere weakness and falseness. Mr.
Newman, it's like a religion. I can't tell you--I can't! It's cruel of
you to insist. I don't see why I shouldn't ask you to believe me--and
pity me. It's like a religion. There's a curse upon the house; I don't
know what--I don't know why--don't ask me. We must all bear it. I have
been too selfish; I wanted to escape from it. You offered me a great
chance--besides my liking you. It seemed good to change completely, to
break, to go away. And then I admired you. But I can't--it has overtaken
and come back to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) self-control had now completely abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) words were broken with long sobs. <div class="bookquote">``Why do such dreadful things
happen to us--why is my brother Valentin killed, like a beast in the
midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) youth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) gaiety and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) brightness and all that we
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) for? Why are there things I can't ask about--that I am afraid
to know? Why are there places I can't look at, sounds I can't hear?
Why is it given to me to choose, to decide, in a case so hard and so
terrible as this? I am not meant for that--I am not made for boldness
and defiance. I was made to be happy in a quiet, natural way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>At this
Newman gave a most expressive groan, but Madame de Cintré went on. <div class="bookquote">``I
was made to do gladly and gratefully what is expected of me. My mother
has always been very good to me; that's all I can say. I must not judge
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); I must not criticize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). If I did, it would come back to me. I
can't change!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, bitterly; <div class="bookquote">``_I_ must change--if I break in two in the
effort!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are different. You are a man; you will get over it. You have all
kinds of consolation. You were born--you were trained, to changes.
Besides--besides, I shall always think of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care for that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You are cruel--you are terribly
cruel. God forgive you! You may have the best reasons and the finest
feelings in the world; that makes no difference. You are a mystery to
me; I don't see how such hardness can go with such loveliness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Cintré fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) swimming eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You believe
I am hard, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) look, and then broke out, <div class="bookquote">``You are a perfect,
faultless creature! Stay by me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I am hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``Whenever we give pain we are hard.
And we _must_ give pain; that's the world,--the hateful, miserable
world! Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) gave a long, deep sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I can't even say I am glad
to have known you--though I am. That too is to wrong you. I can say
nothing that is not cruel. Therefore let us part, without more of this.
Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Newman stood and looked at it without taking it, and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt, himself, like shedding tears of rage. <div class="bookquote">``What are you
going to do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where I shall give no more pain and suspect no more evil. I am going
out of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Out of the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going into a convent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Into a convent!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman repeated the words with the deepest dismay;
it was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) was going into an hospital. <div class="bookquote">``Into a
convent--_you!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I told you that it was not for my worldly advantage or pleasure I was
leaving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>But still Newman hardly understood. <div class="bookquote">``You are going to be a nun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went
on, <div class="bookquote">``in a cell--for life--with a gown and white veil?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A nun--a Carmelite nun,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré. <div class="bookquote">``For life, with God's
leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The idea struck Newman as too dark and horrible for belief, and made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feel as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have done if she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) was going
to mutilate her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) beautiful face, or drink some potion that would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands and began to tremble, visibly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré, don't, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I beseech you! On my knees,
if you like, I'll beseech you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm, with a tender, pitying, almost
reassuring gesture. <div class="bookquote">``You don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You have wrong
ideas. It's nothing horrible. It is only peace and safety. It is to be
out of the world, where such troubles as this come to the innocent,
to the best. And for life--that's the blessing of it! They can't begin
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman dropped into a chair and sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) with a long,
inarticulate murmur. That this superb woman, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen all
human grace and household force, should turn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and all the
brightness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)--him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) future and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fortune and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fidelity--to muffle herself in ascetic rags and entomb herself in a
cell was a confounding combination of the inexorable and the grotesque.
As the image deepened before him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) the grotesque seemed to expand and
overspread it; it was a reduction to the absurd of the trial to which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was subjected. <div class="bookquote">``You--you a nun!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed; <div class="bookquote">``you with your beauty
defaced--you behind locks and bars! Never, never, if I can prevent it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feet with a violent laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't prevent it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Cintré, <div class="bookquote">``and it ought--a
little--to satisfy you. Do you suppose I will go on living in the world,
still beside you, and yet not with you? It is all arranged. Good-bye,
good-bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) hand, took it in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">``Forever?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) lips made an inaudible movement and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) own uttered a deep
imprecation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) eyes, as if with the pain of hearing it;
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) and clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) breast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) kissed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) white face; for an instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) resisted and for a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>)
submitted; then, with force, she (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>) disengaged herself and hurried away
over the long shining floor. The next moment the door closed behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Comtesse</b></font>).

<p/>Newman made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI

<p/>There is a pretty public walk at Poitiers, laid out upon the crest of
the high hill around which the little city clusters, planted with thick
trees and looking down upon the fertile fields in which the old English
princes fought for their right and held it. Newman paced up and down
this quiet promenade for the greater part of the next day and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
eyes wander over the historic prospect; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have been sadly
at a loss to tell you afterwards whether the latter was made up of
coal-fields or of vineyards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was wholly given up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) grievance,
of which reflection by no means diminished the weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feared that
Madame de Cintré was irretrievably lost; and yet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) would have
said himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) didn't see his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) way clear to giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) found
it impossible to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) back upon Fleurières and its inhabitants;
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) that some germ of hope or reparation must lurk there
somewhere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) could only stretch his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) arm out far enough to pluck
it. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) hand on a door-knob and were closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
clenched fist upon it: he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had thumped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had called, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had pressed
the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) powerful knee and shaken it with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) strength,
and dead, damning silence had answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>). And yet something held
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) there--something hardened the grasp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) fingers. Newman's
satisfaction had been too intense, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) whole plan too deliberate and
mature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) prospect of happiness too rich and comprehensive for this
fine moral fabric to crumble at a stroke. The very foundation seemed
fatally injured, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) felt a stubborn desire still to try to save
the edifice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was filled with a sorer sense of wrong than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had ever
known, or than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had supposed it possible he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) should know. To accept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) injury and walk away without looking behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was a stretch of
good-nature of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) found himself incapable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) looked behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
intently and continually, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) saw there did not assuage his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)
resentment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) saw himself trustful, generous, liberal, patient, easy,
pocketing frequent irritation and furnishing unlimited modesty. To have
eaten humble pie, to have been snubbed and patronized and satirized and
have consented to take it as one of the conditions of the bargain--to
have done this, and done it all for nothing, surely gave one a right to
protest. And to be turned off because one was a commercial person! As if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had ever talked or dreamt of the commercial since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) connection with
the Bellegardes began--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had made the least circumstance of the
commercial--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) would not have consented to confound the commercial
fifty times a day, if it might have increased by a hair's breadth the
chance of the Bellegardes' not playing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) a trick! Granted that being
commercial was fair ground for having a trick played upon one, how
little they knew about the class so designed and its enterprising way
of not standing upon trifles! It was in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) injury that the
weight of Newman's past endurance seemed so heavy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) actual irritation
had not been so great, merged as it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) vision of the cloudless
blue that overarched his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) immediate wooing. But now his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) sense of outrage
was deep, rancorous, and ever present; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was a good fellow
wronged. As for Madame de Cintré's conduct, it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) with a kind
of awe, and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was powerless to understand it or feel
the reality of its motives only deepened the force with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had
attached himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) had never let the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) Catholicism
trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>); Catholicism to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) was nothing but a name, and to express
a mistrust of the form in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) religious feelings had moulded
themselves would have seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) own part a rather pretentious
affectation of Protestant zeal. If such superb white flowers as that
could bloom in Catholic soil, the soil was not insalubrious. But it was
one thing to be a Catholic, and another to turn nun--on your hand!
There was something lugubriously comical in the way Newman's thoroughly
contemporaneous optimism was confronted with this dusky old-world
expedient. To see a woman made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and for motherhood to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
children juggled away in this tragic travesty--it was a thing to rub
one's eyes over, a nightmare, an illusion, a hoax. But the hours passed
away without disproving the thing, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) only the after-sense
of the vehemence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had embraced Madame de Cintré. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned them over and tried to
shake the mystery out of them and to infuse them with an endurable
meaning. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feeling being a kind of religion? It
was the religion simply of the family laws, the religion of which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
implacable little mother was the high priestess. Twist the thing about
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) generosity would, the one certain fact was that they had used
force against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) generosity had tried to screen them, but Newman's
heart rose into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) throat at the thought that they should go scot-free.

<p/>The twenty-four hours wore themselves away, and the next morning Newman
sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feet with the resolution to return to Fleurières and
demand another interview with Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
lost no time in putting it into practice. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) rolled swiftly over
the excellent road in the little calèche furnished him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) at the inn at
Poitiers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) drew forth, as it were, from the very safe place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
mind to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had consigned it, the last information given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) by
poor Valentin. Valentin had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) could do something with it, and
Newman thought it would be well to have it at hand. This was of course
not the first time, lately, that Newman had given it his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attention. It
was information in the rough,--it was dark and puzzling; but Newman was
neither helpless nor afraid. Valentin had evidently meant to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) in
possession of a powerful instrument, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) could not be said to
have placed the handle very securely within his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) grasp. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had not
really told him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) the secret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had at least given him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) the clew to it--a
clew of which that queer old Mrs. Bread held the other end. Mrs. Bread
had always looked to Newman as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew secrets; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) apparently
enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) esteem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might be induced to share her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
knowledge with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). So long as there was only Mrs. Bread to deal
with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt easy. As to what there was to find out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had only one
fear--that it might not be bad enough. Then, when the image of the
marquise and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) son rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) again, standing side by side,
the old woman's hand in Urbain's arm, and the same cold, unsociable
fixedness in the eyes of each, he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) cried out to himself that the fear was
groundless. There was blood in the secret at the very least! He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) arrived
at Fleurières almost in a state of elation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) had satisfied himself,
logically, that in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) threat of exposure they would, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) mentally phrased it, rattle down like unwound buckets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) remembered
indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) must first catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) hare--first ascertain what there was
to expose; but after that, why shouldn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) happiness be as good as new
again? Mother and son would drop their lovely victim in terror and take
to hiding, and Madame de Cintré, left to herself, would surely come back
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>). Give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) a chance and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would rise to the surface, return to
the light. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) fail to perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) house would be much
the most comfortable sort of convent?

<p/>Newman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had done before, left his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) conveyance at the inn and walked
the short remaining distance to the château. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reached the gate,
however, a singular feeling took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)--a feeling which,
strange as it may seem, had its source in its unfathomable good
nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood there a while, looking through the bars at the large,
time-stained face of the edifice, and wondering to what crime it was
that the dark old house, with its flowery name, had given convenient
occasion. It had given occasion, first and last, to tyrannies and
sufferings enough, Newman said to himself; it was an evil-looking
place to live in. Then, suddenly, came the reflection--What a horrible
rubbish-heap of iniquity to fumble in! The attitude of inquisitor turned
its ignobler face, and with the same movement Newman declared that
the Bellegardes should have another chance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would appeal once more
directly to their sense of fairness, and not to their fear, and if they
should be accessible to reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) need know nothing worse about them
than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) already knew. That was bad enough.

<p/>The gate-keeper let him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in through the same stiff crevice as before,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed through the court and over the little rustic bridge on the
moat. The door was opened before he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had reached it, and, as if to put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) clemency to rout with the suggestion of a richer opportunity, Mrs.
Bread stood there awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face, as usual, looked as hopelessly
blank as the tide-smoothed sea-sand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) black garments seemed of
an intenser sable. Newman had already learned that her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strange
inexpressiveness could be a vehicle for emotion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not
surprised at the muffled vivacity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``I thought
you would try again, sir. I was looking out for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``I think you are my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) opaquely. <div class="bookquote">``I wish you well sir; but it's vain
wishing now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, then, how they have treated me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, dryly, <div class="bookquote">``I know everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Everything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bread</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a glance somewhat more lucent. <div class="bookquote">``I know at least too
much, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One can never know too much. I congratulate you. I have come to see
Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added. <div class="bookquote">``Are they at home? If
they are not, I will wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lady is always at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread replied, <div class="bookquote">``and the marquis is
mostly with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please then tell them--one or the other, or both--that I am here and
that I desire to see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``May I take a great liberty, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never taken a liberty but you have justified it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman,
with diplomatic urbanity.

<p/>Mrs. Bread dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) wrinkled eyelids as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) were curtseying; but
the curtsey stopped there; the occasion was too grave. <div class="bookquote">``You have come to
plead with them again, sir? Perhaps you don't know this--that Madame de
Cintré returned this morning to Paris.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And Newman, groaning, smote the pavement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has gone straight to the convent--the Carmelites they call it. I
see you know, sir. My lady and the marquis take it very ill. It was only
last night she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had kept it back, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Good, good! And they
are very fierce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not pleased,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``But they may well dislike it.
They tell me it's most dreadful, sir; of all the nuns in Christendom the
Carmelites are the worst. You may say they are really not human, sir;
they make you give up everything--forever. And to think of _her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)_ there!
If I was one that cried, sir, I could cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) an instant. <div class="bookquote">``We mustn't cry, Mrs. Bread; we must
act. Go and call them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made a movement to enter farther.

<p/>But Mrs. Bread gently checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``May I take another liberty? I am
told you were with my dearest Mr. Valentin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) last hours. If you
would tell me a word about him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)! The poor count was my own boy, sir; for
the first year of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was hardly out of my arms; I taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
to speak. And the count spoke so well, sir! He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always spoke well to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
poor old Bread. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grew up and took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always had a
kind word for me. And to die in that wild way! They have a story that
he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fought with a wine-merchant. I can't believe that, sir! And was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in
great pain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a wise, kind old woman, Mrs. Bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I hoped I
might see you with my own children in your arms. Perhaps I shall, yet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand. Mrs. Bread looked for a moment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) open
palm, and then, as if fascinated by the novelty of the gesture, extended
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) own ladylike fingers. Newman held her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) hand firmly and deliberately,
fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You want to know all about Mr. Valentin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a sad pleasure, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you everything. Can you sometimes leave this place?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The château, sir? I really don't know. I never tried.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Try, then; try hard. Try this evening, at dusk. Come to me in the old
ruin there on the hill, in the court before the church. I will wait for
you there; I have something very important to tell you. An old woman
like you can do as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread stared, wondering, with parted lips. <div class="bookquote">``Is it from the count,
sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the count--from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) death-bed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will come, then. I will be bold, for once, for _him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) led Newman into the great drawing-room with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had already
made acquaintance, and retired to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) commands. Newman waited
a long time; at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was on the point of ringing and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
request. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for a bell when the marquis came in
with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mother on his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) arm. It will be seen that Newman had a logical
mind when I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) declared to himself, in perfect good faith, as
a result of Valentin's dark hints, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) adversaries looked grossly
wicked. <div class="bookquote">``There is no mistake about it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said to himself as they
advanced. <div class="bookquote">``They're a bad lot; they have pulled off the mask.''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>Madame
de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son certainly bore in their faces the signs of
extreme perturbation; they looked like people who had passed a sleepless
night. Confronted, moreover, with an annoyance which they hoped they had
disposed of, it was not natural that they should have any very tender
glances to bestow upon Newman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood before them, and such eye-beams
as they found available they leveled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); Newman feeling as if the
door of a sepulchre had suddenly been opened, and the damp darkness were
being exhaled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see I have come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have come to try again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde, <div class="bookquote">``to pretend that we are
glad to see you or that we don't question the taste of your visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't talk about taste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``or that will
bring us round to yours! If I consulted my taste I certainly shouldn't
come to see you. Besides, I will make as short work as you please.
Promise me to raise the blockade--to set Madame de Cintré at
liberty--and I will retire instantly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We hesitated as to whether we would see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de
Bellegarde; <div class="bookquote">``and we were on the point of declining the honor. But it
seemed to me that we should act with civility, as we have always done,
and I wished to have the satisfaction of informing you that there are
certain weaknesses that people of our way of feeling can be guilty of
but once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be weak but once, but you will be audacious many times, madam,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't come however, for conversational purposes.
I came to say this, simply: that if you will write immediately to your
daughter that you withdraw your opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage, I will take
care of the rest. You don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to turn nun--you know more about
the horrors of it than I do. Marrying a commercial person is better than
that. Give me a letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), signed and sealed, saying you retract and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) may marry me with your blessing, and I will take it to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) at
the convent and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) out. There's your chance--I call those easy
terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We look at the matter otherwise, you know. We call them very hard
terms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Urbain/Urbain de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Urbain de Bellegarde. They had all remained standing
rigidly in the middle of the room. <div class="bookquote">``I think my mother will tell you that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would rather her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter should become Sœur Catherine than Mrs.
Newman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>But the old lady, with the serenity of supreme power, let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son make
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) epigrams for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only smiled, almost sweetly, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head
and repeating, <div class="bookquote">``But once, Mr. Newman; but once!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing that Newman had ever seen or heard gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) such a sense of
marble hardness as this movement and the tone that accompanied it.
<div class="bookquote">``Could anything compel you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know of anything that
would force you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This language, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, <div class="bookquote">``addressed to people in
bereavement and grief is beyond all qualification.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In most cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, <div class="bookquote">``your objection would have some
weight, even admitting that Madame de Cintré's present intentions make
time precious. But I have thought of what you speak of, and I have come
here to-day without scruple simply because I consider your brother and
you two very different parties. I see no connection between you. Your
brother was ashamed of you. Lying there wounded and dying, the poor
fellow apologized to me for your conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) apologized to me for that
of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment the effect of these words was as if Newman had struck
a physical blow. A quick flush leaped into the faces of Madame de
Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son, and they exchanged a glance like a twinkle of
steel. Urbain uttered two words which Newman but half heard, but of
which the sense came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as it were in the reverberation of the
sound, <div class="bookquote">``_Le misérable!_''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You show little respect for the living,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde,
<div class="bookquote">``but at least respect the dead. Don't profane--don't insult--the memory
of my innocent son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I speak the simple truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman declared, <div class="bookquote">``and I speak it for a
purpose. I repeat it--distinctly. Your son was utterly disgusted--your
son apologized.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Urbain de Bellegarde was frowning portentously, and Newman supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was frowning at poor Valentin's invidious image. Taken by surprise,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) scant affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) brother had made a momentary concession to
dishonor. But not for an appreciable instant did his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mother lower her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
flag. <div class="bookquote">``You are immensely mistaken, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``My son was sometimes
light, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was never indecent. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) died faithful to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You simply misunderstood him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, beginning to rally.
<div class="bookquote">``You affirm the impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't care for poor Valentin's apology,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It was
far more painful than pleasant to me. This atrocious thing was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
fault; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) never hurt me, or anyone else; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was the soul of honor. But
it shows how he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) took it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you wish to prove that my poor brother, in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) last moments, was
out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head, we can only say that under the melancholy circumstances
nothing was more possible. But confine yourself to that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was quite in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) right mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with gentle but dangerous
doggedness; <div class="bookquote">``I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) so bright and clever. It was terrible
to see that witty, capable fellow dying such a death. You know I was
very fond of your brother. And I have further proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sanity,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman concluded.

<p/>The marquise gathered herself together majestically. <div class="bookquote">``This is too
gross!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``We decline to accept your story, sir--we repudiate
it. Urbain, open the door.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away, with an imperious motion
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, and passed rapidly down the length of the room. The marquis
went with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and held the door open. Newman was left standing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) finger, as a sign to M. de Bellegarde, who closed the
door behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother and stood waiting. Newman slowly advanced, more
silent, for the moment, than life. The two men stood face to face. Then
Newman had a singular sensation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sense of injury almost
brimming over into jocularity. <div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you don't treat me
well; at least admit that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) from head to foot, and then, in the most
delicate, best-bred voice, <div class="bookquote">``I detest you personally,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's the way I feel to you, but for politeness sake I don't say
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It's singular I should want so much to be your
brother-in-law, but I can't give it up. Let me try once more.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
paused a moment. <div class="bookquote">``You have a secret--you have a skeleton in the closet.''
 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de Bellegarde continued to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hard, but Newman could not see
whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes betrayed anything; the look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes was always so
strange. Newman paused again, and then went on. <div class="bookquote">``You and your mother
have committed a crime.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>At this M. de Bellegarde's eyes certainly did
change; they seemed to flicker, like blown candles. Newman could see
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was profoundly startled; but there was something admirable in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) self-control.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Continue,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said M. de Bellegarde.

<p/>Newman lifted a finger and made it waver a little in the air. <div class="bookquote">``Need I
continue? You are trembling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray where did you obtain this interesting information?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de
Bellegarde asked, very softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be strictly accurate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I won't pretend to know
more than I do. At present that is all I know. You have done something
that you must hide, something that would damn you if it were known,
something that would disgrace the name you are so proud of. I don't know
what it is, but I can find out. Persist in your present course and I
_will_ find out. Change it, let your sister go in peace, and I will
leave you alone. It's a bargain?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis almost succeeded in looking untroubled; the breaking up
of the ice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) handsome countenance was an operation that was
necessarily gradual. But Newman's mildly-syllabled argumentation seemed
to press, and press, and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) averted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood some
moments, reflecting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother told you this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, looking up.

<p/>Newman hesitated a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, your brother told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis smiled, handsomely. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mind if I don't find out. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was very much in it if I
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde gave a shrug. <div class="bookquote">``Eh, sir, find out or not, as you
please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't frighten you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>demanded Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's for you to judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it's for you to judge, at your leisure. Think it over, feel
yourself all round. I will give you an hour or two. I can't give you
more, for how do we know how fast they may be making Madame de Cintré
a nun? Talk it over with your mother; let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) judge whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is
frightened. I don't believe she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is as easily frightened, in general, as
you; but you will see. I will go and wait in the village, at the inn,
and I beg you to let me know as soon as possible. Say by three o’clock.
A simple _yes_ or _no_ on paper will do. Only, you know, in case of a
_yes_ I shall expect you, this time, to stick to your bargain.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And with
this Newman opened the door and let himself out. The marquis did not
move, and Newman, retiring, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) another look. <div class="bookquote">``At the inn, in the
village,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) repeated. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away altogether and passed out of
the house.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was extremely excited by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been doing, for it was
inevitable that there should be a certain emotion in calling up the
spectre of dishonor before a family a thousand years old. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went
back to the inn and contrived to wait there, deliberately, for the next
two hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought it more than probable that Urbain de Bellegarde
would give no sign; for an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) challenge, in either sense,
would be a confession of guilt. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) most expected was silence--in
other words defiance. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) prayed that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) imagined it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) shot
might bring them down. It did bring, by three o’clock, a note, delivered
by a footman; a note addressed in Urbain de Bellegarde's handsome
English hand. It ran as follows:--

<p/>``I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of letting you know that I return
to Paris, to-morrow, with my mother, in order that we may see my sister
and confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the resolution which is the most effectual reply to
your audacious pertinacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HENRI-URBAIN DE BELLEGARDE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman put the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket, and continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walk up and
down the inn-parlor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had spent most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) time, for the past week,
in walking up and down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued to measure the length of the little
_salle_ of the Armes de France until the day began to wane, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went
out to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rendezvous with Mrs. Bread. The path which led up
the hill to the ruin was easy to find, and Newman in a short time had
followed it to the top. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) passed beneath the rugged arch of the castle
wall, and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in the early dusk for an old woman in black.
The castle yard was empty, but the door of the church was open. Newman
went into the little nave and of course found a deeper dusk than
without. A couple of tapers, however, twinkled on the altar and just
enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to perceive a figure seated by one of the pillars. Closer
inspection helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to recognize Mrs. Bread, in spite of the fact
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dressed with unwonted splendor. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a large black
silk bonnet, with imposing bows of crape, and an old black satin dress
disposed itself in vaguely lustrous folds about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) person. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
judged it proper to the occasion to appear in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stateliest apparel.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the ground, but when
Newman passed before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you a Catholic, Mrs. Bread?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I'm a good Church-of-England woman, very Low,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered.
<div class="bookquote">``But I thought I should be safer in here than outside. I was never out
in the evening before, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall be safer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``where no one can hear us.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) led
the way back into the castle court and then followed a path beside the
church, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was sure must lead into another part of the ruin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
was not deceived. It wandered along the crest of the hill and terminated
before a fragment of wall pierced by a rough aperture which had once
been a door. Through this aperture Newman passed and found himself in
a nook peculiarly favorable to quiet conversation, as probably many
an earnest couple, otherwise assorted than our friends, had assured
themselves. The hill sloped abruptly away, and on the remnant of its
crest were scattered two or three fragments of stone. Beneath, over the
plain, lay the gathered twilight, through which, in the near distance,
gleamed two or three lights from the château. Mrs. Bread rustled slowly
after her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) guide, and Newman, satisfying himself that one of the fallen
stones was steady, proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) to sit upon it. She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) cautiously
complied, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) placed himself upon another, near her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXII

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you for coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said. <div class="bookquote">``I hope it
won't get you into trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall be missed. My lady, in these days, is not fond of
having me about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>This was said with a certain fluttered eagerness
which increased Newman's sense of having inspired the old woman with
confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From the first, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``you took an interest in my
prospects. You were on my side. That gratified me, I assure you. And now
that you know what they have done to me, I am sure you are with me all
the more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They have not done well--I must say it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``But you
mustn't blame the poor countess; they pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would give a million of dollars to know what they did to her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried
Newman.

<p/>Mrs. Bread sat with a dull, oblique gaze fixed upon the lights of the
château. <div class="bookquote">``They worked on her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) feelings; they knew that was the way.
She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is a delicate creature. They made her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) feel wicked. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) is only too
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, they made her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) feel wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, slowly; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
repeated it. <div class="bookquote">``They made her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) feel wicked,--they made her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) feel wicked.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The words seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) for the moment a vivid description of infernal
ingenuity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was because she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was so good that she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) gave up--poor sweet lady!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was better to them than to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, very confidently; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) has always
been afraid, or at least for a long time. That was the real trouble,
sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was like a fair peach, I may say, with just one little speck.
She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) had one little sad spot. You pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) into the sunshine, sir, and
it almost disappeared. Then they pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) back into the shade and in
a moment it began to spread. Before we knew it she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was a
delicate creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Cintré</b></font>)</div><p/>This singular attestation of Madame de Cintré's delicacy, for all its
singularity, set Newman's wound aching afresh. <div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently
said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) knew something bad about her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) knew nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head very
stiff and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the glimmering windows of the
château.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) guessed something, then, or suspected it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) was afraid to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But _you_ know, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slowly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vague eyes upon Newman, squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands
together in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap. <div class="bookquote">``You are not quite faithful, sir. I thought it was
to tell me about Mr. Valentin you asked me to come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the more we talk of Mr. Valentin the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``That's
exactly what I want. I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), as I told you, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) last hour.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was in a great deal of pain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was quite himself. You know what
that means; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was bright and lively and clever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would always be clever, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) know
of your trouble?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) guessed it of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) say to it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said it was a disgrace to his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) name--but it was not the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord, Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mother and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brother had once put their heads
together and invented something even worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have listened to that, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not. But I _did_ listen, and I don't forget it. Now I want to
know what it is they did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread gave a soft moan. <div class="bookquote">``And you have enticed me up into this
strange place to tell you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I won't say a word that shall be
disagreeable to you. Tell me as it suits you, and when it suits you.
Only remember that it was Mr. Valentin's last wish that you should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) say that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) said it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) last breath--`Tell Mrs. Bread I told you to ask
her (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>).'''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) tell you himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was too long a story for a dying man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no breath left in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
body. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted me to know--that, wronged as I
was, it was my right to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how will it help you, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's for me to decide. Mr. Valentin believed it would, and that's why
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) told me. Your name was almost the last word he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) spoke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread was evidently awe-struck by this statement; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
clasped hands slowly up and down. <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if I take
a great liberty. Is it the solemn truth you are speaking? I _must_ ask
you that; must I not, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no offense. It _is_ the solemn truth; I solemnly swear it. Mr.
Valentin himself would certainly have told me more if he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) had been able.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) knew more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) did?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no saying what he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) knew about anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, with
a mild head-shake. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was so mightily clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) could make you believe
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) knew things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) didn't, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) didn't know others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
had better not have known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) knew something about his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) brother that kept the marquis
civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman propounded; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) made the marquis feel him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>). What he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>)
wanted now was to put me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) place; he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) wanted to give me a chance to
make the marquis feel _me_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us!''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiting-woman</b></font>)</div>cried the old waiting-woman, <div class="bookquote">``how wicked we all are!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the waiting-woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``some of us are wicked, certainly. I am
very angry, I am very sore, and I am very bitter, but I don't know that
I am wicked. I have been cruelly injured. They have hurt me, and I want
to hurt them. I don't deny that; on the contrary, I tell you plainly
that it is the use I want to make of your secret.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread seemed to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``You want to publish them--you
want to shame them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to bring them down,--down, down, down! I want to turn the tables
upon them--I want to mortify them as they mortified me. They took me up
into a high place and made me stand there for all the world to see me,
and then they stole behind me and pushed me into this bottomless pit,
where I lie howling and gnashing my teeth! I made a fool of myself
before all their friends; but I shall make something worse of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>This passionate sally, which Newman uttered with the greater fervor that
it was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had had a chance to say all this aloud, kindled
two small sparks in Mrs. Bread's fixed eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have a right
to your anger, sir; but think of the dishonor you will draw down on
Madame de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré is buried alive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``What are honor or
dishonor to her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>)? The door of the tomb is at this moment closing behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's most awful,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>moaned Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) has moved off, like her (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) brother Valentin, to give me room to work.
It's as if it were done on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, apparently impressed by the ingenuity of this
reflection. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was silent for some moments; then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``And would
you bring my lady before the courts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The courts care nothing for my lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman replied. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has
committed a crime, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will be nothing for the courts but a wicked old
woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And will they hang her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends upon what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has done.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And Newman eyed Mrs. Bread
intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would break up the family most terribly, sir!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's time such a family should be broken up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, with a
laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And me at my age out of place, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I will take care of you! You shall come and live with me. You shall
be my housekeeper, or anything you like. I will pension you for life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear, sir, you think of everything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to fall
a-brooding.

<p/>Newman watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a while, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mrs. Bread,
you are too fond of my lady!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have you say that, sir. I
don't think it any part of my duty to be fond of my lady. I have served
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) faithfully this many a year; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were to die to-morrow, I
believe, before Heaven I shouldn't shed a tear for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, after a
pause, <div class="bookquote">``I have no reason to love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread added. <div class="bookquote">``The most she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
has done for me has been not to turn me out of the house.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman felt
that decidedly his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion was more and more confidential--that if
luxury is corrupting, Mrs. Bread's conservative habits were already
relaxed by the spiritual comfort of this preconcerted interview, in
a remarkable locality, with a free-spoken millionaire. All his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) native
shrewdness admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) part was simply to let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
time--let the charm of the occasion work. So he (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>millionaire</b></font>) only
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kindly. Mrs. Bread sat nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lean elbows. <div class="bookquote">``My lady
once did me a great wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on at last. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has a terrible
tongue when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is vexed. It was many a year ago, but I have never
forgotten it. I have never mentioned it to a human creature; I have kept
my grudge to myself. I dare say I have been wicked, but my grudge has
grown old with me. It has grown good for nothing, too, I dare say;
but it has lived along, as I have lived. It will die when I die,--not
before!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what _is_ your grudge?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/>Mrs. Bread dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes and hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``If I were a foreigner,
sir, I should make less of telling you; it comes harder to a decent
Englishwoman. But I sometimes think I have picked up too many foreign
ways. What I was telling you belongs to a time when I was much younger
and very different looking to what I am now. I had a very high color,
sir, if you can believe it, indeed I was a very smart lass. My lady was
younger, too, and the late marquis was youngest of all--I mean in the
way he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) went on, sir; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had a very high spirit; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was a magnificent
man. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) pleasure, like most foreigners, and it must be
owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) sometimes went rather below him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) to take it. My lady was
often jealous, and, if you'll believe it, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did me the honor to
be jealous of me. One day I had a red ribbon in my cap, and my lady flew
out at me and ordered me to take it off. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) accused me of putting it on
to make the marquis look at me. I don't know that I was impertinent, but
I spoke up like an honest girl and didn't count my words. A red ribbon
indeed! As if it was my ribbons the marquis looked at! My lady knew
afterwards that I was perfectly respectable, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) never said a word
to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed it. But the marquis did!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread presently
added, <div class="bookquote">``I took off my red ribbon and put it away in a drawer, where I
have kept it to this day. It's faded now, it's a very pale pink; but
there it lies. My grudge has faded, too; the red has all gone out of it;
but it lies here yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Bread stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) black satin bodice.

<p/>Newman listened with interest to this decent narrative, which seemed
to have opened up the deeps of memory to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion. Then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
remained silent, and seemed to be losing herself in retrospective
meditation upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perfect respectability, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ventured upon a short
cut to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) goal. <div class="bookquote">``So Madame de Bellegarde was jealous; I see. And M. de
Bellegarde admired pretty women, without distinction of class. I suppose
one mustn't be hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), for they probably didn't all behave so
properly as you. But years afterwards it could hardly have been jealousy
that turned Madame de Bellegarde into a criminal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread gave a weary sigh. <div class="bookquote">``We are using dreadful words, sir, but I
don't care now. I see you have your idea, and I have no will of my own.
My will was the will of my children, as I called them; but I have lost
my children now. They are dead--I may say it of both of them; and
what should I care for the living? What is anyone in the house to me
now--what am I to them? My lady objects to me--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has objected to me
these thirty years. I should have been glad to be something to young
Madame de Bellegarde, though I never was nurse to the present marquis.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was a baby I was too young; they wouldn't trust me with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). But
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) wife told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own maid, Mamselle Clarisse, the opinion she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had of
me. Perhaps you would like to hear it, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, immensely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said that if I would sit in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children's schoolroom I should do
very well for a penwiper! When things have come to that I don't think I
need stand upon ceremony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Go on, Mrs. Bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread, however, relapsed again into troubled dumbness, and all
Newman could do was to fold his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms and wait. But at last she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared
to have set her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) memories in order. <div class="bookquote">``It was when the late marquis was an
old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) eldest son had been two years married. It was when the
time came on for marrying Mademoiselle Claire; that's the way they talk
of it here, you know, sir. The marquis's health was bad; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was very
much broken down. My lady had picked out M. de Cintré, for no good
reason that I could see. But there are reasons, I very well know, that
are beyond me, and you must be high in the world to understand them. Old
M. de Cintré was very high, and my lady thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>) almost as good
as herself; that's saying a good deal. Mr. Urbain took sides with his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)
mother, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) always did. The trouble, I believe, was that my lady would
give very little money, and all the other gentlemen asked more. It was
only M. de Cintré that was satisfied. The Lord willed it he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) should have
that one soft spot; it was the only one he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may have been very
grand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) birth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) certainly was very grand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bows and
speeches; but that was all the grandeur he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was like what
I have heard of comedians; not that I have ever seen one. But I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
painted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might paint it all he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) would; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) could never make me
like it! The marquis couldn't abide him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>), and declared that sooner than
take such a husband as that Mademoiselle Claire should take none at
all. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and my lady had a great scene; it came even to our ears in the
servants' hall. It was not their first quarrel, if the truth must be
told. They were not a loving couple, but they didn't often come to
words, because, I think, neither of them thought the other's doings
worth the trouble. My lady had long ago got over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) jealousy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had taken to indifference. In this, I must say, they were well matched.
The marquis was very easy-going; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had a most gentlemanly temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
got angry only once a year, but then it was very bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) always took to
bed directly afterwards. This time I speak of he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) took to bed as usual,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) never got up again. I'm afraid the poor gentleman was paying for
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dissipation; isn't it true they mostly do, sir, when they get old?
My lady and Mr. Urbain kept quiet, but I know my lady wrote letters
to M. de Cintré. The marquis got worse and the doctors gave him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) up. My
lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) up too, and if the truth must be told, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
up gladly. When once he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was out of the way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pleased
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter, and it was all arranged that my poor innocent child
should be handed over to M. de Cintré. You don't know what Mademoiselle
was in those days, sir; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was the sweetest young creature in France,
and knew as little of what was going on around her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as the lamb does of
the butcher. I used to nurse the marquis, and I was always in his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) room.
It was here at Fleurières, in the autumn. We had a doctor from Paris,
who came and stayed two or three weeks in the house. Then there came two
others, and there was a consultation, and these two others, as I said,
declared that the marquis couldn't be saved. After this they went off,
pocketing their fees, but the other one stayed and did what he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) could.
The marquis himself kept crying out that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) wouldn't die, that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
didn't want to die, that he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) would live and look after his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) daughter.
Mademoiselle Claire and the viscount--that was Mr. Valentin, you
know--were both in the house. The doctor was a clever man,--that I could
see myself,--and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) believed that the marquis might get well. We
took good care of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) and I, between us, and one day, when my lady
had almost ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mourning, my patient suddenly began to mend. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)
got better and better, till the doctor said he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was out of danger. What
was killing him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) was the dreadful fits of pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) stomach. But little
by little they stopped, and the poor marquis began to make his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) jokes
again. The doctor found something that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) great comfort--some
white stuff that we kept in a great bottle on the chimney-piece. I
used to give it to the marquis through a glass tube; it always made him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
easier. Then the doctor went away, after telling me to keep on giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) the mixture whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was bad. After that there was a little
doctor from Poitiers, who came every day. So we were alone in the
house--my lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) poor husband and their three children. Young
Madame de Bellegarde had gone away, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little girl, to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
mothers. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is very lively, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) maid told me that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
didn't like to be where people were dying.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread paused a moment,
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on with the same quiet consistency. <div class="bookquote">``I think you
have guessed, sir, that when the marquis began to turn my lady was
disappointed.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) paused again, bending upon Newman a face which
seemed to grow whiter as the darkness settled down upon them.

<p/>Newman had listened eagerly--with an eagerness greater even than that
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ear to Valentin de Bellegarde's last words.
Every now and then, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) companion looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
of an ancient tabby cat, protracting the enjoyment of a dish of milk.
Even her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) triumph was measured and decorous; the faculty of exultation
had been chilled by disuse. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presently continued. <div class="bookquote">``Late one night I
was sitting by the marquis in his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) room, the great red room in the west
tower. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had been complaining a little, and I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) a spoonful
of the doctor's dose. My lady had been there in the early part of the
evening; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat far more than an hour by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) bed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went away
and left me alone. After midnight she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came back, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eldest son was
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). They went to the bed and looked at the marquis, and my lady
took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hand. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned to me and said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not so
well; I remember how the marquis, without saying anything, lay staring
at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). I can see his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) white face, at this moment, in the great black
square between the bed-curtains. I said I didn't think he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was very bad;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me to go to bed--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would sit a while with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). When the
marquis saw me going he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) gave a sort of groan, and called out to me not
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>); but Mr. Urbain opened the door for me and pointed the
way out. The present marquis--perhaps you have noticed, sir--has a very
proud way of giving orders, and I was there to take orders. I went to
my room, but I wasn't easy; I couldn't tell you why. I didn't undress;
I sat there waiting and listening. For what, would you have said, sir? I
couldn't have told you; for surely a poor gentleman might be comfortable
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son. It was as if I expected to hear the marquis
moaning after me again. I listened, but I heard nothing. It was a very
still night; I never knew a night so still. At last the very stillness
itself seemed to frighten me, and I came out of my room and went very
softly downstairs. In the anteroom, outside of the marquis's chamber, I
found Mr. Urbain walking up and down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) asked me what I wanted, and I
said I came back to relieve my lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) said _he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)_ would relieve my lady,
and ordered me back to bed; but as I stood there, unwilling to turn
away, the door of the room opened and my lady came out. I noticed she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was very pale; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked a moment at the count
and at me, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms to the count. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face. I went quickly past her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into the
room and to the marquis's bed. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was lying there, very white, with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
eyes shut, like a corpse. I took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hand and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) felt to me like a dead man. Then I turned round; my lady and
Mr. Urbain were there. `My poor Bread,' said my lady, `M. le Marquis is
gone.' Mr. Urbain knelt down by the bed and said softly, `_Mon père, mon
père_.' I thought it wonderful strange, and asked my lady what in the
world had happened, and why she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hadn't called me. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said nothing had
happened; that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had only been sitting there with the marquis, very
quiet. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might sleep, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had
slept, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't know how long. When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) woke up he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was dead. `It's
death, my son, it's death,' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said to the count. Mr. Urbain said they
must have the doctor, immediately, from Poitiers, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) would ride
off and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) father's face, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)
mother and went away. My lady and I stood there at the bedside. As I
looked at the poor marquis it came into my head that he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was not dead,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was in a kind of swoon. And then my lady repeated, `My poor
Bread, it's death, it's death;' and I said, `Yes, my lady, it's
certainly death.' I said just the opposite to what I believed; it was my
notion. Then my lady said we must wait for the doctor, and we sat there
and waited. It was a long time; the poor marquis neither stirred nor
changed. `I have seen death before,' said my lady, `and it's terribly
like this.' `Yes, please, my lady,' said I; and I kept thinking. The
night wore away without the count's coming back, and my lady began to
be frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had had an accident in the dark, or met
with some wild people. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got so restless that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went below
to watch in the court for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son's return. I sat there alone and the
marquis never stirred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs. Bread paused again, and the most artistic of romancers could
not have been more effective. Newman made a movement as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) were
turning over the page of a novel. <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) _was_ dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) exclaimed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three days afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread,
sententiously. <div class="bookquote">``In a little while I went away to the front of the house
and looked out into the court, and there, before long, I saw Mr. Urbain
ride in alone. I waited a bit, to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) come upstairs with his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)
mother, but they stayed below, and I went back to the marquis's room.
I went to the bed and held up the light to him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>), but I don't know why
I didn't let the candlestick fall. The marquis's eyes were open--open
wide! they were staring at me. I knelt down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) and took his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
hands, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) to tell me, in the name of wonder, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) was
alive or dead. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) looked at me a long time, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) made me a
sign to put my ear close to him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>): `I am dead,' he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) said, `I am dead. The
marquise has killed me.' I was all in a tremble; I didn't understand
him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) seemed both a man and a corpse, if you can fancy, sir. `But
you'll get well now, sir,' I said. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) whispered again, ever
so weak; `I wouldn't get well for a kingdom. I wouldn't be that woman's
husband again.' And then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said more; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only replied, `Murder,
murder. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll kill my daughter,' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said; `my poor unhappy child.'
And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) begged me to prevent that, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dying,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dead. I was afraid to move or to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); I was almost
dead myself. All of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) asked me to get a pencil and write for
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and then I had to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that I couldn't manage a pencil. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
asked me to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up in bed while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrote himself, and I said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could never, never do such a thing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to have a kind of
terror that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) strength. I found a pencil in the room and a piece
of paper and a book, and I put the paper on the book and the pencil into
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, and moved the candle near him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). You will think all this very
strange, sir; and very strange it was. The strangest part of it was that
I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was dying, and that I was eager to help him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to write. I
sat on the bed and put my arm round him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and held him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up. I felt very
strong; I believe I could have lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It was a
wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wrote, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did write, in a big scratching hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
almost covered one side of the paper. It seemed a long time; I suppose
it was three or four minutes. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was groaning, terribly, all the while.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said it was ended, and I let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) pillows and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
gave me the paper and told me to fold it, and hide it, and give it to
those who would act upon it. `Whom do you mean?' I said. `Who are those
who will act upon it?' But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only groaned, for an answer; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) couldn't
speak, for weakness. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told me to go and look at the
bottle on the chimney-piece. I knew the bottle he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) meant; the white
stuff that was good for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stomach. I went and looked at it, but it was
empty. When I came back his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes were open and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was staring at me; but
soon he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) closed them and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said no more. I hid the paper in my dress;
I didn't look at what was written upon it, though I can read very well,
sir, if I haven't any handwriting. I sat down near the bed, but it was
nearly half an hour before my lady and the count came in. The marquis
looked as he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) did when they left him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>), and I never said a word about his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>)
having been otherwise. Mr. Urbain said that the doctor had been
called to a person in childbirth, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) promised to set out for
Fleurières immediately. In another half hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) arrived, and as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) had examined the marquis he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) said that we had had a false alarm. The
poor gentleman was very low, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was still living. I watched my lady
and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said this, to see if they looked at each other, and
I am obliged to admit that they didn't. The doctor said there was no
reason he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should die; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been going on so well. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wanted
to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had suddenly fallen off; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had left him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) so very hearty.
My lady told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little story again--what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had told Mr. Urbain and
me--and the doctor looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stayed all the
next day at the château, and hardly left the marquis. I was always
there. Mademoiselle and Mr. Valentin came and looked at their father,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) never stirred. It was a strange, deathly stupor. My lady was
always about; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face was as white as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked
very proud, as I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) orders or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wishes had
been disobeyed. It was as if the poor marquis had defied her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and the
way she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took it made me afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The apothecary from Poitiers kept
the marquis along through the day, and we waited for the other doctor
from Paris, who, as I told you, had been staying at Fleurières. They had
telegraphed for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) early in the morning, and in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) arrived.
He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talked a bit outside with the doctor from Poitiers, and then they
came in to see the marquis together. I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>), and so was Mr.
Urbain. My lady had been to receive the doctor from Paris, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
didn't come back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) sat down by the marquis;
I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) there now, with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hand on the marquis's wrist, and Mr.
Urbain watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) with a little looking-glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) hand. `I'm sure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>)'s better,' said the little doctor from Poitiers; `I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'ll come
back.' A few moments after he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had said this the marquis opened his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were waking up, and looked at us, from one to the other. I saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) look at me very softly, as you'd say. At the same moment my lady
came in on tiptoe; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came up to the bed and put in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head between me
and the count. The marquis saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and gave a long, most wonderful moan.
He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) said something we couldn't understand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) seemed to have a kind
of spasm. He (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) shook all over and then closed his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) eyes, and the doctor
jumped up and took hold of my lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for a moment a bit
roughly. The marquis was stone dead! This time there were those there
that knew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been reading by starlight the report of highly
important evidence in a great murder case. <div class="bookquote">``And the paper--the paper!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, excitedly. <div class="bookquote">``What was written upon it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't read it; it
was in French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But could no one else read it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never asked a human creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No one has ever seen it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you see it you'll be the first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman seized the old woman's hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own and pressed it
vigorously. <div class="bookquote">``I thank you ever so much for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``I want to
be the first, I want it to be my property and no one else's! You're the
wisest old woman in Europe. And what did you do with the paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This
information had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feel extraordinarily strong. <div class="bookquote">``Give it to me
quick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread got up with a certain majesty. <div class="bookquote">``It is not so easy as that,
sir. If you want the paper, you must wait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But waiting is horrible, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>urged Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure _I_ have waited; I have waited these many years,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very true. You have waited for me. I won't forget it. And yet,
how comes it you didn't do as M. de Bellegarde said, show the paper to
someone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To whom should I show it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Bread, mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``It was not
easy to know, and many's the night I have lain awake thinking of it.
Six months afterwards, when they married Mademoiselle to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) vicious old
husband, I was very near bringing it out. I thought it was my duty to do
something with it, and yet I was mightily afraid. I didn't know what
was written on the paper or how bad it might be, and there was no one
I could trust enough to ask. And it seemed to me a cruel kindness to do
that sweet young creature, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) know that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father had written
her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother down so shamefully; for that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, I suppose. I
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would rather be unhappy with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) husband than be unhappy
that way. It was for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and for my dear Mr. Valentin I kept quiet.
Quiet I call it, but for me it was a weary quietness. It worried me
terribly, and it changed me altogether. But for others I held my tongue,
and no one, to this hour, knows what passed between the poor marquis and
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But evidently there were suspicions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Where did Mr.
Valentin get his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) ideas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was the little doctor from Poitiers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was very ill-satisfied, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) made a great talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was a sharp Frenchman, and coming to the house,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) did day after day, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) saw more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) seemed to see.
And indeed the way the poor marquis went off as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) eyes fell on
my lady was a most shocking sight for anyone. The medical gentleman from
Paris was much more accommodating, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hushed up the other. But for
all he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could do Mr. Valentin and Mademoiselle heard something; they knew
their father's death was somehow against nature. Of course they couldn't
accuse their mother, and, as I tell you, I was as dumb as that stone.
Mr. Valentin used to look at me sometimes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) eyes seemed to shine,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) were thinking of asking me something. I was dreadfully afraid
he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would speak, and I always looked away and went about my business. If
I were to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), I was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) would hate me afterwards, and that I
could never have borne. Once I went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) and took a great liberty;
I kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>), as I had kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Valentin</b></font>) was a child. `You oughtn't to
look so sad, sir,' I said; `believe your poor old Bread. Such a gallant,
handsome young man can have nothing to be sad about.' And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
understood me; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood that I was begging off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own way. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unasked question in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, as I did with my untold tale; we were both afraid of bringing
dishonor on a great house. And it was the same with Mademoiselle. She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>)
didn't know what happened; she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) wouldn't know. My lady and Mr. Urbain
asked me no questions because they had no reason. I was as still as
a mouse. When I was younger my lady thought me a hussy, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
thought me a fool. How should I have any ideas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you say the little doctor from Poitiers made a talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``Did no one take it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard nothing of it, sir. They are always talking scandal in these
foreign countries you may have noticed--and I suppose they shook their
heads over Madame de Bellegarde. But after all, what could they say? The
marquis had been ill, and the marquis had died; he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) had as good a right
to die as anyone. The doctor couldn't say he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had not come honestly by
his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cramps. The next year the little doctor left the place and bought a
practice in Bordeaux, and if there has been any gossip it died out.
And I don't think there could have been much gossip about my lady that
anyone would listen to. My lady is so very respectable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, at this last affirmation, broke into an immense, resounding
laugh. Mrs. Bread had begun to move away from the spot where they were
sitting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) helped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through the aperture in the wall and
along the homeward path. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my lady's respectability is
delicious; it will be a great crash!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They reached the empty space in
front of the church, where they stopped a moment, looking at each
other with something of an air of closer fellowship--like two sociable
conspirators. <div class="bookquote">``But what was it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``what was it she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did to
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband? She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) didn't stab him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or poison him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, sir; no one saw it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless it was Mr. Urbain. You say he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was walking up and down, outside
the room. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) looked through the keyhole. But no; I think that
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) would take it on trust.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure I have often thought of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands. I saw nothing on him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>),
anywhere. I believe it was in this way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) had a fit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) great pain,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) medicine. Instead of giving it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went
and poured it away, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) eyes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meant, and,
weak and helpless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) was terrified. `You
want to kill me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>) said. `Yes, M. le Marquis, I want to kill you,'
says my lady, and sits down and fixes her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>). You know my
lady's eyes, I think, sir; it was with them she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Urbain</b></font>); it was
with the terrible strong will she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put into them. It was like a frost on
flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are a very intelligent woman; you have shown great
discretion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I shall value your services as housekeeper
extremely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bread</b></font>)</div><p/>They had begun to descend the hill, and Mrs. Bread said nothing until
they reached the foot. Newman strolled lightly beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head was
thrown back and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was gazing at all the stars; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to himself to
be riding his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) vengeance along the Milky Way. <div class="bookquote">``So you are serious, sir,
about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, softly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``About your living with me? Why of course I will take care of you to the
end of your days. You can't live with those people any longer. And you
oughtn't to, you know, after this. You give me the paper, and you move
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems very flighty in me to be taking a new place at this time of
life,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Bread, lugubriously. <div class="bookquote">``But if you are going to turn
the house upside down, I would rather be out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, in the cheerful tone of a man who feels rich in
alternatives. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall bring in the constables, if that's
what you mean. Whatever Madame de Bellegarde did, I am afraid the law
can't take hold of it. But I am glad of that; it leaves it altogether to
me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a mighty bold gentleman, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Bread, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) round the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) great bonnet.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) back to the château; the curfew had tolled for the
laborious villagers of Fleurières, and the street was unlighted and
empty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should have the marquis's manuscript in
half an hour. Mrs. Bread choosing not to go in by the great gate, they
passed round by a winding lane to a door in the wall of the park, of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) had the key, and which would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) to enter the château
from behind. Newman arranged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should await outside the
wall her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) return with the coveted document.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) went in, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) half hour in the dusky lane seemed very long. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had plenty to think about. At last the door in the wall opened and
Mrs. Bread stood there, with one hand on the latch and the other holding
out a scrap of white paper, folded small. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was master of
it, and it had passed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waistcoat pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Come and see me in
Paris,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we are to settle your future, you know; and I will
translate poor M. de Bellegarde's French to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt so
grateful as at this moment for M. Nioche's instructions.

<p/>Mrs. Bread's dull eyes had followed the disappearance of the paper, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave a heavy sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Well, you have done what you would with me, sir,
and I suppose you will do it again. You _must_ take care of me now. You
are a terribly positive gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I'm a terribly impatient gentleman!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) good-night and walked rapidly back to the inn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
vehicle to be prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) return to Poitiers, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shut
the door of the common salle and strode toward the solitary lamp on the
chimney-piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pulled out the paper and quickly unfolded it. It was
covered with pencil-marks, which at first, in the feeble light, seemed
indistinct. But Newman's fierce curiosity forced a meaning from the
tremulous signs. The English of them was as follows:--

<p/>``My wife has tried to kill me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has done it; I am dying, dying
horribly. It is to marry my dear daughter to M. de Cintré. With all my
soul I protest,--I forbid it. I am not insane,--ask the doctors, ask
Mrs. B--. It was alone with me here, to-night; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) attacked me and put
me to death. It is murder, if murder ever was. Ask the doctors.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``HENRI-URBAIN DE BELLEGARDE''



 (<font color='red'><b>BELLEGARDE CHAPTER XXIII Newman</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXIII

<p/>Newman returned to Paris the second day after his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) interview with Mrs.
Bread. The morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had spent at Poitiers, reading over and over again
the little document which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had lodged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book, and thinking
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would do in the circumstances and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
not have said that Poitiers was an amusing place; yet the day seemed
very short. Domiciled once more in the Boulevard Haussmann, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked
over to the Rue de l’Université and inquired of Madame de Bellegarde's
portress whether the marquise had come back. The portress told him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had arrived, with M. le Marquis, on the preceding day, and further
informed him (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>marquise</b></font>) desired to enter, Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
son were both at home. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said these words the little white-faced
old woman who peered out of the dusky gate-house of the Hôtel de
Bellegarde gave a small wicked smile--a smile which seemed to Newman
to mean, <div class="bookquote">``Go in if you dare!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was evidently versed in the current
domestic history; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was placed where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could feel the pulse of the
house. Newman stood a moment, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) moustache and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>);
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) abruptly turned away. But this was not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was afraid
to go in--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) doubted whether, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should be able
to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way, unchallenged, into the presence of Madame de Cintré's
relatives. Confidence--excessive confidence, perhaps--quite as much as
timidity prompted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) retreat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thunderbolt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) loved
it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was unwilling to part with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to be holding it aloft
in the rumbling, vaguely-flashing air, directly over the heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
victims, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could see their pale, upturned faces. Few
specimens of the human countenance had ever given him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) such pleasure
as these, lighted in the lurid fashion I have hinted at, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
disposed to sip the cup of contemplative revenge in a leisurely fashion.
It must be added, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was at a loss to see exactly how he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could
arrange to witness the operation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thunder. To send in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) card to
Madame de Bellegarde would be a waste of ceremony; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would certainly
decline to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). On the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) could not force his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) way
into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) presence. It annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) keenly to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) might be
reduced to the blind satisfaction of writing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a letter; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
consoled himself in a measure with the reflection that a letter might
lead to an interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) went home, and feeling rather tired--nursing a
vengeance was, it must be confessed, a rather fatiguing process; it
took a good deal out of one--flung himself into one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) brocaded
fauteuils, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) legs, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) pockets, and,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) watched the reflected sunset fading from the ornate house-tops
on the opposite side of the Boulevard, began mentally to compose a cool
epistle to Madame de Bellegarde. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was so occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) servant
threw open the door and announced ceremoniously, <div class="bookquote">``Madame Brett!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman roused himself, expectantly, and in a few moments perceived upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) threshold the worthy woman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had conversed to such good
purpose on the starlit hill-top of Fleurières. Mrs. Bread had made for
this visit the same toilet as for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former expedition. Newman was
struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) distinguished appearance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lamp was not lit, and as
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large, grave face gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) through the light dusk from under
the shadow of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ample bonnet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt the incongruity of such a person
presenting herself as a servant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with high geniality and
bade her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come in and sit down and make herself comfortable. There was
something which might have touched the springs both of mirth and of
melancholy in the ancient maidenliness with which Mrs. Bread endeavored
to comply with these directions. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not playing at being fluttered,
which would have been simply ridiculous; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) best to carry
herself as a person so humble that, for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), even embarrassment would
have been pretentious; but evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never dreamed of its being
in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) horoscope to pay a visit, at night-fall, to a friendly single
gentleman who lived in theatrical-looking rooms on one of the new
Boulevards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I truly hope I am not forgetting my place, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgetting your place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Why, you are remembering it.
This is your place, you know. You are already in my service; your wages,
as housekeeper, began a fortnight ago. I can tell you my house wants
keeping! Why don't you take off your bonnet and stay?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take off my bonnet?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, with timid literalness. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir,
I haven't my cap. And with your leave, sir, I couldn't keep house in my
best gown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind your gown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``You shall have a
better gown than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread stared solemnly and then stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
lustreless satin skirt, as if the perilous side of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) situation were
defining itself. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, I am fond of my own clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you have left those wicked people, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, here I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``That's all I can tell you.
Here I sit, poor Catherine Bread. It's a strange place for me to be. I
don't know myself; I never supposed I was so bold. But indeed, sir, I
have gone as far as my own strength will bear me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, Mrs. Bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, almost caressingly, <div class="bookquote">``don't make
yourself uncomfortable. Now's the time to feel lively, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to speak again with a trembling voice. <div class="bookquote">``I think it would be
more respectable if I could--if I could'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice trembled to a
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you could give up this sort of thing altogether?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman
kindly, trying to anticipate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meaning, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) supposed might be a
wish to retire from service.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I could give up everything, sir! All I should ask is a decent
Protestant burial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burial!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman, with a burst of laughter. <div class="bookquote">``Why, to bury you now
would be a sad piece of extravagance. It's only rascals who have to be
buried to get respectable. Honest folks like you and me can live our
time out--and live together. Come! Did you bring your baggage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My box is locked and corded; but I haven't yet spoken to my lady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), then, and have done with it. I should like to have your
chance!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would gladly give it you, sir. I have passed some weary hours in my
lady's dressing-room; but this will be one of the longest. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will tax
me with ingratitude.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``so long as you can tax her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with murder--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, I can't; not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say anything about it? So much the better. Leave that
to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) calls me a thankless old woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, <div class="bookquote">``I shall have
nothing to say. But it is better so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) softly added. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall be my
lady to the last. That will be more respectable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you will come to me and I shall be your gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said
Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that will be more respectable still!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread rose, with lowered eyes, and stood a moment; then, looking
up, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes upon Newman's face. The disordered proprieties
were somehow settling to rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at Newman so long and so
fixedly, with such a dull, intense devotedness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) himself might
have had a pretext for embarrassment. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said gently, <div class="bookquote">``You are
not looking well, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's natural enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing to feel well
about. To be very indifferent and very fierce, very dull and very
jovial, very sick and very lively, all at once,--why, it rather mixes
one up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread gave a noiseless sigh. <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you something that will
make you feel duller still, if you want to feel all one way. About
Madame de Cintré.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman demanded. <div class="bookquote">``Not that you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, sir, nor ever shall. That's the
dullness of it. Nor my lady. Nor M. de Bellegarde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is kept so close.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Close, close,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, very softly.

<p/>These words, for an instant, seemed to check the beating of Newman's
heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chair, staring up at the old woman. <div class="bookquote">``They
have tried to see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wouldn't--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) refused--forever! I had it from my lady's own maid,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bread, <div class="bookquote">``who had it from my lady. To speak of it to such a person my lady
must have felt the shock. Madame de Cintré won't see them now, and now
is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only chance. A while hence she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will have no chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the other women--the mothers, the daughters, the sisters; what
is it they call them?--won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is what they call the rule of the house,--or of the order, I
believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``There is no rule so strict as that of the
Carmelites. The bad women in the reformatories are fine ladies to them.
They wear old brown cloaks--so the _femme de chambre_ told me--that you
wouldn't use for a horse blanket. And the poor countess was so fond of
soft-feeling dresses; she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) would never have anything stiff! They sleep on
the ground,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread went on; <div class="bookquote">``they are no better, no better,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hesitated for a comparison,--<div class="bookquote">``they are no better than tinkers'
wives. They give up everything, down to the very name their poor old
nurses called them by. They give up father and mother, brother and
sister,--to say nothing of other persons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bread delicately added.
<div class="bookquote">``They wear a shroud under their brown cloaks and a rope round their
waists, and they get up on winter nights and go off into cold places to
pray to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary is a hard mistress!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread, dwelling on these terrible facts, sat dry-eyed and pale,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands clasped in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) satin lap. Newman gave a melancholy
groan and fell forward, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands. There was a long
silence, broken only by the ticking of the great gilded clock on the
chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is this place--where is the convent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked at last,
looking up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two houses,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread. <div class="bookquote">``I found out; I thought you
would like to know--though it's poor comfort, I think. One is in the
Avenue de Messine; they have learned that Madame de Cintré is there. The
other is in the Rue d’Enfer. That's a terrible name; I suppose you know
what it means.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman got up and walked away to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) long room. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came
back Mrs. Bread had got up, and stood by the fire with folded hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Can I get near her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--even if I don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?
Can I look through a grating, or some such thing, at the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>all women</b></font>)</div><p/>It is said that all women love a lover, and Mrs. Bread's sense of the
pre-established harmony which kept servants in their <div class="bookquote">``place,''  (<font color='red'><b>servants</b></font>)</div>even
as planets in their orbits -LRB-not that Mrs. Bread had ever consciously
likened herself to a planet-RRB-, barely availed to temper the maternal
melancholy with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head on one side and gazed at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) new employer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) probably felt for the moment as if, forty years
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had held him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) also in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">``That wouldn't help you, sir.
It would only make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seem farther away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to go there, at all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Avenue de Messine,
you say? And what is it they call themselves?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Carmelites,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall remember that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bread hesitated a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``It's my duty to tell you
this, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``The convent has a chapel, and some people are
admitted on Sunday to the mass. You don't see the poor creatures that
are shut up there, but I am told you can hear them sing. It's a wonder
they have any heart for singing! Some Sunday I shall make bold to go. It
seems to me I should know _her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ voice in fifty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitor very gratefully; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand
and shook hers. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``If anyone can get in, I will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A moment later Mrs. Bread proposed, deferentially, to retire, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and put a lighted candle into her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``There are half a
dozen rooms there I don't use,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, pointing through an open door.
<div class="bookquote">``Go and look at them and take your choice. You can live in the one
you like best.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>From this bewildering opportunity Mrs. Bread at first
recoiled; but finally, yielding to Newman's gentle, reassuring push, she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
wandered off into the dusk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tremulous taper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remained absent
a quarter of an hour, during which Newman paced up and down, stopped
occasionally to look out of the window at the lights on the Boulevard,
and then resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walk. Mrs. Bread's relish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) investigation
apparently increased as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) proceeded; but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reappeared and
deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) candlestick on the chimney-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, have you picked one out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>asked Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A room, sir? They are all too fine for a dingy old body like me. There
isn't one that hasn't a bit of gilding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's only tinsel, Mrs. Bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``If you stay there a while
it will all peel off of itself.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave a dismal smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, there are things enough peeling off already!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs.
Bread, with a head-shake. <div class="bookquote">``Since I was there I thought I would look
about me. I don't believe you know, sir. The corners are most dreadful.
You do want a housekeeper, that you do; you want a tidy Englishwoman
that isn't above taking hold of a broom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) suspected, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not measured, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
domestic abuses, and that to reform them was a mission worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
powers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) candlestick aloft again and looked around the salon
with compassionate glances; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) intimated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) accepted the
mission, and that its sacred character would sustain her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rupture
with Madame de Bellegarde. With this she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) curtsied herself away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) came back the next day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) worldly goods, and Newman, going
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) drawing-room, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) aged knees before a divan,
sewing up some detached fringe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leave-taking
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) late mistress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said it had proved easier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
feared. <div class="bookquote">``I was perfectly civil, sir, but the Lord helped me to remember
that a good woman has no call to tremble before a bad one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``And does she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) know you have come to
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked me where I was going, and I mentioned your name,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say to that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at me very hard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned very red. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bade me
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I was all ready to go, and I had got the coachman, who is an
Englishman, to bring down my poor box and to fetch me a cab. But when I
went down myself to the gate I found it closed. My lady had sent orders
to the porter not to let me pass, and by the same orders the porter's
wife--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is a dreadful sly old body--had gone out in a cab to fetch
home M. de Bellegarde from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) club.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knee. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) _is_ scared! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) _is_ scared!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cried,
exultantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was frightened too, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bread, <div class="bookquote">``but I was also mightily
vexed. I took it very high with the porter and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) by what right
he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) used violence to an honorable Englishwoman who had lived in the house
for thirty years before he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was heard of. Oh, sir, I was very grand, and
I brought the man down. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bolts and let me out, and I promised
the cabman something handsome if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would drive fast. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
terribly slow; it seemed as if we should never reach your blessed door.
I am all of a tremble still; it took me five minutes, just now, to
thread my needle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman told her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), with a gleeful laugh, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) chose she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might
have a little maid on purpose to thread her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) needles; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went away
murmuring to himself again that the old woman _was_ scared--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) _was_
scared!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not shown Mrs. Tristram the little paper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) carried in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book, but since his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) return to Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) several
times, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) to be in a strange
way--an even stranger way than his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sad situation made natural. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
disappointment gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head? He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked like a man who was going to
be ill, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) more restless and active. One day
he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would sit hanging his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head and looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were firmly resolved
never to smile again; another he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would indulge in laughter that was
almost unseemly and make jokes that were bad even for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was
trying to carry off his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sorrow, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) at such times really went too far.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) of all things not to be <div class="bookquote">``strange.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Feeling in a measure
responsible as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) did for the affair which had turned out so ill
for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) could endure anything but his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) strangeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might be
melancholy if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would, or he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might be stoical; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) might be cross and
cantankerous with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had ever dared to meddle
with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) destiny: to this she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would submit; for this she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would make
allowances. Only, for Heaven's sake, let him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) not be incoherent. That
would be extremely unpleasant. It was like people talking in their
sleep; they always frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). And Mrs. Tristram intimated that,
taking very high ground as regards the moral obligation which events
had laid upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) proposed not to rest quiet until she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) should have
confronted him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with the least inadequate substitute for Madame de Cintré
that the two hemispheres contained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``we are even now, and we had better not open a new
account! You may bury me some day, but you shall never marry me. It's
too rough. I hope, at any rate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that there is nothing
incoherent in this--that I want to go next Sunday to the Carmelite
chapel in the Avenue de Messine. You know one of the Catholic
ministers--an abbé, is that it?--I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) here, you know; that
motherly old gentleman with the big waistband. Please ask him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) if I need
a special leave to go in, and if I do, beg him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to obtain it for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram gave expression to the liveliest joy. <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad you
have asked me to do something!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``You shall get into the
chapel if the abbé is disfrocked for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) share in it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And two days
afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that it was all arranged; the abbé was enchanted
to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would present himself civilly at the convent
gate there would be no difficulty.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIV

<p/>Sunday was as yet two days off; but meanwhile, to beguile his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
impatience, Newman took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way to the Avenue de Messine and got
what comfort he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could in staring at the blank outer wall of Madame de
Cintré's present residence. The street in question, as some travelers
will remember, adjoins the Parc Monceau, which is one of the prettiest
corners of Paris. The quarter has an air of modern opulence and
convenience which seems at variance with the ascetic institution,
and the impression made upon Newman's gloomily-irritated gaze by the
fresh-looking, windowless expanse behind which the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) loved was
perhaps even then pledging herself to pass the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) days was less
exasperating than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had feared. The place suggested a convent with the
modern improvements--an asylum in which privacy, though unbroken,
might be not quite identical with privation, and meditation, though
monotonous, might be of a cheerful cast. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew the case was
otherwise; only at present it was not a reality to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). It was too
strange and too mocking to be real; it was like a page torn out of a
romance, with no context in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own experience.

<p/>On Sunday morning, at the hour which Mrs. Tristram had indicated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
rang at the gate in the blank wall. It instantly opened and admitted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) into a clean, cold-looking court, from beyond which a dull, plain
edifice looked down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). A robust lay sister with a cheerful
complexion emerged from a porter's lodge, and, on his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) stating his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
errand, pointed to the open door of the chapel, an edifice which
occupied the right side of the court and was preceded by the high flight
of steps. Newman ascended the steps and immediately entered the open
door. Service had not yet begun; the place was dimly lighted, and it was
some moments before he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could distinguish its features. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw it
was divided by a large close iron screen into two unequal portions.
The altar was on the hither side of the screen, and between it and the
entrance were disposed several benches and chairs. Three or four of
these were occupied by vague, motionless figures--figures that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
presently perceived to be women, deeply absorbed in their devotion. The
place seemed to Newman very cold; the smell of the incense itself was
cold. Besides this there was a twinkle of tapers and here and there a
glow of colored glass. Newman seated himself; the praying women kept
still, with their backs turned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw they were visitors like himself
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have liked to see their faces; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) believed that they
were the mourning mothers and sisters of other women who had had the
same pitiless courage as Madame de Cintré. But they were better off
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), for they at least shared the faith to which the others had
sacrificed themselves. Three or four persons came in; two of them were
elderly gentlemen. Everyone was very quiet. Newman fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes
upon the screen behind the altar. That was the convent, the real
convent, the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could see nothing; no light
came through the crevices. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up and approached the partition very
gently, trying to look through. But behind it there was darkness, with
nothing stirring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place, and after that a priest and
two altar boys came in and began to say mass.

<p/>Newman watched their genuflections and gyrations with a grim, still
enmity; they seemed aids and abettors of Madame de Cintré's desertion;
they were mouthing and droning out their triumph. The priest's long,
dismal intonings acted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) nerves and deepened his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) wrath; there
was something defiant in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) unintelligible drawl; it seemed meant for
Newman himself. Suddenly there arose from the depths of the chapel, from
behind the inexorable grating, a sound which drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attention from
the altar--the sound of a strange, lugubrious chant, uttered by women's
voices. It began softly, but it presently grew louder, and as it
increased it became more of a wail and a dirge. It was the chant of
the Carmelite nuns, their only human utterance. It was their dirge over
their buried affections and over the vanity of earthly desires. At first
Newman was bewildered--almost stunned--by the strangeness of the sound;
then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) comprehended its meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) listened intently and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heart
began to throb. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) listened for Madame de Cintré's voice, and in the
very heart of the tuneless harmony he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made it out. -LRB-We are
obliged to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was wrong, inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had obviously not
yet had time to become a member of the invisible sisterhood.-RRB- The
chant kept on, mechanical and monotonous, with dismal repetitions and
despairing cadences. It was hideous, it was horrible; as it continued,
Newman felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) needed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) self-control. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was growing more
agitated; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes. At last, as in its full force the
thought came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that this confused, impersonal wail was all that
either he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) or the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had deserted should ever hear of the voice
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had found so sweet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could bear it no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rose
abruptly and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way out. On the threshold he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused, listened
again to the dreary strain, and then hastily descended into the court.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did so he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw the good sister with the high-colored cheeks and the
fanlike frill to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) coiffure, who had admitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), was in conference
at the gate with two persons who had just come in. A second glance
informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that these persons were Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son,
and that they were about to avail themselves of that method of approach
to Madame de Cintré which Newman had found but a mockery of consolation.
As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) crossed the court M. de Bellegarde recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>); the marquis was
coming to the steps, leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother. The old lady also gave Newman
a look, and it resembled that of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son. Both faces expressed a franker
perturbation, something more akin to the humbleness of dismay, than
Newman had yet seen in them. Evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) startled the Bellegardes, and
they had not their grand behavior immediately in hand. Newman hurried
past them, guided only by the desire to get out of the convent walls and
into the street. The gate opened itself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) approach; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) strode over
the threshold and it closed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). A carriage which appeared to
have been standing there, was just turning away from the sidewalk.
Newman looked at it for a moment, blankly; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) became conscious,
through the dusky mist that swam before his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes, that a lady seated in
it was bowing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). The vehicle had turned away before he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) recognized
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); it was an ancient landau with one half the cover lowered. The
lady's bow was very positive and accompanied with a smile; a little girl
was seated beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat, and then the lady bade the
coachman stop. The carriage halted again beside the pavement, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sat there and beckoned to Newman--beckoned with the demonstrative grace
of Madame Urbain de Bellegarde. Newman hesitated a moment before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) summons, during this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had time to curse his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
stupidity for letting the others escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been wondering how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could get at them; fool that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was for not stopping them then and
there! What better place than beneath the very prison walls to which
they had consigned the promise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) joy? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been too bewildered
to stop them, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt ready to wait for them at the gate. Madame
Urbain, with a certain attractive petulance, beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again, and
this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went over to the carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) leaned out and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
hand, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) kindly, and smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, monsieur,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you don't include me in your wrath? I had
nothing to do with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't suppose _you_ could have prevented it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered in
a tone which was not that of studied gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you say is too true for me to resent the small account it makes of
my influence. I forgive you, at any rate, because you look as if you had
seen a ghost.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad, then, I didn't go in with Madame de Bellegarde and my
husband. You must have seen them, eh? Was the meeting affectionate?
Did you hear the chanting? They say it's like the lamentations of the
damned. I wouldn't go in: one is certain to hear that soon enough. Poor
Claire--in a white shroud and a big brown cloak! That's the _toilette_
of the Carmelites, you know. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was always fond of long, loose
things. But I must not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) to you; only I must say that I am
very sorry for you, that if I could have helped you I would, and that
I think everyone has been very shabby. I was afraid of it, you know; I
felt it in the air for a fortnight before it came. When I saw you at
my mother-in-law's ball, taking it all so easily, I felt as if you were
dancing on your grave. But what could I do? I wish you all the good I
can think of. You will say that isn't much! Yes; they have been very
shabby; I am not a bit afraid to say it; I assure you everyone thinks
so. We are not all like that. I am sorry I am not going to see you
again; you know I think you very good company. I would prove it by
asking you to get into the carriage and drive with me for a quarter
of an hour, while I wait for my mother-in-law. Only if we were
seen--considering what has passed, and everyone knows you have been
turned away--it might be thought I was going a little too far, even for
me. But I shall see you sometimes--somewhere, eh? You know'' (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>--this was
said in English--<div class="bookquote">``we have a plan for a little amusement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stood there with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand on the carriage-door listening to this
consolatory murmur with an unlighted eye. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hardly knew what Madame
de Bellegarde was saying; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was only conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was chattering
ineffectively. But suddenly it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) that, with her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pretty
professions, there was a way of making her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) effective; she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) might help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to get at the old woman and the marquis. <div class="bookquote">``They are coming back
soon--your companions?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You are waiting for them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They will hear the mass out; there is nothing to keep them longer.
Claire has refused to see them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``and you can help me, you can do
me a favor. Delay your return for five minutes and give me a chance at
them. I will wait for them here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands with a tender grimace. <div class="bookquote">``My poor
friend, what do you want to do to them? To beg them to come back to you?
It will be wasted words. They will never come back!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to them, all the same. Pray do what I ask you. Stay
away and leave them to me for five minutes; you needn't be afraid; I
shall not be violent; I am very quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you look very quiet! If they had _le cœur tendre_ you would move
them. But they haven't! However, I will do better for you than what you
propose. The understanding is not that I shall come back for them. I am
going into the Parc Monceau with my little girl to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a walk, and
my mother-in-law, who comes so rarely into this quarter, is to profit
by the same opportunity to take the air. We are to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) in the
park, where my husband is to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) to us. Follow me now; just within
the gates I shall get out of my carriage. Sit down on a chair in some
quiet corner and I will bring them near you. There's devotion for you!
_Le reste vous regarde_.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>This proposal seemed to Newman extremely felicitous; it revived his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
drooping spirit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reflected that Madame Urbain was not such a
goose as she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) seemed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) promised immediately to overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), and the
carriage drove away.

<p/>The Parc Monceau is a very pretty piece of landscape-gardening, but
Newman, passing into it, bestowed little attention upon its elegant
vegetation, which was full of the freshness of spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found Madame
de Bellegarde promptly, seated in one of the quiet corners of which she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
had spoken, while before her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), in the alley, her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) little girl, attended by
the footman and the lap-dog, walked up and down as if she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) were taking a
lesson in deportment. Newman sat down beside the mamma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) talked
a great deal, apparently with the design of convincing him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that--if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would only see it--poor dear Claire did not belong to the most
fascinating type of woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was too tall and thin, too stiff and
cold; her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) mouth was too wide and her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) nose too narrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) had no dimples
anywhere. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was eccentric, eccentric in cold blood; she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) was
an Anglaise, after all. Newman was very impatient; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was counting the
minutes until his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) victims should reappear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat silent, leaning upon
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cane, looking absently and insensibly at the little marquise. At
length Madame de Bellegarde said she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) would walk toward the gate of the
park and meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) companions; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) eyes,
and, after playing a moment with the lace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) sleeve, looked up again
at Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``the promise you made me three weeks
ago?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, as Newman, vainly consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) memory, was obliged to
confess that the promise had escaped it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>), at the time, a very queer answer--an answer at which, viewing it
in the light of the sequel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) had fair ground for taking offense.
<div class="bookquote">``You promised to take me to Bullier's after your marriage. After your
marriage--you made a great point of that. Three days after that your
marriage was broken off. Do you know, when I heard the news, the
first thing I said to myself? `Oh heaven, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) won't go with me to
Bullier's!' And I really began to wonder if you had not been expecting
the rupture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>murmured Newman, looking down the path to see if the
others were not coming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be good-natured,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. <div class="bookquote">``One must not ask
too much of a gentleman who is in love with a cloistered nun. Besides,
I can't go to Bullier's while we are in mourning. But I haven't given
it up for that. The _partie_ is arranged; I have my cavalier. Lord
Deepmere, if you please! He (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) has gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) dear Dublin; but a
few months hence I am to name any evening and he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) will come over from
Ireland, on purpose. That's what I call gallantry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Shortly after this Madame de Bellegarde walked away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) little
girl. Newman sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place; the time seemed terribly long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt
how fiercely his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) quarter of an hour in the convent chapel had raked
over the glowing coals of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) resentment. Madame de Bellegarde kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
waiting, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) proved as good as her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) word. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) reappeared at
the end of the path, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) little girl and her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) footman; beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>)
slowly walked her (<font color='blue'><b>Claire</b></font>) husband, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm. They were a long
time advancing, during which Newman sat unmoved. Tingling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
with passion, it was extremely characteristic of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was able
to moderate his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) expression of it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have turned down a flaring
gas-burner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) native coolness, shrewdness, and deliberateness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
life-long submissiveness to the sentiment that words were acts and acts
were steps in life, and that in this matter of taking steps
curveting and prancing were exclusively reserved for quadrupeds
and foreigners--all this admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that rightful wrath had no
connection with being a fool and indulging in spectacular violence. So
as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) rose, when old Madame de Bellegarde and her (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) son were close to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) only felt very tall and light. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had been sitting beside some
shrubbery, in such a way as not to be noticeable at a distance; but M.
de Bellegarde had evidently already perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
were holding their course, but Newman stepped in front of them, and they
were obliged to pause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat slightly, and looked at them
for a moment; they were pale with amazement and disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me for stopping you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said in a low tone, <div class="bookquote">``but I must profit
by the occasion. I have ten words to say to you. Will you listen to
them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) and then turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">``Can Mr. Newman
possibly have anything to say that is worth our listening to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you I have something,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``besides, it is my duty to
say it. It's a notification--a warning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your duty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said old Madame de Bellegarde, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thin lips curving like
scorched paper. <div class="bookquote">``That is your affair, not ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Urbain meanwhile had seized her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little girl by the hand, with a
gesture of surprise and impatience which struck Newman, intent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own words, with its dramatic effectiveness. <div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Newman is
going to make a scene in public,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I will take my poor
child out of the _mêlée_. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is too young to see such naughtiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) instantly resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had much better listen to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman went on. <div class="bookquote">``Whether you do or
not, things will be disagreeable for you; but at any rate you will be
prepared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have already heard something of your threats,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis,
<div class="bookquote">``and you know what we think of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think a good deal more than you admit. A moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added in
reply to an exclamation of the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``I remember perfectly that we
are in a public place, and you see I am very quiet. I am not going to
tell your secret to the passers-by; I shall keep it, to begin with, for
certain picked listeners. Anyone who observes us will think that we are
having a friendly chat, and that I am complimenting you, madam, on your
venerable virtues.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis gave three short sharp raps on the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stick. <div class="bookquote">``I
demand of you to step out of our path!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hissed.

<p/>Newman instantly complied, and M. de Bellegarde stepped forward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
mother. Then Newman said, <div class="bookquote">``Half an hour hence Madame de Bellegarde will
regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) didn't learn exactly what I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquise had taken a few steps, but at these words she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused,
looking at Newman with eyes like two scintillating globules of ice. <div class="bookquote">``You
are like a peddler with something to sell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, with a little cold
laugh which only partially concealed the tremor in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, not to sell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined; <div class="bookquote">``I give it to you for nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) approached nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), looking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) straight in the eyes. <div class="bookquote">``You
killed your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, almost in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``That is, you tried
once and failed, and then, without trying, you succeeded.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde closed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes and gave a little cough, which, as
a piece of dissimulation, struck Newman as really heroic. <div class="bookquote">``Dear mother,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis, <div class="bookquote">``does this stuff amuse you so much?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rest is more amusing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``You had better not lose it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde opened her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes; the scintillations had gone out of
them; they were fixed and dead. But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) smiled superbly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) narrow
little lips, and repeated Newman's word. <div class="bookquote">``Amusing? Have I killed someone
else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't count your daughter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``though I might! Your
husband knew what you were doing. I have a proof of it whose existence
you have never suspected.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned to the marquis, who was
terribly white--whiter than Newman had ever seen anyone out of a
picture. <div class="bookquote">``A paper written by the hand, and signed with the name, of
Henri-Urbain de Bellegarde. Written after you, madam, had left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for
dead, and while you, sir, had gone--not very fast--for the doctor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away, looking vaguely round
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I must sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said in a low tone, going toward the bench
on which Newman had been sitting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Couldn't you have spoken to me alone?''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis to Newman, with
a strange look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes, if I could have been sure of speaking to your mother alone,
too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered. <div class="bookquote">``But I have had to take you as I could get you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde, with a movement very eloquent of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
have called her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``grit,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) steel-cold pluck and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) instinctive appeal
to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own personal resources, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's arm and
went and seated herself upon the bench. There she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remained, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
hands folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap, looking straight at Newman. The expression of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fancied at first that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was smiling; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
went and stood in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elegant features were
distorted by agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw, however, equally, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was resisting
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation with all the rigor of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inflexible will, and there was
nothing like either fear or submission in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stony stare. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been
startled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not terrified. Newman had an exasperating feeling
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) still; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not have believed
it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could so utterly fail to be touched by the sight of
a woman -LRB-criminal or other-RRB- in so tight a place. Madame de Bellegarde
gave a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son which seemed tantamount to an injunction to be
silent and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own devices. The marquis stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),
with his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>), looking at Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What paper is this you speak of?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked the old lady, with an imitation
of tranquillity which would have been applauded in a veteran actress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly what I have told you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``A paper written by your
husband after you had left him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for dead, and during the couple of hours
before you returned. You see he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had the time; you shouldn't have stayed
away so long. It declares distinctly his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's murderous intent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>Madame de Bellegarde observed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I have taken a copy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
drew from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) waistcoat pocket a small, folded sheet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it to my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde. Newman handed it to the
marquis, whose mother, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), said simply, <div class="bookquote">``Look at it.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>M. de
Bellegarde's eyes had a pale eagerness which it was useless for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) to
try to dissimulate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) took the paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) light-gloved fingers and
opened it. There was a silence, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) read it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had more
than time to read it, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said nothing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) stood staring at it.
<div class="bookquote">``Where is the original?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>asked Madame de Bellegarde, in a voice which
was really a consummate negation of impatience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a very safe place. Of course I can't show you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``You might want to take hold of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added with conscious quaintness.
<div class="bookquote">``But that's a very correct copy--except, of course, the handwriting. I
am keeping the original to show someone else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde at last looked up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) eyes were still very eager.
<div class="bookquote">``To whom do you mean to show it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'm thinking of beginning with the duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``that
stout lady I saw at your ball. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked me to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), you
know. I thought at the moment I shouldn't have much to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); but
my little document will give us something to talk about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better keep it, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``keep it and show it to your mother when
you get home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And after showing it to the duchess?'' (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>--asked the marquis, folding the
paper and putting it away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I'll take up the dukes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Then the counts and the
barons--all the people you had the cruelty to introduce me to in a
character of which you meant immediately to deprive me. I have made out
a list.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>For a moment neither Madame de Bellegarde nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) son said a word; the
old lady sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes upon the ground; M. de Bellegarde's blanched
pupils were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face. Then, looking at Newman, <div class="bookquote">``Is that all
you have to say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I want to say a few words more. I want to say that I hope you
quite understand what I'm about. This is my revenge, you know. You have
treated me before the world--convened for the express purpose--as if I
were not good enough for you. I mean to show the world that, however bad
I may be, you are not quite the people to say it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame de Bellegarde was silent again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) broke her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) silence.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) self-possession continued to be extraordinary. <div class="bookquote">``I needn't ask you
who has been your accomplice. Mrs. Bread told me that you had purchased
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) services.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't accuse Mrs. Bread of venality,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) has kept your
secret all these years. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) has given you a long respite. It was beneath
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) eyes your husband wrote that paper; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) hands with
a solemn injunction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) was to make it public. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) was too
good-hearted to make use of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady appeared for an instant to hesitate, and then, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bread</b></font>) was my
husband's mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, softly. This was the only concession to
self-defense that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condescended to make.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Madame de Bellegarde got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bench. <div class="bookquote">``It was not to your opinions
I undertook to listen, and if you have nothing left but them to tell
me I think this remarkable interview may terminate.''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>And turning to the
marquis she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arm again. <div class="bookquote">``My son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``say something!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mother, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
forehead, and then, tenderly, caressingly, <div class="bookquote">``What shall I say?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is only one thing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marquise de Bellegarde/Marquise</b></font>)</div>said the Marquise. <div class="bookquote">``That it was really
not worth while to have interrupted our walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>But the marquis thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) could improve this. <div class="bookquote">``Your paper's a forgery,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Marquise</b></font>) said to Newman.

<p/>Newman shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head a little, with a tranquil smile. <div class="bookquote">``M. de
Bellegarde,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``your mother does better. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has done better all
along, from the first of my knowing you. You're a mighty plucky woman,
madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) continued. <div class="bookquote">``It's a great pity you have made me your enemy. I
should have been one of your greatest admirers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``_Mon pauvre ami_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Bellegarde/Young Madame de Bellegarde/Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Bellegarde to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) son in French, and
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not heard these words, <div class="bookquote">``you must take me immediately to my
carriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stepped back and let them leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) watched them a moment and
saw Madame Urbain, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little girl, come out of a by-path to meet
them. The old lady stooped and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) grandchild. <div class="bookquote">``Damn it, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) _is_
plucky!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked home with a slight sense of being
balked. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so inexpressively defiant! But on reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) decided
that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had witnessed was no real sense of security, still less a
real innocence. It was only a very superior style of brazen assurance.
<div class="bookquote">``Wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) reads the paper!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) concluded
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard sooner than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) expected. The next morning, before midday,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was about to give orders for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) breakfast to be served, M. de
Bellegarde's card was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) has read the paper and she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
has passed a bad night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) instantly admitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) visitor,
who came in with the air of the ambassador of a great power meeting the
delegate of a barbarous tribe whom an absurd accident had enabled for
the moment to be abominably annoying. The ambassador, at all events, had
passed a bad night, and his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) faultlessly careful toilet only threw
into relief the frigid rancor in his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) eyes and the mottled tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>)
refined complexion. He (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) stood before Newman a moment, breathing quickly
and softly, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) forefinger curtly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) host pointed to a
chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I have come to say is soon said,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) declared <div class="bookquote">``and can only be
said without ceremony.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am good for as much or for as little as you desire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>The marquis looked round the room a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``On what terms
will you part with your scrap of paper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On none!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And while Newman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head on one side and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sounded the marquis's turbid gaze with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">``Certainly, that is not worth sitting down about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde meditated a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) had not heard Newman's
refusal. <div class="bookquote">``My mother and I, last evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``talked over your
story. You will be surprised to learn that we think your little document
is--a'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) held back his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) word a moment--<div class="bookquote">``is genuine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You forget that with you I am used to surprises!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Newman,
with a laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The very smallest amount of respect that we owe to my father's memory,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>the marquis continued, <div class="bookquote">``makes us desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not be held up to
the world as the author of so--so infernal an attack upon the reputation
of a wife whose only fault was that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been submissive to
accumulated injury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It's for your father's sake.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) laughed
the laugh in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) indulged when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was most amused--a noiseless
laugh, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lips closed.

<p/>But M. de Bellegarde's gravity held good. <div class="bookquote">``There are a few of my
father's particular friends for whom the knowledge of so--so unfortunate
an--inspiration--would be a real grief. Even say we firmly established
by medical evidence the presumption of a mind disordered by fever, _il
en resterait quelque chose_. At the best it would look ill in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Very
ill!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't try medical evidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``Don't touch the doctors and
they won't touch you. I don't mind your knowing that I have not written
to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw signs in M. de Bellegarde's discolored mask
that this information was extremely pertinent. But it may have been
merely fancy; for the marquis remained majestically argumentative. <div class="bookquote">``For
instance, Madame d’Outreville,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``of whom you spoke yesterday. I
can imagine nothing that would shock her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am quite prepared to shock Madame d’Outreville, you know. That's
on the cards. I expect to shock a great many people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde examined for a moment the stitching on the back of one
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gloves. Then, without looking up, <div class="bookquote">``We don't offer you money,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``That we supposed to be useless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, turning away, took a few turns about the room and then came
back. <div class="bookquote">``What _do_ you offer me? By what I can make out, the generosity is
all to be on my side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) arms at his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) side and held his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) head a little
higher. <div class="bookquote">``What we offer you is a chance--a chance that a gentleman should
appreciate. A chance to abstain from inflicting a terrible blot upon the
memory of a man who certainly had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) faults, but who, personally, had
done you no wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are two things to say to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``The first is,
as regards appreciating your `chance,' that you don't consider me a
gentleman. That's your great point you know. It's a poor rule that won't
work both ways. The second is that--well, in a word, you are talking
great nonsense!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, who in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bitterness had, as I have said, kept
well before his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes a certain ideal of saying nothing rude, was
immediately somewhat regretfully conscious of the sharpness of these
words. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) speedily observed that the marquis took them more quietly
than might have been expected. M. de Bellegarde, like the stately
ambassador that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) was, continued the policy of ignoring what was
disagreeable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) adversary's replies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gazed at the gilded
arabesques on the opposite wall, and then presently transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
glance to Newman, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) too were a large grotesque in a rather
vulgar system of chamber-decoration. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know that as regards
yourself it won't do at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean it won't do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course you damn yourself. But I suppose that's in your
programme. You propose to throw mud at us; you believe, you hope, that
some of it may stick. We know, of course, it can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>explained the
marquis in a tone of conscious lucidity; <div class="bookquote">``but you take the chance, and
are willing at any rate to show that you yourself have dirty hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a good comparison; at least half of it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``I
take the chance of something sticking. But as regards my hands, they are
clean. I have taken the matter up with my finger-tips.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde looked a moment into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``All our friends are
quite with us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``They would have done exactly as we have done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall believe that when I hear them say it. Meanwhile I shall think
better of human nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) hat again. <div class="bookquote">``Madame de Cintré was extremely
fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father. If she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) knew of the existence of the few written
words of which you propose to make this scandalous use, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would demand
of you proudly for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake to give it up to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would destroy
it without reading it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will not know. I was in that
convent yesterday and I know what _she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)_ is doing. Lord deliver us! You
can guess whether it made me feel forgiving!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde appeared to have nothing more to suggest; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
continued to stand there, rigid and elegant, as a man who believed that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) mere personal presence had an argumentative value. Newman
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and, without yielding an inch on the main issue, felt an
incongruously good-natured impulse to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to retreat in good order.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your visit's a failure, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You offer too little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Propose something yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>the marquis</b></font>)</div>said the marquis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me back Madame de Cintré in the same state in which you took her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde threw back his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) pale face flushed. <div class="bookquote">``Never!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We wouldn't if we could! In the sentiment which led us to deprecate her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
marriage nothing is changed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>```Deprecate' is good!'' cried Newman. <div class="bookquote">``It was hardly worth while to come
here only to tell me that you are not ashamed of yourselves. I could
have guessed that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The marquis</b></font>)</div><p/>The marquis slowly walked toward the door, and Newman, following, opened
it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What you propose to do will be very disagreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. de Bellegarde/Bellegarde/de Bellegarde</b></font>)</div>M. de
Bellegarde said. <div class="bookquote">``That is very evident. But it will be nothing more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As I understand it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, <div class="bookquote">``that will be quite enough!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>M. de Bellegarde stood for a moment looking on the ground, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
were ransacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) ingenuity to see what else he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) could do to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
father's reputation. Then, with a little cold sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) seemed to signify
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) regretfully surrendered the late marquis to the penalty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
turpitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gave a hardly perceptible shrug, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) neat umbrella
from the servant in the vestibule, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) gentlemanly walk,
passed out. Newman stood listening till he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard the door close; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
slowly exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I ought to begin to be satisfied now!''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXV

<p/>Newman called upon the comical duchess and found her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) at home. An old
gentleman with a high nose and a gold-headed cane was just taking leave
of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made Newman a protracted obeisance as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) retired, and our
hero supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was one of the mysterious grandees with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had shaken hands at Madame de Bellegarde's ball. The duchess, in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)
armchair, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) did not move, with a great flower-pot on one
side of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), a pile of pink-covered novels on the other, and a large
piece of tapestry depending from her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lap, presented an expansive and
imposing front; but her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) aspect was in the highest degree gracious, and
there was nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) manner to check the effusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) confidence.
She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) about flowers and books, getting launched with
marvelous promptitude; about the theatres, about the peculiar
institutions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) native country, about the humidity of Paris about
the pretty complexions of the American ladies, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) impressions
of France and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) opinion of its female inhabitants. All this was a
brilliant monologue on the part of the duchess, who, like many of
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) country-women, was a person of an affirmative rather than an
interrogative cast of mind, who made _mots_ and put them herself into
circulation, and who was apt to offer you a present of a convenient
little opinion, neatly enveloped in the gilt paper of a happy Gallicism.
Newman had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) with a grievance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found himself in an
atmosphere in which apparently no cognizance was taken of grievance; an
atmosphere into which the chill of discomfort had never penetrated,
and which seemed exclusively made up of mild, sweet, stale intellectual
perfumes. The feeling with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had watched Madame d’Outreville at
the treacherous festival of the Bellegardes came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) struck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as a wonderful old lady in a comedy, particularly well up in her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>)
part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed before long that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) no questions about
their common friends; she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) made no allusion to the circumstances under
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) neither feigned ignorance of a
change in these circumstances nor pretended to condole with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) upon it;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) smiled and discoursed and compared the tender-tinted wools of
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tapestry, as if the Bellegardes and their wickedness were not of
this world. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is fighting shy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman to himself; and, having
made the observation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was prompted to observe, farther, how the
duchess would carry off her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) indifference. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) did so in a masterly
manner. There was not a gleam of disguised consciousness in those
small, clear, demonstrative eyes which constituted her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) nearest claim to
personal loveliness, there was not a symptom of apprehension that Newman
would trench upon the ground she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) proposed to avoid. <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,
she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does it very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tacitly commented. <div class="bookquote">``They all hold together
bravely, and, whether anyone else can trust them or not, they can
certainly trust each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman, at this juncture, fell to admiring the duchess for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) fine
manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt, most accurately, that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was not a grain less urbane
than she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) would have been if his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) marriage were still in prospect; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt also that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) was not a particle more urbane. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come,
so reasoned the duchess--Heaven knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come, after what had
happened; and for the half hour, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) would be _charmante_.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) would never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) again. Finding no ready-made opportunity to
tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) story, Newman pondered these things more dispassionately than
might have been expected; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs, as usual, and even
chuckled a little, appreciatively and noiselessly. And then as the
duchess went on relating a _mot_ with which her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) mother had snubbed the
great Napoleon, it occurred to Newman that her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) evasion of a chapter of
French history more interesting to himself might possibly be the result
of an extreme consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feelings. Perhaps it was delicacy on
the duchess's part--not policy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was on the point of saying something
himself, to make the chance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had determined to give her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) still
better, when the servant announced another visitor. The duchess, on
hearing the name--it was that of an Italian prince--gave a little
imperceptible pout, and said to Newman, rapidly: <div class="bookquote">``I beg you to remain;
I desire this visit to be short.''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman said to himself, at this, that
Madame d’Outreville intended, after all, that they should discuss the
Bellegardes together.

<p/>The prince was a short, stout man, with a head disproportionately large.
He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had a dusky complexion and a bushy eyebrow, beneath which his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>)
eye wore a fixed and somewhat defiant expression; he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) seemed to be
challenging you to insinuate that he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) was top-heavy. The duchess, judging
from her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) charge to Newman, regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) as a bore; but this was not
apparent from the unchecked flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) made a
fresh series of _mots_, characterized with great felicity the Italian
intellect and the taste of the figs at Sorrento, predicted the ultimate
future of the Italian kingdom -LRB-disgust with the brutal Sardinian rule
and complete reversion, throughout the peninsula, to the sacred sway of
the Holy Father-RRB-, and, finally, gave a history of the love affairs of
the Princess X--. This narrative provoked some rectifications on the
part of the prince, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) said, pretended to know something about
that matter; and having satisfied himself that Newman was in no laughing
mood, either with regard to the size of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head or anything else, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
entered into the controversy with an animation for which the duchess,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) down as a bore, could not have been prepared. The
sentimental vicissitudes of the Princess X-- led to a discussion of
the heart history of Florentine nobility in general; the duchess had
spent five weeks in Florence and had gathered much information on the
subject. This was merged, in turn, in an examination of the Italian
heart _per se_. The duchess took a brilliantly heterodox view--thought
it the least susceptible organ of its kind that she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) had ever
encountered, related examples of its want of susceptibility, and at
last declared that for her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) the Italians were a people of ice. The prince
became flame to refute her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) visit really proved charming. Newman
was naturally out of the conversation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head a little
on one side, watching the interlocutors. The duchess, as she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) talked,
frequently looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) with a smile, as if to intimate, in the
charming manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) nation, that it lay only with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to say
something very much to the point. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said nothing at all, and at
last his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts began to wander. A singular feeling came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)--a
sudden sense of the folly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) errand. What under the sun had he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to
say to the duchess, after all? Wherein would it profit him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to tell
her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) that the Bellegardes were traitors and that the old lady, into the
bargain was a murderess? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed morally to have turned a sort of
somersault, and to find things looking differently in consequence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
felt a sudden stiffening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) will and quickening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) reserve. What
in the world had he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) been thinking of when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fancied the duchess could
help him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and that it would conduce to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) comfort to make her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) think ill
of the Bellegardes? What did her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) opinion of the Bellegardes matter to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)? It was only a shade more important than the opinion the Bellegardes
entertained of her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>). The duchess help him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)--that cold, stout, soft,
artificial woman help him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)?--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who in the last twenty minutes had built
up between them a wall of polite conversation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) evidently
flattered herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would never find a gate. Had it come to
that--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was asking favors of conceited people, and appealing for
sympathy where he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no sympathy to give? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
knees, and sat for some minutes staring into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did so his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
ears tingled--he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come very near being an ass. Whether or no the
duchess would hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wouldn't tell it. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to sit
there another half hour for the sake of exposing the Bellegardes? The
Bellegardes be hanged! He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up abruptly, and advanced to shake hands
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hostess.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't stay longer?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) asked very graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then, <div class="bookquote">``I had an idea you had something
particular to say to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) declared.

<p/>Newman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt a little dizzy; for the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed
to be turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) somersault again. The little Italian prince came to
his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) help: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, madam, who has not that?''  (<font color='red'><b>The prince</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) softly sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't teach Mr. Newman to say _fadaises_,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess. <div class="bookquote">``It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
merit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) doesn't know how.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I don't know how to say _fadaises_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``and I don't
want to say anything unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you are very considerate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>said the duchess with a smile; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a little nod for good-bye with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) departure.

<p/>Once in the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood for some time on the pavement, wondering
whether, after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not an ass not to have discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pistol.
And then again he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) decided that to talk to anyone whomsoever about
the Bellegardes would be extremely disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). The least
disagreeable thing, under the circumstances, was to banish them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
mind, and never think of them again. Indecision had not hitherto
been one of Newman's weaknesses, and in this case it was not of long
duration. For three days after this he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not, or at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tried not
to, think of the Bellegardes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dined with Mrs. Tristram, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
mentioning their name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) almost severely to desist. This
gave Tom Tristram a much-coveted opportunity to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) condolences.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) leaned forward, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand on Newman's arm compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lips
and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``The fact is my dear fellow, you see, that you
ought never to have gone into it. It was not your doing, I know--it was
all my wife. If you want to come down on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), I'll stand off; I give you
leave to hit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as hard as you like. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has never had a word
of reproach from me in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is in need of something
of the kind. Why didn't you listen to _me?_ You know I didn't believe in
the thing. I thought it at the best an amiable delusion. I don't profess
to be a Don Juan or a gay Lothario,--that class of man, you know; but I
do pretend to know something about the harder sex. I have never disliked
a woman in my life that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not turned out badly. I was not at all
deceived in Lizzie, for instance; I always had my doubts about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>).
Whatever you may think of my present situation, I must at least admit
that I got into it with my eyes open. Now suppose you had got into
something like this box with Madame de Cintré. You may depend upon it
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzie</b></font>) would have turned out a stiff one. And upon my word I don't see
where you could have found your comfort. Not from the marquis, my dear
Newman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wasn't a man you could go and talk things over with in a
sociable, common-sense way. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ever seem to want to have you on the
premises--did he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ever try to see you alone? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ever ask you to come
and smoke a cigar with him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of an evening, or step in, when you had been
calling on the ladies, and take something? I don't think you would have
got much encouragement out of _him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)_. And as for the old lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) struck
one as an uncommonly strong dose. They have a great expression here, you
know; they call it `sympathetic.' Everything is sympathetic--or ought
to be. Now Madame de Bellegarde is about as sympathetic as that
mustard-pot. They're a d--d cold-blooded lot, any way; I felt it awfully
at that ball of theirs. I felt as if I were walking up and down in the
Armory, in the Tower of London! My dear boy, don't think me a vulgar
brute for hinting at it, but you may depend upon it, all they wanted
was your money. I know something about that; I can tell when people
want one's money! Why they stopped wanting yours I don't know; I suppose
because they could get someone else's without working so hard for it. It
isn't worth finding out. It may be that it was not Madame de Cintré that
backed out first, very likely the old woman put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up to it. I suspect
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother are really as thick as thieves, eh? You are well out
of it, my boy; make up your mind to that. If I express myself strongly
it is all because I love you so much; and from that point of view I may
say I should as soon have thought of making up to that piece of pale
high-mightiness as I should have thought of making up to the Obelisk in
the Place de la Concorde.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman sat gazing at Tristram during this harangue with a lack-lustre
eye; never yet had he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seemed to himself to have outgrown so completely
the phase of equal comradeship with Tom Tristram. Mrs. Tristram's glance
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband had more of a spark; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) turned to Newman with a slightly
lurid smile. <div class="bookquote">``You must at least do justice,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to the felicity
with which Mr. Tristram repairs the indiscretions of a too zealous
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But even without the aid of Tom Tristram's conversational felicities,
Newman would have begun to think of the Bellegardes again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could
cease to think of them only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ceased to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) loss and
privation, and the days had as yet but scantily lightened the weight
of this incommodity. In vain Mrs. Tristram begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to cheer up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) countenance made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) miserable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) demanded with a trembling voice. <div class="bookquote">``I feel like
a widower--and a widower who has not even the consolation of going to
stand beside the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) wife--who has not the right to wear so
much mourning as a weed on his (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) hat. I feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) added in a moment <div class="bookquote">``as if
my wife had been murdered and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) assassins were still at large.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram made no immediate rejoinder, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, with
a smile which, in so far as it was a forced one, was less successfully
simulated than such smiles, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lips, usually were; <div class="bookquote">``Are you very
sure that you would have been happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stared a moment, and then shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``That's weak,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said;
<div class="bookquote">``that won't do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram with a more triumphant bravery, <div class="bookquote">``I don't
believe you would have been happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman gave a little laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Say I should have been miserable, then;
it's a misery I should have preferred to any happiness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram began to muse. <div class="bookquote">``I should have been curious to see; it
would have been very strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it from curiosity that you urged me to try and marry her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, growing still more audacious. Newman
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) the one angry look he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been destined ever to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>),
turned away and took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hat. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment, and then
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That sounds very cruel, but it is less so than it sounds.
Curiosity has a share in almost everything I do. I wanted very much to
see, first, whether such a marriage could actually take place; second,
what would happen if it should take place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So you didn't believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, resentfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believed--I believed that it would take place, and that you
would be happy. Otherwise I should have been, among my speculations,
a very heartless creature. _But_,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) continued, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) hand upon
Newman's arm and hazarding a grave smile, <div class="bookquote">``it was the highest flight
ever taken by a tolerably bold imagination!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Shortly after this she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to leave Paris and travel for
three months. Change of scene would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
misfortune sooner in absence from the objects which had witnessed it. <div class="bookquote">``I
really feel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``as if to leave _you_, at least, would
do me good--and cost me very little effort. You are growing cynical, you
shock me and pain me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, good-naturedly or cynically, as may be
thought most probable. <div class="bookquote">``I shall certainly see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was very willing to get away from Paris; the brilliant streets he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had walked through in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) happier hours, and which then seemed to wear
a higher brilliancy in honor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) happiness, appeared now to be in
the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) defeat and to look down upon it in shining mockery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
would go somewhere; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) cared little where; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) preparations.
Then, one morning, at haphazard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) drove to the train that would
transport him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to Boulogne and dispatch him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thence to the shores of
Britain. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) rolled along in the train he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked himself what had
become of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) revenge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was able to say that it was provisionally
pigeon-holed in a very safe place; it would keep till called for.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arrived in London in the midst of what is called <div class="bookquote">``the season,''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>and
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might here put himself in the way
of being diverted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heavy-heartedness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew no one in all
England, but the spectacle of the mighty metropolis roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) somewhat
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) apathy. Anything that was enormous usually found favor with
Newman, and the multitudinous energies and industries of England stirred
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a dull vivacity of contemplation. It is on record that the
weather, at that moment, was of the finest English quality; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took
long walks and explored London in every direction; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat by the hour in
Kensington Gardens and beside the adjoining Drive, watching the people
and the horses and the carriages; the rosy English beauties, the
wonderful English dandies, and the splendid flunkies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to the
opera and found it better than in Paris; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went to the theatre and
found a surprising charm in listening to dialogue the finest points
of which came within the range of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) comprehension. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) made several
excursions into the country, recommended by the waiter at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hotel,
with whom, on this and similar points, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had established confidential
relations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) watched the deer in Windsor Forest and admired the Thames
from Richmond Hill; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ate white-bait and brown-bread and butter
at Greenwich, and strolled in the grassy shadow of the cathedral of
Canterbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) also visited the Tower of London and Madame Tussaud's
exhibition. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would go to Sheffield, and then,
thinking again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave it up. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) go to Sheffield? He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
a feeling that the link which bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to a possible interest in the
manufacture of cutlery was broken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no desire for an <div class="bookquote">``inside view''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>of any successful enterprise whatever, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would not have given the
smallest sum for the privilege of talking over the details of the most
<div class="bookquote">``splendid''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>business with the shrewdest of overseers.

<p/>One afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had walked into Hyde Park, and was slowly threading
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way through the human maze which edges the Drive. The stream of
carriages was no less dense, and Newman, as usual, marveled at the
strange, dingy figures which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw taking the air in some of the
stateliest vehicles. They reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had read of eastern
and southern countries, in which grotesque idols and fetiches were
sometimes taken out of their temples and carried abroad in golden
chariots to be displayed to the multitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw a great many pretty
cheeks beneath high-plumed hats as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) squeezed his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way through serried
waves of crumpled muslin; and sitting on little chairs at the base of
the great serious English trees, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) observed a number of quiet-eyed
maidens who seemed only to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) afresh that the magic of beauty
had gone out of the world with Madame de Cintré: to say nothing of other
damsels, whose eyes were not quiet, and who struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) still more as a
satire on possible consolation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been walking for some time, when,
directly in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), borne back by the summer breeze, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard a
few words uttered in that bright Parisian idiom from which his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) ears had
begun to alienate themselves. The voice in which the words were spoken
made them seem even more like a thing with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had once been
familiar, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes it lent an identity to the commonplace
elegance of the back hair and shoulders of a young lady walking in the
same direction as himself. Mademoiselle Nioche, apparently, had come to
seek a more rapid advancement in London, and another glance led Newman
to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had found it. A gentleman was strolling beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),
lending a most attentive ear to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conversation and too entranced to
open his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips. Newman did not hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) voice, but perceived that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presented the dorsal expression of a well-dressed Englishman.
Mademoiselle Nioche was attracting attention: the ladies who passed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
turned round to survey the Parisian perfection of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toilet. A great
cataract of flounces rolled down from the young lady's waist to Newman's
feet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had to step aside to avoid treading upon them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stepped
aside, indeed, with a decision of movement which the occasion scarcely
demanded; for even this imperfect glimpse of Miss Noémie had excited
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) displeasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) seemed an odious blot upon the face of nature;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wanted to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Noémie</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought of Valentin de
Bellegarde, still green in the earth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) burial--his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) young life
clipped by this flourishing impudence. The perfume of the young lady's
finery sickened him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head and tried to deflect his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) course;
but the pressure of the crowd kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a few minutes longer, so
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was saying.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will miss me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) murmured. <div class="bookquote">``It was very cruel in me
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); I am afraid you will think me a very heartless creature.
He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might perfectly well have come with us. I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) is very
well,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``it seemed to me to-day that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was not very gay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman wondered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was talking about, but just then an opening
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neighbors enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to turn away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said to himself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was probably paying a tribute to British propriety and playing
at tender solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) papa. Was that miserable old man still
treading the path of vice in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) train? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still giving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the
benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) experience of affairs, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed the sea to
serve as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) interpreter? Newman walked some distance farther, and then
began to retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) steps taking care not to traverse again the orbit
of Mademoiselle Nioche. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked for a chair under the trees,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had some difficulty in finding an empty one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was about to give
up the search when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw a gentleman rise from the seat he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been
occupying, leaving Newman to take it without looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neighbors.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat there for some time without heeding them; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attention was lost
in the irritation and bitterness produced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) recent glimpse of Miss
Noémie's iniquitous vitality. But at the end of a quarter of an hour,
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) perceived a small pug-dog squatted upon the path
near his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) feet--a diminutive but very perfect specimen of its interesting
species. The pug was sniffing at the fashionable world, as it passed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) little black muzzle, and was kept from extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
investigation by a large blue ribbon attached to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) collar with an
enormous rosette and held in the hand of a person seated next to
Newman. To this person Newman transferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attention, and immediately
perceived that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was the object of all that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neighbor, who was
staring up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) from a pair of little fixed white eyes. These eyes
Newman instantly recognized; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been sitting for the last quarter of
an hour beside M. Nioche. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had vaguely felt that someone was staring
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). M. Nioche continued to stare; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) appeared afraid to move, even
to the extent of evading Newman's glance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman; <div class="bookquote">``are you here, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
neighbor's helplessness more grimly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) knew. M. Nioche had a new
hat and a pair of kid gloves; his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) clothes, too, seemed to belong to a
more recent antiquity than of yore. Over his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) arm was suspended a lady's
mantilla--a light and brilliant tissue, fringed with white lace--which
had apparently been committed to his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) keeping; and the little dog's blue
ribbon was wound tightly round his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) hand. There was no expression of
recognition in his (<font color='blue'><b>kid</b></font>) face--or of anything indeed save a sort of feeble,
fascinated dread; Newman looked at the pug and the lace mantilla, and
then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) met the old man's eyes again. <div class="bookquote">``You know me, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pursued.
<div class="bookquote">``You might have spoken to me before.''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>M. Nioche still said nothing,
but it seemed to Newman that his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes began faintly to water. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't
expect,''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>our hero went on, <div class="bookquote">``to meet you so far from--from the Café de la
Patrie.''  (<font color='red'><b>hero</b></font>)</div>The old man remained silent, but decidedly Newman had touched
the source of tears. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) neighbor sat staring and Newman added, <div class="bookquote">``What's
the matter, M. Nioche? You used to talk--to talk very prettily. Don't
you remember you even gave lessons in conversation?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>At this M. Nioche decided to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) attitude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stooped and picked
up the pug, lifted it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes on its little soft
back. <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid to speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) presently said, looking over the
puppy's shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I hoped you wouldn't notice me. I should have moved
away, but I was afraid that if I moved you would notice me. So I sat
very still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect you have a bad conscience, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>The old man put down the little dog and held it carefully in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) lap.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) eyes still fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) interlocutor.
<div class="bookquote">``No, Mr. Newman, I have a good conscience,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) murmured.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why should you want to slink away from me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because--because you don't understand my position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I think you once explained it to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``But it seems
improved.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Improved!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>exclaimed M. Nioche, under his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) breath. <div class="bookquote">``Do you call this
improvement?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) glanced at the treasures in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you are on your travels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman rejoined. <div class="bookquote">``A visit to London in
the season is certainly a sign of prosperity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche, in answer to this cruel piece of irony, lifted the puppy up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face again, peering at Newman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) small blank eye-holes.
There was something almost imbecile in the movement, and Newman hardly
knew whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was taking refuge in a convenient affectation of
unreason, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had in fact paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) dishonor by the loss of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wits. In the latter case, just now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt little more tenderly
to the foolish old man than in the former. Responsible or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
equally an accomplice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detestably mischievous daughter. Newman
was going to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) abruptly, when a ray of entreaty appeared to
disengage itself from the old man's misty gaze. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going away?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you want me to stay?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have left you--from consideration. But my dignity suffers at
your leaving me--that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got anything particular to say to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to see that no one was listening, and then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said, very softly but distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``I have _not_ forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman gave a short laugh, but the old man seemed for the moment not to
perceive it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was gazing away, absently, at some metaphysical image
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) implacability. <div class="bookquote">``It doesn't much matter whether you forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) or
not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman. <div class="bookquote">``There are other people who won't, I assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>M. Nioche softly questioned, turning round again.
<div class="bookquote">``I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has done a devilish mischief; it doesn't matter what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s a nuisance; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) ought to be stopped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>M. Nioche stealthily put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand and laid it very gently upon
Newman's arm. <div class="bookquote">``Stopped, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``That's it. Stopped short.
She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is running away--she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) must be stopped.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) paused a moment and
looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I mean to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``I am only waiting
for my chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, laughing briefly again. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is running away and
you are running after her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). You have run a long distance!''

 (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div><p/>But M. Nioche stared insistently: <div class="bookquote">``I shall stop her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) softly
repeated.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had hardly spoken when the crowd in front of them separated, as if by
the impulse to make way for an important personage. Presently, through
the opening, advanced Mademoiselle Nioche, attended by the gentleman
whom Newman had lately observed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) face being now presented to our
hero, the latter recognized the irregular features, the hardly more
regular complexion, and the amiable expression of Lord Deepmere. Noémie,
on finding herself suddenly confronted with Newman, who, like M. Nioche,
had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) seat, faltered for a barely perceptible instant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>)
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a little nod, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) yesterday, and then, with
a good-natured smile, <div class="bookquote">``_Tiens_, how we keep meeting!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>)
looked consummately pretty, and the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) dress was a wonderful
work of art. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) father, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) hands for the
little dog, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) submissively placed in them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) began to
kiss it and murmur over it: <div class="bookquote">``To think of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all alone,--what
a wicked, abominable creature he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must believe me! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been very
unwell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) added, turning and affecting to explain to Newman, with a
spark of infernal impudence, fine as a needlepoint, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) eye. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
think the English climate agrees with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to agree wonderfully well with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean me? I have never been better, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Noémie
declared. <div class="bookquote">``But with _milord_'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) gave a brilliant glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>)
late companion--<div class="bookquote">``how can one help being well?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) seated herself in the
chair from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Nioche</b></font>) father had risen, and began to arrange the little
dog's rosette.

<p/>Lord Deepmere carried off such embarrassment as might be incidental
to this unexpected encounter with the inferior grace of a male and
a Briton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) blushed a good deal, and greeted the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Briton</b></font>) late
momentary aspiration to rivalry in the favor of a person other than
the mistress of the invalid pug with an awkward nod and a rapid
ejaculation--an ejaculation to which Newman, who often found it hard to
understand the speech of English people, was able to attach no meaning.
Then the young man stood there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hip, and with a
conscious grin, staring askance at Miss Noémie. Suddenly an idea seemed
to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, turning to Newman, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, you know her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>). I don't believe you do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes, I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div>said Lord Deepmere, with another grin. <div class="bookquote">``I knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in Paris--by my poor cousin Bellegarde, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), poor
fellow, didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)? It was she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), you know, who was at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>)
affair. Awfully sad, wasn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>continued the young man, talking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) embarrassment as his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simple nature permitted. <div class="bookquote">``They got up some
story about its being for the Pope; about the other man having said
something against the Pope's morals. They always do that, you know. They
put it on the Pope because Bellegarde was once in the Zouaves. But it
was about _her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)_ morals--_she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)_ was the Pope!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Deepmere</b></font>)</div>Lord Deepmere pursued,
directing an eye illumined by this pleasantry toward Mademoiselle
Nioche, who was bending gracefully over her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lap-dog, apparently absorbed
in conversation with it. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you think it rather odd that I
should--ah--keep up the acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man resumed; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
couldn't help it, you know, and Bellegarde was only my twentieth cousin.
I dare say you think it's rather cheeky, my showing with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in Hyde
Park, but you see she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) isn't known yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s in such very good
form--''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>And Lord Deepmere's conclusion was lost in the attesting
glance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Deepmere</b></font>) again directed toward the young lady.

<p/>Newman turned away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was having more of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) relished. M.
Nioche had stepped aside on his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter's approach, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stood there,
within a very small compass, looking down hard at the ground. It had
never yet, as between him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) and Newman, been so apposite to place on
record the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had not forgiven his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) daughter. As Newman was
moving away he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) looked up and drew near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), and Newman, seeing the
old man had something particular to say, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head for an instant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will see it some day in the papers,''  (<font color='red'><b>M. Nioche</b></font>)</div>murmured M. Nioche.

<p/>Our hero departed to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) smile, and to this day, though the
newspapers form his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) principal reading, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) eyes have not been arrested
by any paragraph forming a sequel to this announcement.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVI

<p/>In that uninitiated observation of the great spectacle of English life
upon which I have touched, it might be supposed that Newman passed a
great many dull days. But the dullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) days pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
melancholy, which was settling into a secondary stage, like a healing
wound, had in it a certain acrid, palatable sweetness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had company in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts, and for the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wanted no other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no desire
to make acquaintances, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) left untouched a couple of notes of
introduction which had been sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) by Tom Tristram. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) thought a great
deal of Madame de Cintré--sometimes with a dogged tranquillity which
might have seemed, for a quarter of an hour at a time, a near neighbor
to forgetfulness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) lived over again the happiest hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had
known--that silver chain of numbered days in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) afternoon visits,
tending sensibly to the ideal result, had subtilized his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) good humor to
a sort of spiritual intoxication. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) came back to reality, after such
reveries, with a somewhat muffled shock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had begun to feel the need
of accepting the unchangeable. At other times the reality became an
infamy again and the unchangeable an imposture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gave himself up
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) angry restlessness till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was weary. But on the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) fell
into a rather reflective mood. Without in the least intending it or
knowing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) attempted to read the moral of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) strange misadventure.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked himself, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) quieter hours, whether perhaps, after all,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) _was_ more commercial than was pleasant. We know that it was in
obedience to a strong reaction against questions exclusively commercial
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) had come out to pick up æsthetic entertainment in Europe; it may
therefore be understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) was able to conceive that a man might be
too commercial. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very willing to grant it, but the concession, as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own case, was not made with any very oppressive sense of shame.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been too commercial, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to forget it, for in being
so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done no man any wrong that might not be as easily forgotten.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflected with sober placidity that at least there were no monuments
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``meanness''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>scattered about the world. If there was any reason in
the nature of things why his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) connection with business should have cast a
shadow upon a connection--even a connection broken--with a woman justly
proud, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was willing to sponge it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life forever. The thing
seemed a possibility; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not feel it, doubtless, as keenly as some
people, and it hardly seemed worth while to flap his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wings very hard to
rise to the idea; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could feel it enough to make any sacrifice that
still remained to be made. As to what such sacrifice was now to be
made to, here Newman stopped short before a blank wall over which there
sometimes played a shadowy imagery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had a fancy of carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
life as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have directed it if Madame de Cintré had been left to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Cintré</b></font>)--of making it a religion to do nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have disliked.
In this, certainly, there was no sacrifice; but there was a pale,
oblique ray of inspiration. It would be lonely entertainment--a good
deal like a man talking to himself in the mirror for want of better
company. Yet the idea yielded Newman several half hours' dumb exaltation
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) legs stretched,
over the relics of an expensively poor dinner, in the undying English
twilight. If, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) commercial imagination was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt no
contempt for the surviving actualities begotten by it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had been prosperous and had been a great man of business rather than a
small one; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was extremely glad he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rich. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt no impulse to sell
all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had and give to the poor, or to retire into meditative economy
and asceticism. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rich and tolerably young; if it was
possible to think too much about buying and selling, it was a gain to
have a good slice of life left in which not to think about them. Come,
what should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) think about now? Again and again Newman could think only
of one thing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thoughts always came back to it, and as they did so,
with an emotional rush which seemed physically to express itself in a
sudden upward choking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned forward--the waiter having left the
room--and, resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms on the table, buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) troubled face.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remained in England till midsummer, and spent a month in the country,
wandering about cathedrals, castles, and ruins. Several times, taking
a walk from his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) inn into meadows and parks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stopped by a well-worn
stile, looked across through the early evening at a gray church tower,
with its dusky nimbus of thick-circling swallows, and remembered that
this might have been part of the entertainment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) honeymoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
never been so much alone or indulged so little in accidental dialogue.
The period of recreation appointed by Mrs. Tristram had at last expired,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) asked himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should do now. Mrs. Tristram had written
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), proposing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) should join her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) in the Pyrenees; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was not in the humor to return to France. The simplest thing was to
repair to Liverpool and embark on the first American steamer. Newman
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) way to the great seaport and secured his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) berth; and the night
before sailing he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) room at the hotel, staring down, vacantly
and wearily, at an open portmanteau. A number of papers were lying
upon it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had been meaning to look over; some of them might
conveniently be destroyed. But at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) shuffled them roughly
together, and pushed them into a corner of the valise; they were
business papers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was in no humor for sifting them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) drew
forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book and took out a paper of smaller size than those he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
had dismissed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not unfold it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) simply sat looking at the back
of it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had momentarily entertained the idea of destroying it, the
idea quickly expired. What the paper suggested was the feeling that
lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) innermost heart and that no reviving cheerfulness could long
quench--the feeling that after all and above all he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was a good fellow
wronged. With it came a hearty hope that the Bellegardes were enjoying
their suspense as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would do yet. The more it was prolonged the
more they would enjoy it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had hung fire once, yes; perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
present queer state of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might hang fire again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) restored
the little paper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book very tenderly, and felt better for
thinking of the suspense of the Bellegardes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt better every time
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought of it after that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sailed the summer seas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) landed
in New York and journeyed across the continent to San Francisco, and
nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) observed by the way contributed to mitigate his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) sense of
being a good fellow wronged.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) saw a great many other good fellows--his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) old friends--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) told
none of them of the trick that had been played him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said simply that
the lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was to have married had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
was asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we change the
subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) friends that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had brought home no <div class="bookquote">``new ideas''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from Europe, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) conduct probably struck them as an eloquent proof
of failing invention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) took no interest in chatting about his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) affairs
and manifested no desire to look over his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) accounts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) asked half a
dozen questions which, like those of an eminent physician inquiring
for particular symptoms, showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) still knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was talking
about; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) made no comments and gave no directions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) not only
puzzled the gentlemen on the stock exchange, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) was himself
surprised at the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) indifference. As it seemed only to
increase, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) made an effort to combat it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) tried to interest himself
and to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) old occupations. But they appeared unreal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>); do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) somehow could not believe in them. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) began
to fear that there was something the matter with his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) head; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
brain, perhaps, had softened, and that the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) strong activities
had come. This idea came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) with an exasperating force.
A hopeless, helpless loafer, useful to no one and detestable to
himself--this was what the treachery of the Bellegardes had made of him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>).
In his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) restless idleness he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) came back from San Francisco to New York,
and sat for three days in the lobby of his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) hotel, looking out through
a huge wall of plate-glass at the unceasing stream of pretty girls in
Parisian-looking dresses, undulating past with little parcels nursed
against their neat figures. At the end of three days he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) returned to San
Francisco, and having arrived there he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had stayed away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
had nothing to do, his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) occupation was gone, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) should never find it again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had nothing to do _here_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) sometimes
said to himself; but there was something beyond the ocean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
was still to do; something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) had left undone experimentally and
speculatively, to see if it could content itself to remain undone. But
it was not content: it kept pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) heartstrings and thumping at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) reason; it murmured in his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) ears and hovered perpetually before his (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
eyes. It interposed between all new resolutions and their fulfillment;
it seemed like a stubborn ghost, dumbly entreating to be laid. Till that
was done he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>) should never be able to do anything else.

<p/>One day, toward the end of the winter, after a long interval, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francisco</b></font>)
received a letter from Mrs. Tristram, who apparently was animated by a
charitable desire to amuse and distract her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) correspondent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) much Paris gossip, talked of General Packard and Miss Kitty Upjohn,
enumerated the new plays at the theatre, and enclosed a note from her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>)
husband, who had gone down to spend a month at Nice. Then came her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>)
signature, and after this her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) postscript. The latter consisted of these
few lines: <div class="bookquote">``I heard three days since from my friend, the Abbé Aubert,
that Madame de Cintré last week took the veil at the Carmelites. It was
on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) twenty-seventh birthday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) took the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), patroness,
St. Veronica. Sister Veronica has a lifetime before her (<font color='blue'><b>Veronica</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>This letter came to Newman in the morning; in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) started for
Paris. His (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wound began to ache with its first fierceness, and during his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
long bleak journey the thought of Madame de Cintré's <div class="bookquote">``life-time,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame</b></font>)</div>passed within prison walls on whose outer side he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) might stand, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
perpetual company. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would fix himself in Paris forever; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would
extort a sort of happiness from the knowledge that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) was not
there, at least the stony sepulchre that held her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) descended,
unannounced, upon Mrs. Bread, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) found keeping lonely watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
great empty saloons on the Boulevard Haussmann. They were as neat as a
Dutch village, Mrs. Bread's only occupation had been removing individual
dust-particles. She (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) made no complaint, however, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) loneliness, for
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Upjohn</b></font>) philosophy a servant was but a mysteriously projected machine,
and it would be as fantastic for a housekeeper to comment upon a
gentleman's absences as for a clock to remark upon not being wound up.
No particular clock, Mrs. Bread supposed, went all the time, and no
particular servant could enjoy all the sunshine diffused by the career
of an exacting master. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) ventured, nevertheless, to express a modest
hope that Newman meant to remain a while in Paris. Newman laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) hand
on hers and shook it gently. <div class="bookquote">``I mean to remain forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went after this to see Mrs. Tristram, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had telegraphed, and
who expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``This
won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you have come back too soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat down and
asked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) husband and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) children, tried even to inquire about
Miss Dora Finch. In the midst of this--<div class="bookquote">``Do you know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Veronica</b></font>) is?''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
asked, abruptly.

<p/>Mrs. Tristram hesitated a moment; of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) couldn't mean Miss Dora
Finch. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) answered, properly: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Veronica</b></font>) has gone to the other house--in
the Rue d’Enfer.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After Newman had sat a while longer looking very
sombre, she (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``You are not so good a man as I thought. You are
more--you are more--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``More unforgiving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>cried Newman; <div class="bookquote">``do you expect me to forgive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not that. I have forgiven, so of course you can't. But you might
forget! You have a worse temper about it than I should have expected.
You look wicked--you look dangerous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I may be dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but I am not wicked. No, I am not
wicked.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up to go. Mrs. Tristram asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to come back to
dinner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) did not feel like pledging himself to
be present at an entertainment, even as a solitary guest. Later in the
evening, if he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) should be able, he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) would come.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) walked away through the city, beside the Seine and over it, and took
the direction of the Rue d’Enfer. The day had the softness of early
spring; but the weather was gray and humid. Newman found himself in a
part of Paris which he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) little knew--a region of convents and prisons, of
streets bordered by long dead walls and traversed by a few wayfarers.
At the intersection of two of these streets stood the house of the
Carmelites--a dull, plain edifice, with a high-shouldered blank wall
all round it. From without Newman could see its upper windows, its steep
roof and its chimneys. But these things revealed no symptoms of human
life; the place looked dumb, deaf, inanimate. The pale, dead, discolored
wall stretched beneath it, far down the empty side street--a vista
without a human figure. Newman stood there a long time; there were
no passers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was free to gaze his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) fill. This seemed the goal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
journey; it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had come for. It was a strange satisfaction, and
yet it was a satisfaction; the barren stillness of the place seemed to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) own release from ineffectual longing. It told him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) that the woman
within was lost beyond recall, and that the days and years of the future
would pile themselves above her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) like the huge immovable slab of a tomb.
These days and years, in this place, would always be just so gray and
silent. Suddenly, from the thought of their seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) stand there,
again the charm utterly departed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would never stand there again; it
was gratuitous dreariness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) turned away with a heavy heart, but with
a heart lighter than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had brought. Everything was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
too at last could rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) walked down through narrow, winding streets
to the edge of the Seine again, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) saw, close above him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>), the
soft, vast towers of Notre Dame. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) crossed one of the bridges and stood
a moment in the empty place before the great cathedral; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) went
in beneath the grossly-imaged portals. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) wandered some distance up the
nave and sat down in the splendid dimness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) sat a long time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) heard
far-away bells chiming off, at long intervals, to the rest of the world.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was very tired; this was the best place he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could be in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said no
prayers; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had no prayers to say. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had nothing to be thankful for,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had nothing to ask; nothing to ask, because now he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) must take care
of himself. But a great cathedral offers a very various hospitality, and
Newman sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place, because while he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was out of the
world. The most unpleasant thing that had ever happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had
reached its formal conclusion, as it were; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) could close the book and
put it away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) head for a long time on the chair in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); when he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took it up he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was himself again. Somewhere
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) mind, a tight knot seemed to have loosened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) thought of the
Bellegardes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had almost forgotten them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remembered them as people
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had meant to do something to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) gave a groan as he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) remembered what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had meant to do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was annoyed at having meant to do it; the bottom,
suddenly, had fallen out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) revenge. Whether it was Christian
charity or unregenerate good nature--what it was, in the background of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) soul--I don't pretend to say; but Newman's last thought was that of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would let the Bellegardes go.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had spoken it aloud he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) would have said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) didn't want to hurt
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) was ashamed of having wanted to hurt them. They had hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>),
but such things were really not his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) game. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) got up and came out
of the darkening church; not with the elastic step of a man who had won
a victory or taken a resolve, but strolling soberly, like a good-natured
man who is still a little ashamed.

<p/>Going home, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to Mrs. Bread that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to put back
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) things into the portmanteau she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had unpacked the evening before. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
gentle stewardess looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through eyes a trifle bedimmed. <div class="bookquote">``Dear
me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I thought you said that you were going to stay
forever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant that I was going to stay away forever,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman kindly. And
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) departure from Paris on the following day he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) has certainly not
returned. The gilded apartments I have so often spoken of stand ready to
receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>); but they serve only as a spacious residence for Mrs. Bread,
who wanders eternally from room to room, adjusting the tassels of the
curtains, and keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) wages, which are regularly brought her (<font color='blue'><b>stewardess</b></font>) by
a banker's clerk, in a great pink Sèvres vase on the drawing-room
mantelshelf.

<p/>Late in the evening Newman went to Mrs. Tristram's and found Tom
Tristram by the domestic fireside. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to see you back in Paris,''
 (<font color='red'><b>this gentleman</b></font>)</div>this gentleman declared. <div class="bookquote">``You know it's really the only place for a
white man to live.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mr. Tristram made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) friend welcome, according
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) own rosy light, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) a convenient _résumé_ of the
Franco-American gossip of the last six months. Then at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) got up
and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) would go for half an hour to the club. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose a man
who has been for six months in California wants a little intellectual
conversation. I'll let my wife have a go at you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman shook hands heartily with his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) host, but did not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) to
remain; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) place on the sofa, opposite to
Mrs. Tristram. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) presently asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) had done after leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Nothing particular,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You struck me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) rejoined, <div class="bookquote">``as a man with a plot in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. You
looked as if you were bent on some sinister errand, and after you had
left me I wondered whether I ought to have let you go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only went over to the other side of the river--to the Carmelites,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman.

<p/>Mrs. Tristram looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a moment and smiled. <div class="bookquote">``What did you do there?
Try to scale the wall?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did nothing. I looked at the place for a few minutes and then came
away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) a sympathetic glance. <div class="bookquote">``You didn't happen to meet
M. de Bellegarde,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``staring hopelessly at the convent wall as
well? I am told he (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>) sister's conduct very hard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I didn't meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bellegarde</b></font>), I am happy to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman answered, after a
pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are in the country,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Tristram went on; <div class="bookquote">``at--what is the name
of the place?--Fleurières. They returned there at the time you left
Paris and have been spending the year in extreme seclusion. The little
marquise must enjoy it; I expect to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has eloped with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
daughter's music-master!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was looking at the light wood-fire; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) listened to this with
extreme interest. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) spoke: <div class="bookquote">``I mean never to mention the name of
those people again, and I don't want to hear anything more about them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) pocket-book and drew forth a scrap of paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
looked at it an instant, then got up and stood by the fire. <div class="bookquote">``I am going
to burn them up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have you as a witness. There
they go!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) tossed the paper into the flame.

<p/>Mrs. Tristram sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) embroidery needle suspended. <div class="bookquote">``What is that
paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked.

<p/>Newman leaning against the fireplace, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>) arms and drew a
longer breath than usual. Then after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``I can tell you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Newman</b></font>)
said. <div class="bookquote">``It was a paper containing a secret of the Bellegardes--something
which would damn them if it were known.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) embroidery with a reproachful moan. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, why
didn't you show it to me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought of showing it to you--I thought of showing it to everyone. I
thought of paying my debt to the Bellegardes that way. So I told them,
and I frightened them. They have been staying in the country as you tell
me, to keep out of the explosion. But I have given it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram began to take slow stitches again. <div class="bookquote">``Have you quite given
it up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it very bad, this secret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry you have given it up. I
should have liked immensely to see your paper. They have wronged me too,
you know, as your sponsor and guarantee, and it would have served for my
revenge as well. How did you come into possession of your secret?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a long story. But honestly, at any rate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they knew you were master of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I told them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, how interesting!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Tristram. <div class="bookquote">``And you humbled them
at your feet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman was silent a moment. <div class="bookquote">``No, not at all. They pretended not to
care--not to be afraid. But I know they did care--they were afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you very sure?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman stared a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I'm sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Tristram resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) slow stitches. <div class="bookquote">``They defied you, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>said Newman, <div class="bookquote">``it was about that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You tried by the threat of exposure to make them retract?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Tristram pursued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but they wouldn't. I gave them their choice, and they chose to
take their chance of bluffing off the charge and convicting me of fraud.
But they _were_ frightened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div>Newman added, <div class="bookquote">``and I have had all the
vengeance I want.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Newman/Christopher Newman/Christopher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is most provoking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tristram, <div class="bookquote">``to hear you talk of the
`charge' when the charge is burnt up. Is it quite consumed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Tristram/Tristram</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) asked,
glancing at the fire.

<p/>Newman assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>) that there was nothing left of it. <div class="bookquote">``Well then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tristram</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose there is no harm in saying that you probably did not
make them so very uncomfortable. My impression would be that since, as
you say, they defied you, it was because they believed that, after
all, you would never really come to the point. Their confidence, after
counsel taken of each other, was not in their innocence, nor in their
talent for bluffing things off; it was in your remarkable good nature!
You see they were right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Newman instinctively turned to see if the little paper was in fact
consumed; but there was nothing left of it.
