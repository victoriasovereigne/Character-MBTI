<p/>PRELUDE


<p/>Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious
mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt,
at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with
some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one
morning hand-in-hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) still smaller brother, to go and seek
martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged
Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human
hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met
them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great
resolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa's
passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed
romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from
within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which
would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with
the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) epos in
the reform of a religious order.

<p/>That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not
the last of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for
themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of
far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of
a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of
opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and
sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance
they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but
after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and
formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent
social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge
for the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague
ideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was
disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.

<p/>Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient
indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures
of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as
the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might
be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness
remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one
would imagine from the sameness of women's coiffure and the favorite
love-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared
uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the
living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and
there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving
heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are
dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some
long-recognizable deed.





<p/>BOOK I.

<p/>MISS BROOKE.



<p/>CHAPTER I.

<p/>``Since I can do no good because a woman,
Reach constantly at something that is near it.
--The Maid's Tragedy: BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.


<p/>Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into
relief by poor dress. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hand and wrist were so finely formed that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the
Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) profile as well as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) plain
garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) the
impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,--or from one of our
elder poets,--in a paragraph of to-day's newspaper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was usually
spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely
more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) dress
differed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister's, and had a shade of coquetry in its
arrangements; for Miss Brooke's plain dressing was due to mixed
conditions, in most of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) sister shared. The pride of being
ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not
exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably <div class="bookquote">``good:''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div>if you inquired
backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring
or parcel-tying forefathers--anything lower than an admiral or a
clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and
managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a
quiet country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than
a parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster's
daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made
show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was
required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would
have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious
feeling; but in Miss Brooke's case, religion alone would have
determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister's
sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to
accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea
knew many passages of Pascal's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,
made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for
Bedlam. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life
involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and
artificial protrusions of drapery. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was theoretic, and yearned
by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might
frankly include the parish of Tipton and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own rule of conduct there;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
whatever seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,
to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a
quarter where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the
character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lot, and
hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,
vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), the elder of
the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since
they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans
at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and
afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and
guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their
orphaned condition.

<p/>It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with
their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous
opinions, and uncertain vote. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) had travelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) younger years,
and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too
rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to
predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would act with
benevolent intentions, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would spend as little money as
possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite
minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax
about all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own interests except the retention of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snuff-box,
concerning which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.

<p/>In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in
abeyance; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and
virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's talk or his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
way of <div class="bookquote">``letting things be''  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) estate, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) long all the
more for the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would be of age and have some command of
money for generous schemes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was regarded as an heiress; for not
only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but
if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke's
estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year--a rental which
seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel's late
conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and
of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities
of genteel life.

<p/>And how should Dorothea not marry?--a girl so handsome and with such
prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) love of extremes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a
wary man to hesitate before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) an offer, or even might lead
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and
fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick
laborer and prayed fervidly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought herself living in the
time of the Apostles--who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,
and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife
might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the
application of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) income which would interfere with political economy
and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice
before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to
have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic
life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their
neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know
and avoid them.

<p/>The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,
was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and
innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke's large eyes seemed, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much
subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of
blazonry or clock-face for it.

<p/>Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) by
this alarming hearsay, found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had a charm unaccountably
reconcilable with it. Most men thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bewitching when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was on
horseback. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the
country, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to
renouncing it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it
was pretty to see how her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) imagination adorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister Celia with
attractions altogether superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own, and if any gentleman
appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of
seeing Mr. Brooke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) must be in love with Celia:
Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) constantly considered from
Celia's point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for
Celia to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>). That he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) should be regarded as a suitor to herself
would have seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas
about marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have accepted the
judicious Hooker, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been born in time to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) from that
wretched mistake he (<font color='blue'><b>Hooker</b></font>) made in matrimony; or John Milton when his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>)
blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits
it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome
baronet, who said <div class="bookquote">``Exactly''  (<font color='red'><b>an baronet</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) remarks even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) expressed
uncertainty,--how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as a lover? The really
delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of
father, and could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.

<p/>These peculiarities of Dorothea's character caused Mr. Brooke to be all
the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some
middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) nieces. But he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) himself
dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for
such a position, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea's
objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world--that
is to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector's wife, and the small group of
gentry with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So
Miss Brooke presided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) uncle's household, and did not at all
dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.

<p/>Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another
gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt
some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,
noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many
years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also
as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) piety, and having views
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) book. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be
measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.

<p/>Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had set going in the village, and was taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual place in the
pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on
finishing a plan for some buildings -LRB-a kind of work which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) delighted
in-RRB-, when Celia, who had been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) with a hesitating desire to
propose something, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, dear, if you don't mind--if you are not very busy--suppose
we looked at mamma's jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly
six months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked
at them yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia's face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full
presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and
principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious
electricity if you touched them incautiously. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) relief,
Dorothea's eyes were full of laughter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or
six lunar months?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April
when uncle gave them to you. You know, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had forgotten
them till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you
locked them up in the cabinet here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea spoke in a
full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
pencil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.

<p/>Celia colored, and looked very grave. <div class="bookquote">``I think, dear, we are wanting
in respect to mamma's memory, to put them by and take no notice of
them. And,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of
mortification, <div class="bookquote">``necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who
was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.
And Christians generally--surely there are women in heaven now who wore
jewels.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) really
applied herself to argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would like to wear them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished
discovery animating her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole person with a dramatic action which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. <div class="bookquote">``Of
course, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before?
But the keys, the keys!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands against the sides of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
head and seemed to despair of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) memory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long
meditated and prearranged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread
out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great
collection, but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable
beauty, the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple
amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five
brilliants in it. Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and
fastened it round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's neck, where it fitted almost as closely
as a bracelet; but the circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of
Celia's head and neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) could see that it did, in the pier-glass
opposite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this
cross you must wear with your dark dresses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. <div class="bookquote">``O Dodo, you must keep
the cross yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, dear, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, putting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand with careless
deprecation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you--in your black dress, now,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, insistingly. <div class="bookquote">``You _might_ wear that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I
would wear as a trinket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea shuddered slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's cheek. <div class="bookquote">``Souls
have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you might like to keep it for mamma's sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have other things of mamma's--her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sandal-wood box which I am so
fond of--plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need
discuss them no longer. There--take away your property.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority
in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of
an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will
never wear them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to
keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that,
I should feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round
with me, and I should not know how to walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. <div class="bookquote">``It would be a
little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit
you better,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness
of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia
happier in taking it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed
a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a
cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very beautiful these gems are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, under a new current
of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. <div class="bookquote">``It is strange how deeply colors
seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why
gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They
look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful
than any of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is a bracelet to match it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``We did not notice
this at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on
a level with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes. All the while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought was trying to justify
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) delight in the colors by merging them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mystic religious joy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You _would_ like those, Dorothea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, rather falteringly,
beginning to think with wonder that her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister showed some weakness,
and also that emeralds would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own complexion even better than
purple amethysts. <div class="bookquote">``You must keep that ring and bracelet--if nothing
else. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I will keep these--this ring and bracelet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.
Then, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand fall on the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said in another
tone--<div class="bookquote">``Yet what miserable men find such things, and work at them, and
sell them!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) paused again, and Celia thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister was
going to renounce the ornaments, as in consistency she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) ought to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, I will keep these,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``But take
all the rest away, and the casket.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking
at them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought of often having them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eye at
these little fountains of pure color.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you wear them in company?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, who was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) with
real curiosity as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) would do.

<p/>Dorothea glanced quickly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister. Across all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) imaginative
adornment of those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) loved, there darted now and then a keen
discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke
ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said, rather haughtily. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell to what level I
may sink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the
ornaments which she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea
too was unhappy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) plan-drawing, questioning the
purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with
that little explosion.

<p/>Celia's consciousness told her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had not been at all in the
wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) should have asked
that question, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) repeated to herself that Dorothea was
inconsistent: either she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) full share of the
jewels, or, after what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should have renounced them
altogether.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure--at least, I trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>thought Celia, <div class="bookquote">``that the wearing of a
necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I
should be bound by Dorothea's opinions now we are going into society,
though of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea
is not always consistent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus Celia, mutely bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) tapestry, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
sister calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great
architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheek against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
sister's arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>). Since they
could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the
attitude of Celia's mind towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) elder sister. The younger had
always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private
opinions?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Humphry Davy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) easy smiling
way, taking up Sir James Chettam's remark that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) was studying Davy's
Agricultural Chemistry. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Davy</b></font>)
years ago at Cartwright's, and Wordsworth was there too--the poet
Wordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at
Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>)--and I dined
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wordsworth</b></font>) twenty years afterwards at Cartwright's. There's an oddity in
things, now. But Davy was there: he (<font color='blue'><b>Davy</b></font>) was a poet too. Or, as I may say,
Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every
sense, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of
dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the
mass of a magistrate's mind fell too noticeably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wondered how a
man like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
thought, were very dignified; the set of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) iron-gray hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
deep eye-sockets made him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) resemble the portrait of Locke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had the
spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different
as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type
represented by Sir James Chettam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,''  (<font color='red'><b>this baronet</b></font>)</div>said this excellent baronet,
<div class="bookquote">``because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see
if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among
my tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?''

 (<font color='red'><b>this baronet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great mistake, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``going into
electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of
your cow-house. It won't do. I went into science a great deal myself
at one time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you
can let nothing alone. No, no--see that your tenants don't sell their
straw, and that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know.
But your fancy farming will not do--the most expensive sort of whistle
you can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``it is better to spend money in finding out
how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in
keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to
make yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir
James had appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was accustomed to do so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
often thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could urge him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to many good actions when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) brother-in-law.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
speaking, and seemed to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) newly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young ladies don't understand political economy, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. ``I remember when we were all
reading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new
ideas at one time--human perfectibility, now. But some say, history
moves in circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it
myself. The fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far--over
the hedge, in fact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it
would not do. I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I
have always been in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought;
else we shall be landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books,
there is Southey's ``Peninsular War.<div class="bookquote">'' I am reading that of a morning.
You know Southey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke's impetuous
reason, and thinking of the book only. <div class="bookquote">``I have little leisure for such
literature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old
characters lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I
am fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect
reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the
inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something
like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying
mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and
confusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution
about my eyesight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
delivered himself with precision, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been called upon to make
a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) speech,
occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head, was the more
conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke's scrappy
slovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most
interesting man she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,
the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the
Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the
highest purposes of truth--what a work to be in any way present at, to
assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) above her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) annoyance at being twitted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ignorance of
political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an
extinguisher over all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>Sir James presently took an
opportunity of saying. <div class="bookquote">``I should have thought you would enter a little
into the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a
chestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw
you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My
groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention
the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not
ride any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a
little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attention when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, that is too hard,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that
showed strong interest. <div class="bookquote">``Your sister is given to self-mortification,
is she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, feeling afraid lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) should say
something that would not please her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister, and blushing as prettily as
possible above her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) necklace. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) likes giving up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not
self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to
do what is very agreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/>Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.
Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was aware of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``You give up from some high, generous
motive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>answered
Dorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rarely blushed, and only from
high delight or anger. At this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt angry with the perverse
Sir James. Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) not pay attention to Celia, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) to
listen to Mr. Casaubon?--if that learned man would only talk, instead
of allowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then
informing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) that the Reformation either meant something or it did
not, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism
was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist
chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly
speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I made a great study of theology at one time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, as if
to explain the insight just manifested. <div class="bookquote">``I know something of all
schools. I knew Wilberforce in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilberforce</b></font>) best days. Do you know
Wilberforce?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon said, <div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went
into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the
independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, <div class="bookquote">``but I have documents. I
began a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but
when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an
answer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your
documents?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In pigeon-holes partly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air
of effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects
under each letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``You have
an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot let young ladies
meddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had some
special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other
fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)_.

<p/>When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Celia! He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Locke</b></font>) has the same deep
eye-sockets.''

Dorothea, walking away a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a
cochon de lait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dodo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Celia, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``I never heard
you make such a comparison before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good
comparison: the match is perfect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as
if they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul
in a man's face.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia was not without a touch of naive
malice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with the full voice of
decision. <div class="bookquote">``Everything I see in him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) corresponds to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) pamphlet on
Biblical Cosmology.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) talks very little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no one for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to talk to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia thought privately, <div class="bookquote">``Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I
believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia felt that this was a pity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet's interest.
Sometimes, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a
husband happy who had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) way of looking at things; and stifled in
the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) heart was the feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister was too
religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt
needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even eating.

<p/>When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), not having felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mode of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) at all offensive. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), and
manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted
by preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was thoroughly
charming to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), but of course he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) theorized a little about his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
attachment. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare
merit of knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) talents, even if let loose, would not set the
smallest stream in the county on fire: hence he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) liked the prospect of a
wife to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could say, <div class="bookquote">``What shall we do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>about this or that; who
could help her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband out with reasons, and would also have the
property qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness
alleged against Miss Brooke, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a very indefinite notion of what it
consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In
short, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready
to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could
always put down when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked. Sir James had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) should
ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose
cleverness he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) delighted. Why not? A man's mind--what there is of
it--has always the advantage of being masculine,--as the smallest
birch-tree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,--and even
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ignorance is of a sounder quality. Sir James might not have
originated this estimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest
personality with a little gum or starch in the form of tradition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,
Miss Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the admirer</b></font>)</div>said the persevering admirer. <div class="bookquote">``I assure you, riding is
the most healthy of exercises.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, coldly. <div class="bookquote">``I think it would do Celia
good--if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) would take to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are such a perfect horsewoman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily
thrown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a
perfect horsewoman, that she (<font color='blue'><b>horsewoman</b></font>) may accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>horsewoman</b></font>) husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that
I ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never
correspond to your pattern of a lady.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea looked straight before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a
handsome boy, in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
admirer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is
not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was
listening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must not inquire too curiously into motives,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) interposed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
measured way. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in
the utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep
the germinating grain away from the light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the
speaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,
and with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could
illuminate principle with the widest knowledge a man whose learning
almost amounted to a proof of whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed!

<p/>Dorothea's inferences may seem large; but really life could never have
gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,
which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.
Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of
pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said good Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Brooke shall not be urged to
tell reasons she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would rather be silent upon. I am sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) reasons
would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) honor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had
looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that a girl to whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm
towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a
clergyman of some distinction.

<p/>However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with
Mr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to
Celia, and talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister; spoke of a house in town,
and asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) sister,
Celia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the
second Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,
though not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the
elder sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had chosen the one who was in all
respects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to
having the best. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who
pretended not to expect it.



<p/>CHAPTER III.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,
The affable archangel ...
Eve
The story heard attentive, and was filled
With admiration, and deep muse, to hear
Of things so high and strange.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Paradise Lost, B. vii.


<p/>If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a
suitable wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), the reasons that might induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
were already planted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind, and by the evening of the next day
the reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long
conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company
of Mr. Casaubon's moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to
play with the curate's ill-shod but merry children.

<p/>Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of
Mr. Casaubon's mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine
extension every quality she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself brought; had opened much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
experience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and had understood from him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) the scope of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) great
work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been as
instructive as Milton's <div class="bookquote">``affable archangel;''  (<font color='red'><b>John/Milton/John Milton</b></font>)</div>and with something of the
archangelic manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had undertaken to show -LRB-what
indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,
justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.
Casaubon aimed-RRB- that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical
fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally
revealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm
footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became
intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of
correspondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no
light or speedy work. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) notes already made a formidable range of
volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous
still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of
Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to
Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have done
to a fellow-student, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not two styles of talking at command:
it is true that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) used a Greek or Latin phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) always gave the
English with scrupulous care, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would probably have done this in
any case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
acquaintances as of <div class="bookquote">``lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,
that conne Latyn but lytille.''

 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintances</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this
conception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies' school
literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile
complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who
united the glories of doctor and saint.

<p/>The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when
Dorothea was impelled to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind on certain themes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
could speak of to no one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had before seen at Tipton, especially
on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of
belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self
in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to be expressed
in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found in Mr.
Casaubon a listener who understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at once, who could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise
conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) thinks with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea to herself, <div class="bookquote">``or rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) thinks a
whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>)
feelings too, his (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) whole experience--what a lake compared with my little
pool!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly
than other young ladies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) age. Signs are small measurable things,
but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent
nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a
sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of
knowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad
himself may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong
reasoning sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a
long way off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we
now and then arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was
hasty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was
unworthy of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) stayed a little longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had intended, on a slight pressure of
invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own
documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called
into the library to look at these in a heap, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) host picked up
first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and
uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, now, but here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>and finally pushing them all aside to open the
journal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) youthful Continental travels.

<p/>``Look here--here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of
Rhamnus--you are a great Grecian, now. I don't know whether you have
given much study to the topography. I spent no end of time in making
out these things--Helicon, now. Here, now!--``We started the next
morning for Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.<div class="bookquote">'' All this volume is
about Greece, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parnassus</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) thumb
transversely along the edges of the leaves as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) held the book forward.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in
the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as
possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this
desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and
that the man who took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on this severe mental scamper was not only an
amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endurance
aided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?

<p/>Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) seemed more and more bent on making her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), on
drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke
along the gravelled terrace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) felt the
disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship
with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils
of maturity. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) delivered this statement with as much careful
precision as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be
attended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should have to repeat or revise his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) communications of a
practical or personal kind. The inclinations which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had deliberately
stated on the 2d of October he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would think it enough to refer to by the
mention of that date; judging by the standard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own memory, which
was a volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and
not the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten
writing. But in this case Mr. Casaubon's confidence was not likely to
be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said with the
eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in
experience is an epoch.

<p/>It was three o'clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.
Casaubon drove off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from
Tipton; and Dorothea, who had on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bonnet and shawl, hurried along
the shrubbery and across the park that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might wander through the
bordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,
the Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in
their walks. There had risen before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the girl's vision of a
possible future for herself to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked forward with trembling
hope, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted to wander on in that visionary future without
interruption. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) straw bonnet -LRB-which our contemporaries might look
at with conjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket-RRB- fell a
little backward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would perhaps be hardly characterized enough if
it were omitted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) brown hair flatly braided and coiled
behind so as to expose the outline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head in a daring manner at a
time when public feeling required the meagreness of nature to be
dissimulated by tall barricades of frizzed curls and bows, never
surpassed by any great race except the Feejeean. This was a trait of
Miss Brooke's asceticism. But there was nothing of an ascetic's
expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) bright full eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) looked before her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), not
consciously seeing, but absorbing into the intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mood, the
solemn glory of the afternoon with its long swathes of light between
the far-off rows of limes, whose shadows touched each other.

<p/>All people, young or old -LRB-that is, all people in those ante-reform
times-RRB-, would have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) an interesting object if they had
referred the glow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eyes and cheeks to the newly awakened ordinary
images of young love: the illusions of Chloe about Strephon have been
sufficiently consecrated in poetry, as the pathetic loveliness of all
spontaneous trust ought to be. Miss Pippin adoring young Pumpkin, and
dreaming along endless vistas of unwearying companionship, was a little
drama which never tired our fathers and mothers, and had been put into
all costumes. Let but Pumpkin have a figure which would sustain the
disadvantages of the shortwaisted swallow-tail, and everybody felt it
not only natural but necessary to the perfection of womanhood, that a
sweet girl should be at once convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pippin</b></font>) virtue, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pippin</b></font>) exceptional
ability, and above all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pippin</b></font>) perfect sincerity. But perhaps no persons
then living--certainly none in the neighborhood of Tipton--would have
had a sympathetic understanding for the dreams of a girl whose notions
about marriage took their color entirely from an exalted enthusiasm
about the ends of life, an enthusiasm which was lit chiefly by its own
fire, and included neither the niceties of the trousseau, the pattern
of plate, nor even the honors and sweet joys of the blooming matron.

<p/>It had now entered Dorothea's mind that Mr. Casaubon might wish to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wife, and the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would do so touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with a sort
of reverential gratitude. How good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--nay, it would be almost as
if a winged messenger had suddenly stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) path and held out
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hand towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)! For a long while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been oppressed by the
indefiniteness which hung in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind, like a thick summer haze, over
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) desire to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life greatly effective. What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) do,
what ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to do?--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), hardly more than a budding woman, but yet
with an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied
by a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a
discursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
might have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler
clergy, the perusal of <div class="bookquote">``Female Scripture Characters,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergy</b></font>)</div>unfolding the
private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under
the New, and the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) soul over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) embroidery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) own
boudoir--with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if
less strict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously
inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such
contentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) religious
disposition, the coercion it exercised over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life, was but one
aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually
consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow
teaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a
labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no
whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration
and inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) best, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted to
justify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended
admission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as
yet all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was one that would deliver her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) girlish subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
ignorance, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the freedom of voluntary submission to a guide
who would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) along the grandest path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should learn everything then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to herself, still walking
quickly along the bridle road through the wood. <div class="bookquote">``It would be my duty
to study that I might help him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) the better in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) great works. There
would be nothing trivial about our lives. Every-day things with us
would mean the greatest things. It would be like marrying Pascal. I
should learn to see the truth by the same light as great men have seen
it by. And then I should know what to do, when I got older: I should
see how it was possible to lead a grand life here--now--in England. I
don't feel sure about doing good in any way now: everything seems like
going on a mission to a people whose language I don't know;--unless it
were building good cottages--there can be no doubt about that. Oh, I
hope I should be able to get the people well housed in Lowick! I will
draw plenty of plans while I have time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea checked herself suddenly with self-rebuke for the presumptuous
way in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was reckoning on uncertain events, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was spared
any inward effort to change the direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thoughts by the
appearance of a cantering horseman round a turning of the road. The
well-groomed chestnut horse and two beautiful setters could leave no
doubt that the rider was Sir James Chettam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) discerned Dorothea,
jumped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) horse at once, and, having delivered it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) groom,
advanced towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with something white on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) arm, at which the two
setters were barking in an excited manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How delightful to meet you, Miss Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) said, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) hat and
showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) sleekly waving blond hair. <div class="bookquote">``It has hastened the pleasure I
was looking forward to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Brooke was annoyed at the interruption. This amiable baronet,
really a suitable husband for Celia, exaggerated the necessity of
making himself agreeable to the elder sister. Even a prospective
brother-in-law may be an oppression if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) will always be presupposing
too good an understanding with you, and agreeing with you even when you
contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>). The thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) had made the mistake of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)
addresses to herself could not take shape: all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mental activity was
used up in persuasions of another kind. But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) was positively
obtrusive at this moment, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) dimpled hands were quite
disagreeable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) roused temper made her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) color deeply, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) returned
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) greeting with some haughtiness.

<p/>Sir James interpreted the heightened color in the way most gratifying
to himself, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) never saw Miss Brooke looking so handsome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have brought a little petitioner,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or rather, I have
brought him (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) will be approved before his (<font color='blue'><b>petitioner</b></font>) petition is
offered.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) showed the white object under his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) arm, which was a tiny
Maltese puppy, one of nature's most naive toys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is painful to me to see these creatures that are bred merely as
pets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, whose opinion was forming itself that very moment
-LRB-as opinions will-RRB- under the heat of irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, as they walked forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe all the petting that is given them does not make them happy.
They are too helpless: their lives are too frail. A weasel or a mouse
that gets its own living is more interesting. I like to think that the
animals about us have souls something like our own, and either carry on
their own little affairs or can be companions to us, like Monk here.
Those creatures are parasitic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad I know that you do not like them,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said good Sir James.
<div class="bookquote">``I should never keep them for myself, but ladies usually are fond of
these Maltese dogs. Here, John, take this dog, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The objectionable puppy, whose nose and eyes were equally black and
expressive, was thus got rid of, since Miss Brooke decided that it had
better not have been born. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) felt it necessary to explain.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not judge of Celia's feeling from mine. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) likes
these small pets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had a tiny terrier once, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was very fond
of. It made me unhappy, because I was afraid of treading on it. I am
rather short-sighted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have your own opinion about everything, Miss Brooke, and it is
always a good opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What answer was possible to such stupid complimenting?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I envy you that,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>Sir James said, as they continued
walking at the rather brisk pace set by Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your power of forming an opinion. I can form an opinion of persons.
I know when I like people. But about other matters, do you know, I
have often a difficulty in deciding. One hears very sensible things
said on opposite sides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Or that seem sensible. Perhaps we don't always discriminate between
sense and nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was rather rude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``But you seem to have the power of
discrimination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I am often unable to decide. But that is from
ignorance. The right conclusion is there all the same, though I am
unable to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think there are few who would see it more readily. Do you know,
Lovegood was telling me yesterday that you had the best notion in the
world of a plan for cottages--quite wonderful for a young lady, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
thought. You had a real _genus_, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said you
wanted Mr. Brooke to build a new set of cottages, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) seemed to
think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent. Do you know,
that is one of the things I wish to do--I mean, on my own estate. I
should be so glad to carry out that plan of yours, if you would let me
see it. Of course, it is sinking money; that is why people object to
it. Laborers can never pay rent to make it answer. But, after all, it
is worth doing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worth doing! yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, energetically, forgetting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) previous small vexations. <div class="bookquote">``I think we deserve to be beaten out of
our beautiful houses with a scourge of small cords--all of us who let
tenants live in such sties as we see round us. Life in cottages might
be happier than ours, if they were real houses fit for human beings
from whom we expect duties and affections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you show me your plan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly. I dare say it is very faulty. But I have been
examining all the plans for cottages in Loudon's book, and picked out
what seem the best things. Oh what a happiness it would be to set the
pattern about here! I think instead of Lazarus at the gate, we should
put the pigsty cottages outside the park-gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was in the best temper now. Sir James, as brother in-law,
building model cottages on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) estate, and then, perhaps, others being
built at Lowick, and more and more elsewhere in imitation--it would be
as if the spirit of Oberlin had passed over the parishes to make the
life of poverty beautiful!

<p/>Sir James saw all the plans, and took one away to consult upon with
Lovegood. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) also took away a complacent sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was making
great progress in Miss Brooke's good opinion. The Maltese puppy was
not offered to Celia; an omission which Dorothea afterwards thought of
with surprise; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) blamed herself for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been engrossing
Sir James. After all, it was a relief that there was no puppy to tread
upon.

<p/>Celia was present while the plans were being examined, and observed Sir
James's illusion. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) thinks that Dodo cares about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) only
cares about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) plans. Yet I am not certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) would refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>)
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lazarus</b></font>) would let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) manage everything and carry out all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>)
notions. And how very uncomfortable Sir James would be! I cannot bear
notions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Celia's private luxury to indulge in this dislike. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) dared
not confess it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister in any direct statement, for that would be
laying herself open to a demonstration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was somehow or other at
war with all goodness. But on safe opportunities, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had an indirect
mode of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) negative wisdom tell upon Dorothea, and calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rhapsodic mood by reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that people were staring,
not listening. Celia was not impulsive: what she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had to say could
wait, and came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) always with the same quiet staccato evenness.
When people talked with energy and emphasis she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) watched their faces and
features merely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) never could understand how well-bred persons
consented to sing and open their mouths in the ridiculous manner
requisite for that vocal exercise.

<p/>It was not many days before Mr. Casaubon paid a morning visit, on which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.
Thus Dorothea had three more conversations with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and was convinced
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first impressions had been just. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was all she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had at first
imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to be: almost everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had said seemed like a
specimen from a mine, or the inscription on the door of a museum which
might open on the treasures of past ages; and this trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mental
wealth was all the deeper and more effective on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inclination because
it was now obvious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) visits were made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sake. This
accomplished man condescended to think of a young girl, and take the
pains to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), not with absurd compliment, but with an appeal to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction. What
delightful companionship! Mr. Casaubon seemed even unconscious that
trivialities existed, and never handed round that small-talk of heavy
men which is as acceptable as stale bride-cake brought forth with an
odor of cupboard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) talked of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was interested in, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
was silent and bowed with sad civility. To Dorothea this was adorable
genuineness, and religious abstinence from that artificiality which
uses up the soul in the efforts of pretence. For she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked as
reverently at Mr. Casaubon's religious elevation above herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
did at his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) intellect and learning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) assented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) expressions of
devout feeling, and usually with an appropriate quotation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) allowed
himself to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had gone through some spiritual conflicts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
youth; in short, Dorothea saw that here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might reckon on
understanding, sympathy, and guidance. On one--only one--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
favorite themes she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was disappointed. Mr. Casaubon apparently did not
care about building cottages, and diverted the talk to the extremely
narrow accommodation which was to be had in the dwellings of the
ancient Egyptians, as if to check a too high standard. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was
gone, Dorothea dwelt with some agitation on this indifference of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>);
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was much exercised with arguments drawn from the varying
conditions of climate which modify human needs, and from the admitted
wickedness of pagan despots. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) not urge these arguments on
Mr. Casaubon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) came again? But further reflection told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was presumptuous in demanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) attention to such a subject; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
would not disapprove of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) occupying herself with it in leisure
moments, as other women expected to occupy themselves with their dress
and embroidery--would not forbid it when--Dorothea felt rather ashamed
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) detected herself in these speculations. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had been
invited to go to Lowick to stay a couple of days: was it reasonable to
suppose that Mr. Casaubon delighted in Mr. Brooke's society for its own
sake, either with or without documents?

<p/>Meanwhile that little disappointment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) delight the more in Sir
James Chettam's readiness to set on foot the desired improvements. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>)
came much oftener than Mr. Casaubon, and Dorothea ceased to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
disagreeable since he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) showed himself so entirely in earnest; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had
already entered with much practical ability into Lovegood's estimates,
and was charmingly docile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) proposed to build a couple of cottages,
and transfer two families from their old cabins, which could then be
pulled down, so that new ones could be built on the old sites. Sir
James said <div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bore the word remarkably well.

<p/>Certainly these men who had so few spontaneous ideas might be very
useful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were
fortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It is difficult to say
whether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) continuing
blind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in
relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life was just now full of hope and action:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not only thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) plans, but getting down learned books
from the library and reading many things hastily -LRB-that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might be a
little less ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon-RRB-, all the while being
visited with conscientious questionings whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were not exalting
these poor doings above measure and contemplating them with that
self-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.



<p/>CHAPTER IV.

<p/>1st Gent. Our deeds are fetters that we forge ourselves.
2d Gent. Ay, truly: but I think it is the world
That brings the iron.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir James seems determined to do everything you wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, as
they were driving home from an inspection of the new building-site.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is a good creature, and more sensible than any one would imagine,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, inconsiderately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) appears silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, recollecting herself, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's a moment, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) does not talk equally well on all
subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister moment</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think none but disagreeable people do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
usual purring way. <div class="bookquote">``They must be very dreadful to live with. Only
think! at breakfast, and always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea laughed. <div class="bookquote">``O Kitty, you are a wonderful creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pinched
Celia's chin, being in the mood now to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) very winning and
lovely--fit hereafter to be an eternal cherub, and if it were not
doctrinally wrong to say so, hardly more in need of salvation than a
squirrel. <div class="bookquote">``Of course people need not be always talking well. Only one
tells the quality of their minds when they try to talk well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that Sir James tries and fails.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking generally. Why do you catechise me about Sir James?
It is not the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life to please me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Dodo, can you really believe that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thinks of me as a future sister--that is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea
had never hinted this before, waiting, from a certain shyness on such
subjects which was mutual between the sisters, until it should be
introduced by some decisive event. Celia blushed, but said at once--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do not make that mistake any longer, Dodo. When Tantripp was
brushing my hair the other day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) said that Sir James's man knew from
Mrs. Cadwallader's maid that Sir James was to marry the eldest Miss
Brooke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you let Tantripp talk such gossip to you, Celia?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, indignantly, not the less angry because details asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
memory were now awakened to confirm the unwelcome revelation. <div class="bookquote">``You
must have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) questions. It is degrading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see no harm at all in Tantripp's talking to me. It is better to
hear what people say. You see what mistakes you make by taking up
notions. I am quite sure that Sir James means to make you an offer;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) believes that you will accept him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), especially since you have
been so pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) about the plans. And uncle too--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
expects it. Every one can see that Sir James is very much in love with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The revulsion was so strong and painful in Dorothea's mind that the
tears welled up and flowed abundantly. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dear plans were
embittered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought with disgust of Sir James's conceiving that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lover. There was vexation too on account of
Celia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How could he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) expect it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) burst forth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) most impetuous manner.
<div class="bookquote">``I have never agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) about anything but the cottages: I was
barely polite to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you have been so pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) since then; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has begun to feel
quite sure that you are fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), Celia! How can you choose such odious expressions?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, passionately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, Dorothea, I suppose it would be right for you to be fond of a
man whom you accepted for a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is offensive to me to say that Sir James could think I was fond of
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Besides, it is not the right word for the feeling I must have
towards the man I would accept as a husband.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am sorry for Sir James. I thought it right to tell you,
because you went on as you always do, never looking just where you are,
and treading in the wrong place. You always see what nobody else sees;
it is impossible to satisfy you; yet you never see what is quite plain.
That's your way, Dodo.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Something certainly gave Celia unusual courage;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was not sparing the sister of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was occasionally in awe.
Who can tell what just criticisms Murr the Cat may be passing on us
beings of wider speculation?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very painful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, feeling scourged. <div class="bookquote">``I can have no
more to do with the cottages. I must be uncivil to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). I must tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) I will have nothing to do with them. It is very painful.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes
filled again with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a little. Think about it. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is going away for a day
or two to see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sister. There will be nobody besides Lovegood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia could not help relenting. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) went on, in an
amiable staccato. <div class="bookquote">``It is very hard: it is your favorite _fad_ to draw
plans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Fad_ to draw plans! Do you think I only care about my
fellow-creatures' houses in that childish way? I may well make
mistakes. How can one ever do anything nobly Christian, living among
people with such petty thoughts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No more was said; Dorothea was too much jarred to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) temper
and behave so as to show that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) admitted any error in herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was disposed rather to accuse the intolerable narrowness and the
purblind conscience of the society around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): and Celia was no longer
the eternal cherub, but a thorn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) spirit, a pink-and-white
nullifidian, worse than any discouraging presence in the <div class="bookquote">``Pilgrim's
Progress.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia the cherub</b></font>)</div>The _fad_ of drawing plans! What was life worth--what great
faith was possible when the whole effect of one's actions could be
withered up into such parched rubbish as that? When she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) got out of the
carriage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) cheeks were pale and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) eyelids red. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was an image
of sorrow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) uncle who met her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) in the hall would have been
alarmed, if Celia had not been close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) looking so pretty and
composed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) at once concluded Dorothea's tears to have their
origin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) excessive religiousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had returned, during their
absence, from a journey to the county town, about a petition for the
pardon of some criminal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dears,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, kindly, as they went up to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I hope
nothing disagreeable has happened while I have been away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, <div class="bookquote">``we have been to Freshitt to look at the
cottages. We thought you would have been at home to lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came by Lowick to lunch--you didn't know I came by Lowick. And I
have brought a couple of pamphlets for you, Dorothea--in the library,
you know; they lie on the table in the library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed as if an electric stream went through Dorothea, thrilling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
from despair into expectation. They were pamphlets about the early
Church. The oppression of Celia, Tantripp, and Sir James was shaken
off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) walked straight to the library. Celia went up-stairs. Mr.
Brooke was detained by a message, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) re-entered the library,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) found Dorothea seated and already deep in one of the pamphlets which
had some marginal manuscript of Mr. Casaubon's,--taking it in as
eagerly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have taken in the scent of a fresh bouquet after a
dry, hot, dreary walk.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was getting away from Tipton and Freshitt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own sad
liability to tread in the wrong places on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) way to the New Jerusalem.

<p/>Mr. Brooke sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) arm-chair, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) legs towards the
wood-fire, which had fallen into a wondrous mass of glowing dice
between the dogs, and rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hands gently, looking very mildly
towards Dorothea, but with a neutral leisurely air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
nothing particular to say. Dorothea closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pamphlet, as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's presence, and rose as if to go. Usually
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have been interested about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's merciful errand on
behalf of the criminal, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) late agitation had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
absent-minded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came back by Lowick, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, not as if with any
intention to arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) departure, but apparently from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) usual
tendency to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had said before. This fundamental principle of
human speech was markedly exhibited in Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``I lunched there
and saw Casaubon's library, and that kind of thing. There's a sharp
air, driving. Won't you sit down, my dear? You look cold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt quite inclined to accept the invitation. Some times,
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's easy way of taking things did not happen to be
exasperating, it was rather soothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) threw off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mantle and
bonnet, and sat down opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), enjoying the glow, but lifting up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) beautiful hands for a screen. They were not thin hands, or small
hands; but powerful, feminine, maternal hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seemed to be
holding them up in propitiation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) passionate desire to know and
to think, which in the unfriendly mediums of Tipton and Freshitt had
issued in crying and red eyelids.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bethought herself now of the condemned criminal. <div class="bookquote">``What news have
you brought about the sheep-stealer, uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, poor Bunch?--well, it seems we can't get him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) off--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is to be
hanged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's brow took an expression of reprobation and pity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hanged, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with a quiet nod. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Romilly!
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would have helped us. I knew Romilly. Casaubon didn't know
Romilly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is a little buried in books, you know, Casaubon is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When a man has great studies and is writing a great work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must of
course give up seeing much of the world. How can he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) go about making
acquaintances?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's true. But a man mopes, you know. I have always been a
bachelor too, but I have that sort of disposition that I never moped;
it was my way to go about everywhere and take in everything. I never
moped: but I can see that Casaubon does, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wants a
companion--a companion, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be a great honor to any one to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) companion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, energetically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You like him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, without showing any surprise, or
other emotion. <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, I've known Casaubon ten years, ever since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) came to Lowick. But I never got anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--any ideas, you
know. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is a tiptop man and may be a bishop--that kind of
thing, you know, if Peel stays in. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) has a very high opinion of
you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea could not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) has a very high opinion indeed of you. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) speaks
uncommonly well--does Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has deferred to me, you not being
of age. In short, I have promised to speak to you, though I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) I
thought there was not much chance. I was bound to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that. I
said, my niece is very young, and that kind of thing. But I didn't
think it necessary to go into everything. However, the long and the
short of it is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has asked my permission to make you an offer of
marriage--of marriage, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) explanatory
nod. <div class="bookquote">``I thought it better to tell you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>No one could have detected any anxiety in Mr. Brooke's manner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
did really wish to know something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) niece's mind, that, if there
were any need for advice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) might give it in time. What feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>),
as a magistrate who had taken in so many ideas, could make room for,
was unmixedly kind. Since Dorothea did not speak immediately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I thought it better to tell you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a clear unwavering tone. <div class="bookquote">``I am
very grateful to Mr. Casaubon. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) makes me an offer, I shall accept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). I admire and honor him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) more than any man I ever saw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke paused a little, and then said in a lingering low tone, <div class="bookquote">``Ah?
... Well! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a good match in some respects. But now, Chettam is
a good match. And our land lies together. I shall never interfere
against your wishes, my dear. People should have their own way in
marriage, and that sort of thing--up to a certain point, you know. I
have always said that, up to a certain point. I wish you to marry
well; and I have good reason to believe that Chettam wishes to marry
you. I mention it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible that I should ever marry Sir James Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) thinks of marrying me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) has made a great mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is it, you see. One never knows. I should have thought Chettam
was just the sort of man a woman would like, now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do not mention him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) in that light again, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
feeling some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) late irritation revive.

<p/>Mr. Brooke wondered, and felt that women were an inexhaustible subject
of study, since even he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) age was not in a perfect state of
scientific prediction about them. Here was a fellow like Chettam with
no chance at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but Casaubon, now. There is no hurry--I mean for you. It's
true, every year will tell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is over five-and-forty, you
know. I should say a good seven-and-twenty years older than you. To
be sure,--if you like learning and standing, and that sort of thing, we
can't have everything. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) income is good--he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has a handsome
property independent of the Church--his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) income is good. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is
not young, and I must not conceal from you, my dear, that I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
health is not over-strong. I know nothing else against him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not wish to have a husband very near my own age,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, with grave decision. <div class="bookquote">``I should wish to have a husband who
was above me in judgment and in all knowledge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) subdued, <div class="bookquote">``Ah?--I thought you had more of your
own opinion than most girls. I thought you liked your own
opinion--liked it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine myself living without some opinions, but I should
wish to have good reasons for them, and a wise man could help me to see
which opinions had the best foundation, and would help me to live
according to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true. You couldn't put the thing better--couldn't put it better,
beforehand, you know. But there are oddities in things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>continued Mr.
Brooke, whose conscience was really roused to do the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) niece on this occasion. <div class="bookquote">``Life isn't cast in a mould--not cut out
by rule and line, and that sort of thing. I never married myself, and
it will be the better for you and yours. The fact is, I never loved
any one well enough to put myself into a noose for them. It _is_ a
noose, you know. Temper, now. There is temper. And a husband likes
to be master.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that I must expect trials, uncle. Marriage is a state of
higher duties. I never thought of it as mere personal ease,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said poor
Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you are not fond of show, a great establishment, balls, dinners,
that kind of thing. I can see that Casaubon's ways might suit you
better than Chettam's. And you shall do as you like, my dear. I would
not hinder Casaubon; I said so at once; for there is no knowing how
anything may turn out. You have not the same tastes as every young
lady; and a clergyman and scholar--who may be a bishop--that kind of
thing--may suit you better than Chettam. Chettam is a good fellow, a
good sound-hearted fellow, you know; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) doesn't go much into ideas.
I did, when I was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) age. But Casaubon's eyes, now. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) has
hurt them a little with too much reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be all the happier, uncle, the more room there was for me to
help him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, ardently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have quite made up your mind, I see. Well, my dear, the fact is,
I have a letter for you in my pocket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke handed the letter to
Dorothea, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose to go away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``There is not too much
hurry, my dear. Think about it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When Dorothea had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had certainly spoken
strongly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had put the risks of marriage before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in a striking
manner. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) duty to do so. But as to pretending to be wise for
young people,--no uncle, however much he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had travelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) youth,
absorbed the new ideas, and dined with celebrities now deceased, could
pretend to judge what sort of marriage would turn out well for a young
girl who preferred Casaubon to Chettam. In short, woman was a problem
which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could be hardly
less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.



<p/>CHAPTER V.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hard students are commonly troubled with gowts, catarrhs,
rheums, cachexia, bradypepsia, bad eyes, stone, and collick,
crudities, oppilations, vertigo, winds, consumptions, and
all such diseases as come by over-much sitting: they are
most part lean, dry, ill-colored ... and all through

<p/>This was Mr. Casaubon's letter.


<p/>MY DEAR MISS BROOKE,--I have your guardian's permission to address you
on a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust,
mistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of
date in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen
contemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with
you. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your
eminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need -LRB-connected, I
may say, with such activity of the affections as even the
preoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not
uninterruptedly dissimulate-RRB-; and each succeeding opportunity for
observation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me
more emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus
evoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now
referred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to
you the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to
the commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation
of thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not
conceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with
those graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer
distinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental
qualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet
with this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive,
adapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant
hours; and but for the event of my introduction to you -LRB-which, let me
again say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with
foreshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages
towards the completion of a life's plan-RRB-, I should presumably have gone
on to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a
matrimonial union.

<p/>Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my feelings;
and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to ask you how far
your own are of a nature to confirm my happy presentiment. To be
accepted by you as your husband and the earthly guardian of your
welfare, I should regard as the highest of providential gifts. In
return I can at least offer you an affection hitherto unwasted, and the
faithful consecration of a life which, however short in the sequel, has
no backward pages whereon, if you choose to turn them, you will find
records such as might justly cause you either bitterness or shame. I
await the expression of your sentiments with an anxiety which it would
be the part of wisdom -LRB-were it possible-RRB- to divert by a more arduous
labor than usual. But in this order of experience I am still young,
and in looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel
that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the temporary
illumination of hope.

<p/>In any case, I shall remain,
Yours with sincere devotion,
EDWARD CASAUBON.


<p/>Dorothea trembled while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) read this letter; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
knees, buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face, and sobbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not pray: under the rush
of solemn emotion in which thoughts became vague and images floated
uncertainly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could but cast herself, with a childlike sense of
reclining, in the lap of a divine consciousness which sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) remained in that attitude till it was time to dress for
dinner.

<p/>How could it occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to examine the letter, to look at it
critically as a profession of love? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole soul was possessed by
the fact that a fuller life was opening before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was a neophyte
about to enter on a higher grade of initiation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to have
room for the energies which stirred uneasily under the dimness and
pressure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own ignorance and the petty peremptoriness of the
world's habits.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties;
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of
proud delight--the joyous maiden surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was chosen by the
man whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) admiration had chosen. All Dorothea's passion was
transfused through a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the
radiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) transfigured girlhood fell on the first object that
came within its level. The impetus with which inclination became
resolution was heightened by those little events of the day which had
roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) discontent with the actual conditions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life.

<p/>After dinner, when Celia was playing an <div class="bookquote">``air, with variations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>a small
kind of tinkling which symbolized the aesthetic part of the young
ladies' education, Dorothea went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) room to answer Mr.
Casaubon's letter. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) defer the answer? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wrote it over
three times, not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wished to change the wording, but because
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand was unusually uncertain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not bear that Mr.
Casaubon should think her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) handwriting bad and illegible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) piqued
herself on writing a hand in which each letter was distinguishable
without any large range of conjecture, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) meant to make much use
of this accomplishment, to save Mr. Casaubon's eyes. Three times she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
wrote.

<p/>MY DEAR MR. CASAUBON,--I am very grateful to you for loving me, and
thinking me worthy to be your wife. I can look forward to no better
happiness than that which would be one with yours. If I said more, it
would only be the same thing written out at greater length, for I
cannot now dwell on any other thought than that I may be through life

<p/>Yours devotedly,
DOROTHEA BROOKE.


<p/>Later in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>BROOKE</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>BROOKE</b></font>) uncle into the library to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) the letter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might send it in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
surprised, but his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) surprise only issued in a few moments' silence,
during which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pushed about various objects on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) writing-table, and
finally stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) back to the fire, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) glasses on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) nose,
looking at the address of Dorothea's letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you thought enough about this, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said at last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was no need to think long, uncle. I know of nothing to make me
vacillate. If I changed my mind, it must be because of something
important and entirely new to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--then you have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)? Then Chettam has no chance? Has
Chettam offended you--offended you, you know? What is it you don't
like in Chettam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is nothing that I like in him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rather
impetuously.

<p/>Mr. Brooke threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) head and shoulders backward as if some one had
thrown a light missile at him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). Dorothea immediately felt some
self-rebuke, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean in the light of a husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is very kind, I think--really
very good about the cottages. A well-meaning man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must have a scholar, and that sort of thing? Well, it lies a
little in our family. I had it myself--that love of knowledge, and
going into everything--a little too much--it took me too far; though
that sort of thing doesn't often run in the female-line; or it runs
underground like the rivers in Greece, you know--it comes out in the
sons. Clever sons, clever mothers. I went a good deal into that, at
one time. However, my dear, I have always said that people should do
as they like in these things, up to a certain point. I couldn't, as
your guardian, have consented to a bad match. But Casaubon stands
well: his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) position is good. I am afraid Chettam will be hurt, though,
and Mrs. Cadwallader will blame me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening, of course, Celia knew nothing of what had happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
attributed Dorothea's abstracted manner, and the evidence of further
crying since they had got home, to the temper she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been in about Sir
James Chettam and the buildings, and was careful not to give further
offence: having once said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted to say, Celia had no
disposition to recur to disagreeable subjects. It had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) nature
when a child never to quarrel with any one--only to observe with wonder
that they quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>), and looked like turkey-cocks; whereupon
she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was ready to play at cat's cradle with them whenever they recovered
themselves. And as to Dorothea, it had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) way to find
something wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's words, though Celia inwardly protested
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) always said just how things were, and nothing else: she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) never
did and never could put words together out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own head. But the
best of Dodo was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) did not keep angry for long together. Now,
though they had hardly spoken to each other all the evening, yet when
Celia put by her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) work, intending to go to bed, a proceeding in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was always much the earlier, Dorothea, who was seated on a low
stool, unable to occupy herself except in meditation, said, with the
musical intonation which in moments of deep but quiet feeling made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
speech like a fine bit of recitative--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Celia, dear, come and kiss me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arms open as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>Celia knelt down to get the right level and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) little butterfly
kiss, while Dorothea encircled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with gentle arms and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
lips gravely on each cheek in turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't sit up, Dodo, you are so pale to-night: go to bed soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said
Celia, in a comfortable way, without any touch of pathos.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, I am very, very happy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, fervently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>thought Celia. <div class="bookquote">``But how strangely Dodo goes from
one extreme to the other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day, at luncheon, the butler, handing something to Mr. Brooke,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Jonas is come back, sir, and has brought this letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke read the letter, and then, nodding toward Dorothea, said,
<div class="bookquote">``Casaubon, my dear: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will be here to dinner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) didn't wait to write
more--didn't wait, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>It could not seem remarkable to Celia that a dinner guest should be
announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister beforehand, but, her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) eyes following the same
direction as her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) uncle's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was struck with the peculiar effect of
the announcement on Dorothea. It seemed as if something like the
reflection of a white sunlit wing had passed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) features,
ending in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rare blushes. For the first time it entered into
Celia's mind that there might be something more between Mr. Casaubon
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister than his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) delight in bookish talk and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) delight in
listening. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had classed the admiration for this <div class="bookquote">``ugly''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
learned acquaintance with the admiration for Monsieur Liret at
Lausanne, also ugly and learned. Dorothea had never been tired of
listening to old Monsieur Liret when Celia's feet were as cold as
possible, and when it had really become dreadful to see the skin of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
bald head moving about. Why then should her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) enthusiasm not extend to
Mr. Casaubon simply in the same way as to Monsieur Liret? And it
seemed probable that all learned men had a sort of schoolmaster's view
of young people.

<p/>But now Celia was really startled at the suspicion which had darted
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was seldom taken by surprise in this way, her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
marvellous quickness in observing a certain order of signs generally
preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) to expect such outward events as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had an interest in.
Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) now imagined Mr. Casaubon to be already an accepted lover:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had only begun to feel disgust at the possibility that anything in
Dorothea's mind could tend towards such an issue. Here was something
really to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) about Dodo: it was all very well not to accept Sir
James Chettam, but the idea of marrying Mr. Casaubon! Celia felt a
sort of shame mingled with a sense of the ludicrous. But perhaps Dodo,
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) were really bordering on such an extravagance, might be turned
away from it: experience had often shown that her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) impressibility might
be calculated on. The day was damp, and they were not going to walk
out, so they both went up to their sitting-room; and there Celia
observed that Dorothea, instead of settling down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual
diligent interest to some occupation, simply leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) elbow on an
open book and looked out of the window at the great cedar silvered with
the damp. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself had taken up the making of a toy for the
curate's children, and was not going to enter on any subject too
precipitately.

<p/>Dorothea was in fact thinking that it was desirable for Celia to know
of the momentous change in Mr. Casaubon's position since he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had last
been in the house: it did not seem fair to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) in ignorance of
what would necessarily affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) attitude towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); but it was
impossible not to shrink from telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>). Dorothea accused herself of
some meanness in this timidity: it was always odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to have any
small fears or contrivances about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) actions, but at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was seeking the highest aid possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might not dread the
corrosiveness of Celia's pretty carnally minded prose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) reverie was
broken, and the difficulty of decision banished, by Celia's small and
rather guttural voice speaking in its usual tone, of a remark aside or
a <div class="bookquote">``by the bye.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is any one else coming to dine besides Mr. Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not that I know of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope there is some one else. Then I shall not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) soup
so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there remarkable about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) soup-eating?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Dodo, can't you hear how he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) scrapes his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) spoon? And he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) always
blinks before he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) speaks. I don't know whether Locke blinked, but I'm
sure I am sorry for those who sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Locke</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Locke</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with emphatic gravity, <div class="bookquote">``pray don't make any
more observations of that kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? They are quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>returned Celia, who had her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) reasons
for persevering, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was beginning to be a little afraid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful. I think it is
a pity Mr. Casaubon's mother had not a commoner mind: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have
taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) better.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia was inwardly frightened, and ready to run
away, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had hurled this light javelin.

<p/>Dorothea's feelings had gathered to an avalanche, and there could be no
further preparation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is right to tell you, Celia, that I am engaged to marry Mr.
Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps Celia had never turned so pale before. The paper man she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was
making would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg injured, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) habitual care of
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) held in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) hands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) laid the fragile figure down at
once, and sat perfectly still for a few moments. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) spoke there
was a tear gathering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dodo, I hope you will be happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sisterly tenderness could not
but surmount other feelings at this moment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) fears were the
fears of affection.

<p/>Dorothea was still hurt and agitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite decided, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, in an awed under tone. <div class="bookquote">``And
uncle knows?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have accepted Mr. Casaubon's offer. My uncle brought me the letter
that contained it; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knew about it beforehand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, if I have said anything to hurt you, Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said
Celia, with a slight sob. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) never could have thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) should
feel as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) did. There was something funereal in the whole affair, and
Mr. Casaubon seemed to be the officiating clergyman, about whom it
would be indecent to make remarks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Kitty, do not grieve. We should never admire the same
people. I often offend in something of the same way; I am apt to speak
too strongly of those who don't please me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>In spite of this magnanimity Dorothea was still smarting: perhaps as
much from Celia's subdued astonishment as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) small criticisms.
Of course all the world round Tipton would be out of sympathy with this
marriage. Dorothea knew of no one who thought as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did about life
and its best objects.

<p/>Nevertheless before the evening was at an end she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was very happy. In
an hour's tete-a-tete with Mr. Casaubon she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) with more
freedom than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ever felt before, even pouring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) joy at the
thought of devoting herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and of learning how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might best
share and further all his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) great ends. Mr. Casaubon was touched with an
unknown delight -LRB-what man would not have been?-RRB- at this childlike
unrestrained ardor: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was not surprised -LRB-what lover would have been?-RRB-
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should be the object of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear young lady--Miss Brooke--Dorothea!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``this is a happiness greater than I had ever
imagined to be in reserve for me. That I should ever meet with a mind
and person so rich in the mingled graces which could render marriage
desirable, was far indeed from my conception. You have all--nay, more
than all--those qualities which I have ever regarded as the
characteristic excellences of womanhood. The great charm of your sex
is its capability of an ardent self-sacrificing affection, and herein
we see its fitness to round and complete the existence of our own.
Hitherto I have known few pleasures save of the severer kind: my
satisfactions have been those of the solitary student. I have been
little disposed to gather flowers that would wither in my hand, but now
I shall pluck them with eagerness, to place them in your bosom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the
frigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the
cawing of an amorous rook. Would it not be rash to conclude that there
was no passion behind those sonnets to Delia which strike us as the
thin music of a mandolin?

<p/>Dorothea's faith supplied all that Mr. Casaubon's words seemed to leave
unsaid: what believer sees a disturbing omission or infelicity? The
text, whether of prophet or of poet, expands for whatever we can put
into it, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) bad grammar is sublime.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very ignorant--you will quite wonder at my ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I have so many thoughts that may be quite mistaken; and now
I shall be able to tell them all to you, and ask you about them. But,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, with rapid imagination of Mr. Casaubon's probable feeling,
<div class="bookquote">``I will not trouble you too much; only when you are inclined to listen
to me. You must often be weary with the pursuit of subjects in your
own track. I shall gain enough if you will take me with you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How should I be able now to persevere in any path without your
companionship?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) candid brow, and feeling
that heaven had vouchsafed him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) a blessing in every way suited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
peculiar wants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was being unconsciously wrought upon by the charms
of a nature which was entirely without hidden calculations either for
immediate effects or for remoter ends. It was this which made Dorothea
so childlike, and, according to some judges, so stupid, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
reputed cleverness; as, for example, in the present case of throwing
herself, metaphorically speaking, at Mr. Casaubon's feet, and kissing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) unfashionable shoe-ties as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were a Protestant Pope. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
not in the least teaching Mr. Casaubon to ask if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were good enough
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), but merely asking herself anxiously how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could be good
enough for Mr. Casaubon. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) left the next day it had been
decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks. Why not?
Mr. Casaubon's house was ready. It was not a parsonage, but a
considerable mansion, with much land attached to it. The parsonage was
inhabited by the curate, who did all the duty except preaching the
morning sermon.



<p/>CHAPTER VI.

<p/>My lady's tongue is like the meadow blades,
That cut you stroking them with idle hand.
Nice cutting is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) function: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) divides
With spiritual edge the millet-seed,
And makes intangible savings.


<p/>As Mr. Casaubon's carriage was passing out of the gateway, it arrested
the entrance of a pony phaeton driven by a lady with a servant seated
behind. It was doubtful whether the recognition had been mutual, for
Mr. Casaubon was looking absently before him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); but the lady was
quick-eyed, and threw a nod and a <div class="bookquote">``How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>in the nick of time.
In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shabby bonnet and very old Indian shawl, it was plain
that the lodge-keeper regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as an important personage, from the
low curtsy which was dropped on the entrance of the small phaeton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Fitchett, how are your fowls laying now?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the
high-colored, dark-eyed lady, with the clearest chiselled utterance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well for laying, madam, but they've ta'en to eating their eggs:
I've no peace o' mind with 'em at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the cannibals! Better sell them cheap at once. What will you
sell them a couple? One can't eat fowls of a bad character at a high
price.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, madam, half-a-crown: I couldn't let 'em go, not under.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Half-a-crown, these times! Come now--for the Rector's chicken-broth
on a Sunday. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) has consumed all ours that I can spare. You are half
paid with the sermon, Mrs. Fitchett, remember that. Take a pair of
tumbler-pigeons for them--little beauties. You must come and see them.
You have no tumblers among your pigeons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, madam, Master Fitchett shall go and see 'em after work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)'s
very hot on new sorts; to oblige you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblige me! It will be the best bargain he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) ever made. A pair of
church pigeons for a couple of wicked Spanish fowls that eat their own
eggs! Don't you and Fitchett boast too much, that is all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fitchett/Fitchett</b></font>)</div><p/>The phaeton was driven onwards with the last words, leaving Mrs.
Fitchett laughing and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fitchett</b></font>) head slowly, with an interjectional
<div class="bookquote">``Sure_ly_, sure_ly_!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fitchett/Fitchett</b></font>)</div>--from which it might be inferred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fitchett</b></font>) would
have found the country-side somewhat duller if the Rector's lady had
been less free-spoken and less of a skinflint. Indeed, both the
farmers and laborers in the parishes of Freshitt and Tipton would have
felt a sad lack of conversation but for the stories about what Mrs.
Cadwallader said and did: a lady of immeasurably high birth, descended,
as it were, from unknown earls, dim as the crowd of heroic shades--who
pleaded poverty, pared down prices, and cut jokes in the most
companionable manner, though with a turn of tongue that let you know
who she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and
religion, and mitigated the bitterness of uncommuted tithe. A much
more exemplary character with an infusion of sour dignity would not
have furthered their comprehension of the Thirty-nine Articles, and
would have been less socially uniting.

<p/>Mr. Brooke, seeing Mrs. Cadwallader's merits from a different point of
view, winced a little when her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) name was announced in the library, where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was sitting alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you have had our Lowick Cicero here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) said, seating herself
comfortably, throwing back her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) wraps, and showing a thin but well-built
figure. <div class="bookquote">``I suspect you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) are brewing some bad polities, else you
would not be seeing so much of the lively man. I shall inform against
you: remember you are both suspicious characters since you took Peel's
side about the Catholic Bill. I shall tell everybody that you are
going to put up for Middlemarch on the Whig side when old Pinkerton
resigns, and that Casaubon is going to help you in an underhand manner:
going to bribe the voters with pamphlets, and throw open the
public-houses to distribute them. Come, confess!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, smiling and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
eye-glasses, but really blushing a little at the impeachment.
<div class="bookquote">``Casaubon and I don't talk politics much. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) doesn't care much about
the philanthropic side of things; punishments, and that kind of thing.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) only cares about Church questions. That is not my line of action,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ra-a-ther too much, my friend. I have heard of your doings. Who was
it that sold his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bit of land to the Papists at Middlemarch? I believe
you bought it on purpose. You are a perfect Guy Faux. See if you are
not burnt in effigy this 5th of November coming. Humphrey would not
come to quarrel with you about it, so I am come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. I was prepared to be persecuted for not persecuting--not
persecuting, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you go! That is a piece of clap-trap you have got ready for the
hustings. Now, _do not_ let them lure you to the hustings, my dear Mr.
Brooke. A man always makes a fool of himself, speechifying: there's no
excuse but being on the right side, so that you can ask a blessing on
your humming and hawing. You will lose yourself, I forewarn you. You
will make a Saturday pie of all parties' opinions, and be pelted by
everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I expect, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, not wishing to
betray how little he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) enjoyed this prophetic sketch--<div class="bookquote">``what I expect as
an independent man. As to the Whigs, a man who goes with the thinkers
is not likely to be hooked on by any party. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may go with them up to
a certain point--up to a certain point, you know. But that is what you
ladies never understand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Where your certain point is? No. I should like to be told how a man
can have any certain point when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belongs to no party--leading a
roving life, and never letting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody
knows where Brooke will be--there's no counting on Brooke'--that is
what people say of you, to be quite frank. Now, do turn respectable.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to argue with a lady on politics,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,
with an air of smiling indifference, but feeling rather unpleasantly
conscious that this attack of Mrs. Cadwallader's had opened the
defensive campaign to which certain rash steps had exposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Your
sex are not thinkers, you know--varium et mutabile semper--that kind of
thing. You don't know Virgil. I knew'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Brooke reflected in time
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had not had the personal acquaintance of the Augustan poet--<div class="bookquote">``I
was going to say, poor Stoddart, you know. That was what _he (<font color='blue'><b>Stoddart</b></font>)_ said.
You ladies are always against an independent attitude--a man's caring
for nothing but truth, and that sort of thing. And there is no part of
the county where opinion is narrower than it is here--I don't mean to
throw stones, you know, but somebody is wanted to take the independent
line; and if I don't take it, who will?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Augustan poet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Why, any upstart who has got neither blood nor position. People
of standing should consume their independent nonsense at home, not hawk
it about. And you! who are going to marry your niece, as good as your
daughter, to one of our best men. Sir James would be cruelly annoyed:
it will be too hard on him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) if you turn round now and make yourself a
Whig sign-board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke again winced inwardly, for Dorothea's engagement had no
sooner been decided, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had thought of Mrs. Cadwallader's
prospective taunts. It might have been easy for ignorant observers to
say, <div class="bookquote">``Quarrel with Mrs. Cadwallader;''  (<font color='red'><b>observers</b></font>)</div>but where is a country gentleman
to go who quarrels with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) oldest neighbors? Who could taste the fine
flavor in the name of Brooke if it were delivered casually, like wine
without a seal? Certainly a man can only be cosmopolitan up to a
certain point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope Chettam and I shall always be good friends; but I am sorry to
say there is no prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) marrying my niece,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,
much relieved to see through the window that Celia was coming in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharp note of surprise. <div class="bookquote">``It
is hardly a fortnight since you and I were talking about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My niece has chosen another suitor--has chosen him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), you know. I have
had nothing to do with it. I should have preferred Chettam; and I
should have said Chettam was the man any girl would have chosen. But
there is no accounting for these things. Your sex is capricious, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, whom do you mean to say that you are going to let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cadwallader's mind was rapidly surveying the possibilities of
choice for Dorothea.

<p/>But here Celia entered, blooming from a walk in the garden, and the
greeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) delivered Mr. Brooke from the necessity of answering
immediately. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) got up hastily, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``By the way, I must speak
to Wright about the horses,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>shuffled quickly out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear child, what is this?--this about your sister's engagement?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is engaged to marry Mr. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, resorting, as
usual, to the simplest statement of fact, and enjoying this opportunity
of speaking to the Rector's wife alone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is frightful. How long has it been going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only knew of it yesterday. They are to be married in six weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I wish you joy of your brother-in-law.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry for Dorothea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry! It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) doing, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) says Mr. Casaubon has a great soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mrs. Cadwallader, I don't think it can be nice to marry a man with
a great soul.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, take warning. You know the look of one now; when the
next comes and wants to marry you, don't you accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sure I never should.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; one such in a family is enough. So your sister never cared about
Sir James Chettam? What would you have said to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>)_ for a
brother-in-law?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have liked that very much. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) would have been a
good husband. Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia added, with a slight blush -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sometimes
seemed to blush as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) breathed-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) would have suited

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not high-flown enough?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dodo is very strict. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thinks so much about everything, and is so
particular about what one says. Sir James never seemed to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must have encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), I am sure. That is not very creditable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't be angry with Dodo; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) does not see things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought
so much about the cottages, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was rude to Sir James sometimes;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is so kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) never noticed it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) shawl, and rising, as if
in haste, <div class="bookquote">``I must go straight to Sir James and break this to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
will have brought his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother back by this time, and I must call. Your
uncle will never tell him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). We are all disappointed, my dear. Young
people should think of their families in marrying. I set a bad
example--married a poor clergyman, and made myself a pitiable object
among the De Bracys--obliged to get my coals by stratagem, and pray to
heaven for my salad oil. However, Casaubon has money enough; I must do
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that justice. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) blood, I suppose the family quarterings
are three cuttle-fish sable, and a commentator rampant. By the bye,
before I go, my dear, I must speak to your Mrs. Carter about pastry. I
want to send my young cook to learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>). Poor people with four
children, like us, you know, can't afford to keep a good cook. I have
no doubt Mrs. Carter will oblige me. Sir James's cook is a perfect
dragon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/>In less than an hour, Mrs. Cadwallader had circumvented Mrs. Carter and
driven to Freshitt Hall, which was not far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) own parsonage, her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
husband being resident in Freshitt and keeping a curate in Tipton.

<p/>Sir James Chettam had returned from the short journey which had kept
him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) absent for a couple of days, and had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) dress, intending
to ride over to Tipton Grange. His (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) horse was standing at the door when
Mrs. Cadwallader drove up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) immediately appeared there himself,
whip in hand. Lady Chettam had not yet returned, but Mrs.
Cadwallader's errand could not be despatched in the presence of grooms,
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) asked to be taken into the conservatory close by, to look at the
new plants; and on coming to a contemplative stand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a great shock for you; I hope you are not so far gone in love
as you pretended to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was of no use protesting, against Mrs. Cadwallader's way of putting
things. But Sir James's countenance changed a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) felt a vague
alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe Brooke is going to expose himself after all. I accused
him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) of meaning to stand for Middlemarch on the Liberal side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>)
looked silly and never denied it--talked about the independent line,
and the usual nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, much relieved.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Cadwallader, with a sharper note, <div class="bookquote">``you don't mean
to say that you would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) to turn public man in that way--making a
sort of political Cheap Jack of himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) might be dissuaded, I should think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would not like the expense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) is vulnerable to reason there--always a
few grains of common-sense in an ounce of miserliness. Miserliness is
a capital quality to run in families; it's the safe side for madness to
dip on. And there must be a little crack in the Brooke family, else we
should not see what we are to see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? Brooke standing for Middlemarch?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Worse than that. I really feel a little responsible. I always told
you Miss Brooke would be such a fine match. I knew there was a great
deal of nonsense in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)--a flighty sort of Methodistical stuff. But
these things wear out of girls. However, I am taken by surprise for
once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Mrs. Cadwallader?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fear lest
Miss Brooke should have run away to join the Moravian Brethren, or some
preposterous sect unknown to good society, was a little allayed by the
knowledge that Mrs. Cadwallader always made the worst of things. <div class="bookquote">``What
has happened to Miss Brooke? Pray speak out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is engaged to be married.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cadwallader paused a
few moments, observing the deeply hurt expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) friend's face,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was trying to conceal by a nervous smile, while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) whipped his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
boot; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) soon added, <div class="bookquote">``Engaged to Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James let his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) whip fall and stooped to pick it up. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
face had never before gathered so much concentrated disgust as when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
turned to Mrs. Cadwallader and repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Even so. You know my errand now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! It is horrible! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is no better than a mummy!''  (<font color='red'><b>a rival</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The point

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What business has an old bachelor like that to marry?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) has one foot in the grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) means to draw it out again, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brooke ought not to allow it: he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) should insist on its being put off
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is of age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would think better of it then. What is a
guardian for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if you could ever squeeze a resolution out of Brooke!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cadwallader might talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)! Humphrey finds everybody charming. I never can get him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) to
abuse Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) will even speak well of the bishop, though I tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) it is unnatural in a beneficed clergyman; what can one do with a
husband who attends so little to the decencies? I hide it as well as I
can by abusing everybody myself. Come, come, cheer up! you are well
rid of Miss Brooke, a girl who would have been requiring you to see the
stars by daylight. Between ourselves, little Celia is worth two of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>), and likely after all to be the better match. For this marriage to
Casaubon is as good as going to a nunnery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, on my own account--it is for Miss Brooke's sake I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
friends should try to use their influence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``Well, Humphrey doesn't know yet. But when I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>), you may depend
on it he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) will say, ``Why not? Casaubon is a good fellow--and
young--young enough.<div class="bookquote">'' These charitable people never know vinegar from
wine till they have swallowed it and got the colic. However, if I were
a man I should prefer Celia, especially when Dorothea was gone. The
truth is, you have been courting one and have won the other. I can see
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) admires you almost as much as a man expects to be admired. If
it were any one but me who said so, you might think it exaggeration.
Good-by!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Casaubon a fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James handed Mrs. Cadwallader to the phaeton, and then jumped on
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) horse. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was not going to renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ride because of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
friend's unpleasant news--only to ride the faster in some other
direction than that of Tipton Grange.

<p/>Now, why on earth should Mrs. Cadwallader have been at all busy about
Miss Brooke's marriage; and why, when one match that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) liked to think
she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had a hand in was frustrated, should she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) have straightway contrived
the preliminaries of another? Was there any ingenious plot, any
hide-and-seek course of action, which might be detected by a careful
telescopic watch? Not at all: a telescope might have swept the
parishes of Tipton and Freshitt, the whole area visited by Mrs.
Cadwallader in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) phaeton, without witnessing any interview that could
excite suspicion, or any scene from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) did not return with the
same unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color. In
fact, if that convenient vehicle had existed in the days of the Seven
Sages, one of them would doubtless have remarked, that you can know
little of women by following them about in their pony-phaetons. Even
with a microscope directed on a water-drop we find ourselves making
interpretations which turn out to be rather coarse; for whereas under a
weak lens you may seem to see a creature exhibiting an active voracity
into which other smaller creatures actively play as if they were so
many animated tax-pennies, a stronger lens reveals to you certain
tiniest hairlets which make vortices for these victims while the
swallower waits passively at his (<font color='blue'><b>Sages</b></font>) receipt of custom. In this way,
metaphorically speaking, a strong lens applied to Mrs. Cadwallader's
match-making will show a play of minute causes producing what may be
called thought and speech vortices to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) the sort of food she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
needed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either
foul, dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected
by the great affairs of the world. All the more did the affairs of the
great world interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>), when communicated in the letters of high-born
relations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the
dogs by marrying their mistresses; the fine old-blooded idiocy of young
Lord Tapir, and the furious gouty humors of old Lord Megatherium; the
exact crossing of genealogies which had brought a coronet into a new
branch and widened the relations of scandal,--these were topics of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) retained details with the utmost accuracy, and reproduced
them in an excellent pickle of epigrams, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) herself enjoyed the
more because she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) believed as unquestionably in birth and no-birth as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) did in game and vermin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) would never have disowned any one on
the ground of poverty: a De Bracy reduced to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dinner in a basin
would have seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I
fear his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) aristocratic vices would not have horrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
feeling towards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred: they
had probably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs.
Cadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid in
kind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God's design in making
the world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. A town
where such monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort of low comedy,
which could not be taken account of in a well-bred scheme of the
universe. Let any lady who is inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader
inquire into the comprehensiveness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) own beautiful views, and be
quite sure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have
the honor to coexist with hers.

<p/>With such a mind, active as phosphorus, biting everything that came
near into the form that suited it, how could Mrs. Cadwallader feel that
the Miss Brookes and their matrimonial prospects were alien to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>)?
especially as it had been the habit of years for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) to scold Mr.
Brooke with the friendliest frankness, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) know in confidence
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) a poor creature. From the first arrival of the
young ladies in Tipton she (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) had prearranged Dorothea's marriage with Sir
James, and if it had taken place would have been quite sure that it was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) doing: that it should not take place after she (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) had preconceived it,
caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) an irritation which every thinker will sympathize with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>)
was the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) was an offensive irregularity. As to freaks like this
of Miss Brooke's, Mrs. Cadwallader had no patience with them, and now
saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) opinion of this girl had been infected with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
husband's weak charitableness: those Methodistical whims, that air of
being more religious than the rector and curate together, came from a
deeper and more constitutional disease than she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) had been willing to
believe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, first to herself and afterwards to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``I throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) over: there was a chance, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had married
Sir James, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) becoming a sane, sensible woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would never have
contradicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), and when a woman is not contradicted, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has no
motive for obstinacy in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) absurdities. But now I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
hair shirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>It followed that Mrs. Cadwallader must decide on another match for Sir
James, and having made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) mind that it was to be the younger Miss
Brooke, there could not have been a more skilful move towards the
success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) plan than her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hint to the baronet that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had made an
impression on Celia's heart. For he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was not one of those gentlemen who
languish after the unattainable Sappho's apple that laughs from the
topmost bough--the charms which

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Smile like the knot of cowslips on the cliff,
Not to be come at by the willing hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Sappho</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had no sonnets to write, and it could not strike him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) agreeably that
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was not an object of preference to the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had preferred.
Already the knowledge that Dorothea had chosen Mr. Casaubon had bruised
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) attachment and relaxed its hold. Although Sir James was a
sportsman, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse
and foxes, and did not regard his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) future wife in the light of prey,
valuable chiefly for the excitements of the chase. Neither was he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) so
well acquainted with the habits of primitive races as to feel that an
ideal combat for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), tomahawk in hand, so to speak, was necessary to
the historical continuity of the marriage-tie. On the contrary, having
the amiable vanity which knits us to those who are fond of us, and
disinclines us to those who are indifferent, and also a good grateful
nature, the mere idea that a woman had a kindness towards him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) spun
little threads of tenderness from out his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) heart towards hers.

<p/>Thus it happened, that after Sir James had ridden rather fast for half
an hour in a direction away from Tipton Grange, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) pace,
and at last turned into a road which would lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) back by a shorter
cut. Various feelings wrought in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) the determination after all to go
to the Grange to-day as if nothing new had happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) could not help
rejoicing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) had never made the offer and been rejected; mere
friendly politeness required that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) should call to see Dorothea about
the cottages, and now happily Mrs. Cadwallader had prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) to
offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) congratulations, if necessary, without showing too much
awkwardness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) really did not like it: giving up Dorothea was very
painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>); but there was something in the resolve to make this
visit forthwith and conquer all show of feeling, which was a sort of
file-biting and counter-irritant. And without his (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) distinctly
recognizing the impulse, there certainly was present in him (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) the sense
that Celia would be there, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) should pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) more attention
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between
breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale
about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>Pride
helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide
our own hurts--not to hurt others.



<p/>CHAPTER VII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Piacer e popone
Vuol la sua stagione.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Italian Proverb.


<p/>Mr. Casaubon, as might be expected, spent a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) time at
the Grange in these weeks, and the hindrance which courtship occasioned
to the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) great work--the Key to all
Mythologies--naturally made him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) look forward the more eagerly to the
happy termination of courtship. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had deliberately incurred the
hindrance, having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind that it was now time for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to
adorn his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) life with the graces of female companionship, to irradiate
the gloom which fatigue was apt to hang over the intervals of studious
labor with the play of female fancy, and to secure in this, his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
culminating age, the solace of female tendance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) declining years.
Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) determined to abandon himself to the stream of feeling, and
perhaps was surprised to find what an exceedingly shallow rill it was.
As in droughty regions baptism by immersion could only be performed
symbolically, Mr. Casaubon found that sprinkling was the utmost
approach to a plunge which his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) stream would afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
concluded that the poets had much exaggerated the force of masculine
passion. Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) observed with pleasure that Miss Brooke
showed an ardent submissive affection which promised to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) most
agreeable previsions of marriage. It had once or twice crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
mind that possibly there was some deficiency in Dorothea to account for
the moderation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) abandonment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was unable to discern the
deficiency, or to figure to himself a woman who would have pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
better; so that there was clearly no reason to fall back upon but the
exaggerations of human tradition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), one morning, early in the time of courtship; <div class="bookquote">``could I not learn
to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton's daughters did to
their father, without understanding what they read?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that would be wearisome to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, smiling;
<div class="bookquote">``and, indeed, if I remember rightly, the young women you have mentioned
regarded that exercise in unknown tongues as a ground for rebellion
against the poet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but in the first place they were very naughty girls, else they
would have been proud to minister to such a father; and in the second
place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to
understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting. I
hope you don't expect me to be naughty and stupid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect you to be all that an exquisite young lady can be in every
possible relation of life. Certainly it might be a great advantage if
you were able to copy the Greek character, and to that end it were well
to begin with a little reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea seized this as a precious permission. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would not have
asked Mr. Casaubon at once to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the languages, dreading of all
things to be tiresome instead of helpful; but it was not entirely out
of devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) future husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wished to know Latin and
Greek. Those provinces of masculine knowledge seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) a
standing-ground from which all truth could be seen more truly. As it
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) constantly doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own conclusions, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own ignorance: how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) be confident that one-roomed cottages were
not for the glory of God, when men who knew the classics appeared to
conciliate indifference to the cottages with zeal for the glory?
Perhaps even Hebrew might be necessary--at least the alphabet and a few
roots--in order to arrive at the core of things, and judge soundly on
the social duties of the Christian. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not reached that point
of renunciation at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have been satisfied with having a
wise husband: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wished, poor child, to be wise herself. Miss Brooke
was certainly very naive with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) alleged cleverness. Celia, whose
mind had never been thought too powerful, saw the emptiness of other
people's pretensions much more readily. To have in general but little
feeling, seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any
particular occasion.

<p/>However, Mr. Casaubon consented to listen and teach for an hour
together, like a schoolmaster of little boys, or rather like a lover,
to whom a mistress's elementary ignorance and difficulties have a
touching fitness. Few scholars would have disliked teaching the
alphabet under such circumstances. But Dorothea herself was a little
shocked and discouraged at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own stupidity, and the answers she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) got
to some timid questions about the value of the Greek accents gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) a
painful suspicion that here indeed there might be secrets not capable
of explanation to a woman's reason.

<p/>Mr. Brooke had no doubt on that point, and expressed himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
usual strength upon it one day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) came into the library while the
reading was going forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but now, Casaubon, such deep studies, classics, mathematics,
that kind of thing, are too taxing for a woman--too taxing, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea is learning to read the characters simply,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Casaubon, evading the question. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had the very considerate thought
of saving my eyes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, without understanding, you know--that may not be so bad.
But there is a lightness about the feminine mind--a touch and
go--music, the fine arts, that kind of thing--they should study those
up to a certain point, women should; but in a light way, you know. A
woman should be able to sit down and play you or sing you a good old
English tune. That is what I like; though I have heard most
things--been at the opera in Vienna: Gluck, Mozart, everything of that
sort. But I'm a conservative in music--it's not like ideas, you know.
I stick to the good old tunes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon is not fond of the piano, and I am very glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is not,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, whose slight regard for domestic music and feminine fine
art must be forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), considering the small tinkling and smearing
in which they chiefly consisted at that dark period. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) smiled and
looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) betrothed with grateful eyes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had always been
asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to play the <div class="bookquote">``Last Rose of Summer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have required
much resignation. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) says there is only an old harpsichord at Lowick,
and it is covered with books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there you are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very
prettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does
not like it, you are all right. But it's a pity you should not have
little recreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung--that
kind of thing, you know--will not do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never could look on it in the light of a recreation to have my ears
teased with measured noises,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon. <div class="bookquote">``A tune much iterated
has the ridiculous effect of making the words in my mind perform a sort
of minuet to keep time--an effect hardly tolerable, I imagine, after
boyhood. As to the grander forms of music, worthy to accompany solemn
celebrations, and even to serve as an educating influence according to
the ancient conception, I say nothing, for with these we are not
immediately concerned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but music of that sort I should enjoy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``When we
were coming home from Lausanne my uncle took us to hear the great organ
at Freiberg, and it made me sob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That kind of thing is not healthy, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``Casaubon, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) will be in your hands now: you must teach my niece to
take things more quietly, eh, Dorothea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) ended with a smile, not wishing to hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) niece, but really
thinking that it was perhaps better for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to be early married to so
sober a fellow as Casaubon, since she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would not hear of Chettam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is wonderful, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) shuffled out of the
room--<div class="bookquote">``it is wonderful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). However, the
match is good. I should have been travelling out of my brief to have
hindered it, let Mrs. Cadwallader say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is pretty
certain to be a bishop, is Casaubon. That was a very seasonable
pamphlet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) on the Catholic Question:--a deanery at least. They
owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) a deanery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And here I must vindicate a claim to philosophical reflectiveness, by
remarking that Mr. Brooke on this occasion little thought of the
Radical speech which, at a later period, he (<font color='blue'><b>Radical</b></font>) was led to make on the
incomes of the bishops. What elegant historian would neglect a
striking opportunity for pointing out that his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) heroes did not foresee
the history of the world, or even their own actions?--For example, that
Henry of Navarre, when a Protestant baby, little thought of being a
Catholic monarch; or that Alfred the Great, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) measured his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
laborious nights with burning candles, had no idea of future gentlemen
measuring their idle days with watches. Here is a mine of truth,
which, however vigorously it may be worked, is likely to outlast our
coal.

<p/>But of Mr. Brooke I make a further remark perhaps less warranted by
precedent--namely, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had foreknown his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) speech, it might not
have made any great difference. To think with pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) niece's
husband having a large ecclesiastical income was one thing--to make a
Liberal speech was another thing; and it is a narrow mind which cannot
look at a subject from various points of view.



<p/>CHAPTER VIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)! I am her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) brother now,
And you her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) father. Every gentle maid
Should have a guardian in each gentleman.''


 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>It was wonderful to Sir James Chettam how well he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) continued to like
going to the Grange after he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) had once encountered the difficulty of
seeing Dorothea for the first time in the light of a woman who was
engaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass
through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first approached her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained conscious
throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, it
must be owned that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uneasiness was less than it would have been if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rival a brilliant and desirable match. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no
sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was only shocked that
Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mortification lost
some of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion.

<p/>Nevertheless, while Sir James said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had completely
resigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), since with the perversity of a Desdemona she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not
affected a proposed match that was clearly suitable and according to
nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could not yet be quite passive under the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
engagement to Mr. Casaubon. On the day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) first saw them together
in the light of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) present knowledge, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not
taken the affair seriously enough. Brooke was really culpable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
ought to have hindered it. Who could speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)? Something might be
done perhaps even now, at least to defer the marriage. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) way home
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) turned into the Rectory and asked for Mr. Cadwallader. Happily, the
Rector was at home, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) visitor was shown into the study, where all
the fishing tackle hung. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) himself was in a little room
adjoining, at work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) turning apparatus, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) called to the
baronet to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) there. The two were better friends than any other
landholder and clergyman in the county--a significant fact which was in
agreement with the amiable expression of their faces.

<p/>Mr. Cadwallader was a large man, with full lips and a sweet smile; very
plain and rough in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) exterior, but with that solid imperturbable ease
and good-humor which is infectious, and like great grassy hills in the
sunshine, quiets even an irritated egoism, and makes it rather ashamed
of itself. <div class="bookquote">``Well, how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) said, showing a hand not quite fit
to be grasped. <div class="bookquote">``Sorry I missed you before. Is there anything
particular? You look vexed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James's brow had a little crease in it, a little depression of the
eyebrow, which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) seemed purposely to exaggerate as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) answered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only this conduct of Brooke's. I really think somebody should
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? meaning to stand?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cadwallader, going on with the
arrangement of the reels which he (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) had just been turning. <div class="bookquote">``I hardly
think he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) means it. But where's the harm, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) likes it? Any one who
objects to Whiggery should be glad when the Whigs don't put up the
strongest fellow. They won't overturn the Constitution with our friend
Brooke's head for a battering ram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't mean that,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, who, after putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
hat and throwing himself into a chair, had begun to nurse his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) leg and
examine the sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) boot with much bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``I mean this
marriage. I mean his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) letting that blooming young girl marry Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter with Casaubon? I see no harm in him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--if the girl
likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is too young to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) likes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) guardian ought to
interfere. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) ought not to allow the thing to be done in this headlong
manner. I wonder a man like you, Cadwallader--a man with daughters,
can look at the affair with indifference: and with such a heart as
yours! Do think seriously about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not joking; I am as serious as possible,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, with a
provoking little inward laugh. <div class="bookquote">``You are as bad as Elinor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) has
been wanting me to go and lecture Brooke; and I have reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) friends had a very poor opinion of the match she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) made when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
married me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look at Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be
fifty, and I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could ever have been much more than the
shadow of a man. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound you handsome young fellows! you think of having it all your
own way in the world. You don't under stand women. They don't admire
you half so much as you admire yourselves. Elinor used to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sisters that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) married me for my ugliness--it was so various and
amusing that it had quite conquered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) prudence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You! it was easy enough for a woman to love you. But this is no
question of beauty. I don't _like_ Casaubon.''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>This was Sir James's
strongest way of implying that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thought ill of a man's character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? what do you know against him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>)
reels, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) thumbs into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) armholes with an air of
attention.

<p/>Sir James paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not usually find it easy to give his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) reasons:
it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) strange that people should not know them without being
told, since he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) only felt what was reasonable. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Cadwallader, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) got any heart?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, yes. I don't mean of the melting sort, but a sound kernel,
_that_ you may be sure of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is very good to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) poor relations:
pensions several of the women, and is educating a young fellow at a
good deal of expense. Casaubon acts up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sense of justice. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
mother's sister made a bad match--a Pole, I think--lost herself--at any
rate was disowned by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) family. If it had not been for that, Casaubon
would not have had so much money by half. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) went himself to
find out his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cousins, and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could do for them. Every man
would not ring so well as that, if you tried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) metal. _You_ would,
Chettam; but not every man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, coloring. <div class="bookquote">``I am not so sure of
myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) paused a moment, and then added, <div class="bookquote">``That was a right thing
for Casaubon to do. But a man may wish to do what is right, and yet be
a sort of parchment code. A woman may not be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). And I
think when a girl is so young as Miss Brooke is, her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) friends ought to
interfere a little to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) from doing anything foolish. You
laugh, because you fancy I have some feeling on my own account. But
upon my honor, it is not that. I should feel just the same if I were
Miss Brooke's brother or uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but what should you do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say that the marriage must not be decided on until she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was of
age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. I
wish you saw it as I do--I wish you would talk to Brooke about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James rose as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sentence, for he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) saw Mrs.
Cadwallader entering from the study. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) held by the hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) youngest
girl, about five years old, who immediately ran to papa, and was made
comfortable on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hear what you are talking about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife. <div class="bookquote">``But you will make
no impression on Humphrey. As long as the fish rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) bait,
everybody is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) ought to be. Bless you, Casaubon has got a
trout-stream, and does not care about fishing in it himself: could
there be a better fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there is something in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) quiet,
inward laugh. <div class="bookquote">``It is a very good quality in a man to have a
trout-stream.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But seriously,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, whose vexation had not yet spent
itself, <div class="bookquote">``don't you think the Rector might do some good by speaking?''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I told you beforehand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) would say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs.
Cadwallader, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) eyebrows. <div class="bookquote">``I have done what I could: I
wash my hands of the marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the first place,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, looking rather grave, <div class="bookquote">``it would
be nonsensical to expect that I could convince Brooke, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) act
accordingly. Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) will run into
any mould, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) won't keep shape.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) might keep shape long enough to defer the marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Chettam, why should I use my influence to Casaubon's
disadvantage, unless I were much surer than I am that I should be
acting for the advantage of Miss Brooke? I know no harm of Casaubon.
I don't care about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) Xisuthrus and Fee-fo-fum and the rest; but then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) doesn't care about my fishing-tackle. As to the line he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) took on the
Catholic Question, that was unexpected; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has always been civil to
me, and I don't see why I should spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sport. For anything I can
tell, Miss Brooke may be happier with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would be with any
other man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humphrey! I have no patience with you. You know you would rather
dine under the hedge than with Casaubon alone. You have nothing to say
to each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What has that to do with Miss Brooke's marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) does not do

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass and it was all

James, with a disgust which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) held warranted by the sound feeling of
an English layman.

<p/>``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) brains. They
say, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was a little boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) made an abstract of ``Hop o' my

the man Humphrey goes on saying that a woman may be happy with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is what Miss Brooke likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
profess to understand every young lady's taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) were your own daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be a different affair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is _not_ my daughter, and I
don't feel called upon to interfere. Casaubon is as good as most of
us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is a scholarly clergyman, and creditable to the cloth. Some
Radical fellow speechifying at Middlemarch said Casaubon was the
learned straw-chopping incumbent, and Freke was the brick-and-mortar
incumbent, and I was the angling incumbent. And upon my word, I don't
see that one is worse or better than the other.''  (<font color='red'><b>The Rector</b></font>)</div>The Rector ended with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) silent laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) always saw the joke of any satire against
himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) conscience was large and easy, like the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>): it
did only what it could do without any trouble.

<p/>Clearly, there would be no interference with Miss Brooke's marriage
through Mr. Cadwallader; and Sir James felt with some sadness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
was to have perfect liberty of misjudgment. It was a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) good
disposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not slacken at all in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) intention of carrying
out Dorothea's design of the cottages. Doubtless this persistence was
the best course for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own dignity: but pride only helps us to be
generous; it never makes us so, any more than vanity makes us witty.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was now enough aware of Sir James's position with regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), to
appreciate the rectitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) perseverance in a landlord's duty, to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had at first been urged by a lover's complaisance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
pleasure in it was great enough to count for something even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
present happiness. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gave to Sir James Chettam's cottages
all the interest she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could spare from Mr. Casaubon, or rather from the
symphony of hopeful dreams, admiring trust, and passionate self
devotion which that learned gentleman had set playing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) soul.
Hence it happened that in the good baronet's succeeding visits, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was beginning to pay small attentions to Celia, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) found himself
talking with more and more pleasure to Dorothea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was perfectly
unconstrained and without irritation towards him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
gradually discovering the delight there is in frank kindness and
companionship between a man and a woman who have no passion to hide or
confess.



<p/>CHAPTER IX.

<p/>1st Gent. An ancient land in ancient oracles
Is called <div class="bookquote">``law-thirsty'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>: all the struggle there
Was after order and a perfect rule.
Pray, where lie such lands now? ...
2d Gent. Why, where they lay of old--in human souls.


<p/>Mr. Casaubon's behavior about settlements was highly satisfactory to
Mr. Brooke, and the preliminaries of marriage rolled smoothly along,
shortening the weeks of courtship. The betrothed bride must see her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)
future home, and dictate any changes that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would like to have made
there. A woman dictates before marriage in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have an
appetite for submission afterwards. And certainly, the mistakes that
we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly
raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.

<p/>On a gray but dry November morning Dorothea drove to Lowick in company
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle and Celia. Mr. Casaubon's home was the manor-house.
Close by, visible from some parts of the garden, was the little church,
with the old parsonage opposite. In the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) career, Mr.
Casaubon had only held the living, but the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) brother had put
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in possession of the manor also. It had a small park, with a fine
old oak here and there, and an avenue of limes towards the southwest
front, with a sunk fence between park and pleasure-ground, so that from
the drawing-room windows the glance swept uninterruptedly along a slope
of greensward till the limes ended in a level of corn and pastures,
which often seemed to melt into a lake under the setting sun. This was
the happy side of the house, for the south and east looked rather
melancholy even under the brightest morning. The grounds here were
more confined, the flower-beds showed no very careful tendance, and
large clumps of trees, chiefly of sombre yews, had risen high, not ten
yards from the windows. The building, of greenish stone, was in the
old English style, not ugly, but small-windowed and melancholy-looking:
the sort of house that must have children, many flowers, open windows,
and little vistas of bright things, to make it seem a joyous home. In
this latter end of autumn, with a sparse remnant of yellow leaves
falling slowly athwart the dark evergreens in a stillness without
sunshine, the house too had an air of autumnal decline, and Mr.
Casaubon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) presented himself, had no bloom that could be thrown
into relief by that background.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia said to herself, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure Freshitt Hall would have
been pleasanter than this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) thought of the white freestone, the
pillared portico, and the terrace full of flowers, Sir James smiling
above them like a prince issuing from his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) enchantment in a rose-bush,
with a handkerchief swiftly metamorphosed from the most delicately
odorous petals--Sir James, who talked so agreeably, always about things
which had common-sense in them, and not about learning! Celia had
those light young feminine tastes which grave and weatherworn gentlemen
sometimes prefer in a wife; but happily Mr. Casaubon's bias had been
different, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have had no chance with Celia.

<p/>Dorothea, on the contrary, found the house and grounds all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
could wish: the dark book-shelves in the long library, the carpets and
curtains with colors subdued by time, the curious old maps and
bird's-eye views on the walls of the corridor, with here and there an
old vase below, had no oppression for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and seemed more cheerful
than the easts and pictures at the Grange, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had long ago
brought home from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) travels--they being probably among the ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
had taken in at one time. To poor Dorothea these severe classical
nudities and smirking Renaissance-Correggiosities were painfully
inexplicable, staring into the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) Puritanic conceptions: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had never been taught how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could bring them into any sort of
relevance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life. But the owners of Lowick apparently had not
been travellers, and Mr. Casaubon's studies of the past were not
carried on by means of such aids.

<p/>Dorothea walked about the house with delightful emotion. Everything
seemed hallowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): this was to be the home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wifehood, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked up with eyes full of confidence to Mr. Casaubon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) drew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attention specially to some actual arrangement and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
would like an alteration. All appeals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) taste she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) met gratefully,
but saw nothing to alter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) efforts at exact courtesy and formal
tenderness had no defect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) filled up all blanks with
unmanifested perfections, interpreting him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) interpreted the works
of Providence, and accounting for seeming discords by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own deafness
to the higher harmonies. And there are many blanks left in the weeks
of courtship which a loving faith fills with happy assurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, my dear Dorothea, I wish you to favor me by pointing out which
room you would like to have as your boudoir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon,
showing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to
include that requirement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of you to think of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``but I assure
you I would rather have all those matters decided for me. I shall be
much happier to take everything as it is--just as you have been used to
have it, or as you will yourself choose it to be. I have no motive for
wishing anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, <div class="bookquote">``will you not have the bow-windowed room
up-stairs?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon led the way thither. The bow-window looked down the
avenue of limes; the furniture was all of a faded blue, and there were
miniatures of ladies and gentlemen with powdered hair hanging in a
group. A piece of tapestry over a door also showed a blue-green world
with a pale stag in it. The chairs and tables were thin-legged and
easy to upset. It was a room where one might fancy the ghost of a
tight-laced lady revisiting the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) embroidery. A light
bookcase contained duodecimo volumes of polite literature in calf,
completing the furniture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``this would be a pretty room with some new
hangings, sofas, and that sort of thing. A little bare now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Pray do not speak of altering
anything. There are so many other things in the world that want
altering--I like to take these things as they are. And you like them
as they are, don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, looking at Mr. Casaubon. <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps
this was your mother's room when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) slow bend of the head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is your mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, who had turned to examine the
group of miniatures. <div class="bookquote">``It is like the tiny one you brought me; only, I
should think, a better portrait. And this one opposite, who is this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) elder sister. They were, like you and your sister, the only two
children of their parents, who hang above them, you see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The sister is pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, implying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) thought less
favorably of Mr. Casaubon's mother. It was a new opening to Celia's
imagination, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) came of a family who had all been young in their
time--the ladies wearing necklaces.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a peculiar face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, looking closely. <div class="bookquote">``Those deep
gray eyes rather near together--and the delicate irregular nose with a
sort of ripple in it--and all the powdered curls hanging backward.
Altogether it seems to me peculiar rather than pretty. There is not
even a family likeness between her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. And they were not alike in their lot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not mention her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My aunt made an unfortunate marriage. I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea wondered a little, but felt that it would be indelicate just
then to ask for any information which Mr. Casaubon did not proffer, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) turned to the window to admire the view. The sun had lately
pierced the gray, and the avenue of limes cast shadows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall we not walk in the garden now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you would like to see the church, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``It
is a droll little church. And the village. It all lies in a
nut-shell. By the way, it will suit you, Dorothea; for the cottages are
like a row of alms-houses--little gardens, gilly-flowers, that sort of
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, looking at Mr. Casaubon, <div class="bookquote">``I should like
to see all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had got nothing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) more graphic about the
Lowick cottages than that they were <div class="bookquote">``not bad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They were soon on a gravel walk which led chiefly between grassy
borders and clumps of trees, this being the nearest way to the church,
Mr. Casaubon said. At the little gate leading into the churchyard
there was a pause while Mr. Casaubon went to the parsonage close by to
fetch a key. Celia, who had been hanging a little in the rear, came up
presently, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) saw that Mr. Casaubon was gone away, and said in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) easy staccato, which always seemed to contradict the suspicion of
any malicious intent--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Dorothea, I saw some one quite young coming up one of the
walks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that astonishing, Celia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There may be a young gardener, you know--why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``I told Casaubon he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) gardener.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not a gardener,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia; <div class="bookquote">``a gentleman with a sketch-book. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
had light-brown curls. I only saw his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back. But he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was quite young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The curate's son, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, there is Casaubon
again, and Tucker with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is going to introduce Tucker. You
don't know Tucker yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tucker/Tucker</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tucker was the middle-aged curate, one of the <div class="bookquote">``inferior clergy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tucker the curate</b></font>)</div>who are usually not wanting in sons. But after the introduction, the
conversation did not lead to any question about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) family, and the
startling apparition of youthfulness was forgotten by every one but
Celia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) inwardly declined to believe that the light-brown curls and
slim figure could have any relationship to Mr. Tucker, who was just as
old and musty-looking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) would have expected Mr. Casaubon's curate
to be; doubtless an excellent man who would go to heaven -LRB-for Celia
wished not to be unprincipled-RRB-, but the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mouth were so
unpleasant. Celia thought with some dismalness of the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) should
have to spend as bridesmaid at Lowick, while the curate had probably no
pretty little children whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) could like, irrespective of principle.

<p/>Mr. Tucker was invaluable in their walk; and perhaps Mr. Casaubon had
not been without foresight on this head, the curate being able to
answer all Dorothea's questions about the villagers and the other
parishioners. Everybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), was well off in Lowick: not a
cottager in those double cottages at a low rent but kept a pig, and the
strips of garden at the back were well tended. The small boys wore
excellent corduroy, the girls went out as tidy servants, or did a
little straw-plaiting at home: no looms here, no Dissent; and though
the public disposition was rather towards laying by money than towards
spirituality, there was not much vice. The speckled fowls were so
numerous that Mr. Brooke observed, <div class="bookquote">``Your farmers leave some barley for
the women to glean, I see. The poor folks here might have a fowl in
their pot, as the good French king used to wish for all his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) people.
The French eat a good many fowls--skinny fowls, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it was a very cheap wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, indignantly.
<div class="bookquote">``Are kings such monsters that a wish like that must be reckoned a royal
virtue?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wished them a skinny fowl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, <div class="bookquote">``that would not be
nice. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) wished them to have fat fowls.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but the word has dropped out of the text, or perhaps was
subauditum; that is, present in the king's mind, but not uttered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Casaubon, smiling and bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head towards Celia, who
immediately dropped backward a little, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) could not bear Mr.
Casaubon to blink at her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>).

<p/>Dorothea sank into silence on the way back to the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt some
disappointment, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was yet ashamed, that there was nothing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to do in Lowick; and in the next few minutes her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind had
glanced over the possibility, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have preferred, of
finding that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) home would be in a parish which had a larger share of
the world's misery, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have had more active duties in
it. Then, recurring to the future actually before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) made a
picture of more complete devotion to Mr. Casaubon's aims in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
would await new duties. Many such might reveal themselves to the
higher knowledge gained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in that companionship.

<p/>Mr. Tucker soon left them, having some clerical work which would not
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) to lunch at the Hall; and as they were re-entering the garden
through the little gate, Mr. Casaubon said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem a little sad, Dorothea. I trust you are pleased with what
you have seen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>answered
Dorothea, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual openness--<div class="bookquote">``almost wishing that the people
wanted more to be done for them here. I have known so few ways of
making my life good for anything. Of course, my notions of usefulness
must be narrow. I must learn new ways of helping people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon. <div class="bookquote">``Each position has its corresponding
duties. Yours, I trust, as the mistress of Lowick, will not leave any
yearning unfulfilled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I believe that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``Do not suppose
that I am sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is well. But, if you are not tired, we will take another way to
the house than that by which we came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was not at all tired, and a little circuit was made towards a
fine yew-tree, the chief hereditary glory of the grounds on this side
of the house. As they approached it, a figure, conspicuous on a dark
background of evergreens, was seated on a bench, sketching the old
tree. Mr. Brooke, who was walking in front with Celia, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
head, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is that youngster, Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>They had come very near when Mr. Casaubon answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a young relative of mine, a second cousin: the grandson, in
fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) added, looking at Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``of the lady whose portrait you
have been noticing, my aunt Julia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The young man had laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sketch-book and risen. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) bushy
light-brown curls, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) youthfulness, identified him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) at once
with Celia's apparition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, let me introduce to you my cousin, Mr. Ladislaw. Will, this
is Miss Brooke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>The cousin was so close now, that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hat, Dorothea
could see a pair of gray eyes rather near together, a delicate
irregular nose with a little ripple in it, and hair falling backward;
but there was a mouth and chin of a more prominent, threatening aspect
than belonged to the type of the grandmother's miniature. Young
Ladislaw did not feel it necessary to smile, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) were charmed with
this introduction to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) future second cousin and her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) relatives; but
wore rather a pouting air of discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an artist, I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, taking up the sketch-book
and turning it over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) unceremonious fashion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I only sketch a little. There is nothing fit to be seen there,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ladislaw/Young/Young Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said young Ladislaw, coloring, perhaps with temper rather than modesty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, come, this is a nice bit, now. I did a little in this way myself
at one time, you know. Look here, now; this is what I call a nice
thing, done with what we used to call _brio_.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke held out
towards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees,
with a pool.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no judge of these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, not coldly, but with an
eager deprecation of the appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You know, uncle, I never see
the beauty of those pictures which you say are so much praised. They
are a language I do not understand. I suppose there is some relation
between pictures and nature which I am too ignorant to feel--just as
you see what a Greek sentence stands for which means nothing to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea looked up at Mr. Casaubon, who bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
while Mr. Brooke said, smiling nonchalantly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless me, now, how different people are! But you had a bad style of
teaching, you know--else this is just the thing for girls--sketching,
fine art and so on. But you took to drawing plans; you don't
understand morbidezza, and that kind of thing. You will come to my
house, I hope, and I will show you what I did in this way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
continued, turning to young Ladislaw, who had to be recalled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
preoccupation in observing Dorothea. Ladislaw had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mind
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must be an unpleasant girl, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to marry
Casaubon, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) stupidity about pictures would have
confirmed that opinion even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) words for a covert judgment, and was certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
sketch detestable. There was too much cleverness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) apology: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was laughing both at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle and himself. But what a voice! It was
like the voice of a soul that had once lived in an Aeolian harp. This
must be one of Nature's inconsistencies. There could be no sort of
passion in a girl who would marry Casaubon. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),
and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thanks for Mr. Brooke's invitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will turn over my Italian engravings together,''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>continued that
good-natured man. <div class="bookquote">``I have no end of those things, that I have laid by
for years. One gets rusty in this part of the country, you know. Not
you, Casaubon; you stick to your studies; but my best ideas get
undermost--out of use, you know. You clever young men must guard
against indolence. I was too indolent, you know: else I might have
been anywhere at one time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a seasonable admonition,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon; <div class="bookquote">``but now we will
pass on to the house, lest the young ladies should be tired of
standing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>When their backs were turned, young Ladislaw sat down to go on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
sketching, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) did so his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) face broke into an expression of
amusement which increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) went on drawing, till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) threw
back his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) head and laughed aloud. Partly it was the reception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
own artistic production that tickled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>); partly the notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
grave cousin as the lover of that girl; and partly Mr. Brooke's
definition of the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) might have held but for the impediment of
indolence. Mr. Will Ladislaw's sense of the ludicrous lit up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
features very agreeably: it was the pure enjoyment of comicality, and
had no mixture of sneering and self-exaltation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is your nephew going to do with himself, Casaubon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brooke, as they went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My cousin, you mean--not my nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, cousin. But in the way of a career, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The answer to that question is painfully doubtful. On leaving Rugby
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) declined to go to an English university, where I would gladly have
placed him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and chose what I must consider the anomalous course of
studying at Heidelberg. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wants to go abroad again, without
any special object, save the vague purpose of what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) calls culture,
preparation for he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) knows not what. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) declines to choose a profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has no means but what you furnish, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always given him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) friends reason to understand that I
would furnish in moderation what was necessary for providing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with a
scholarly education, and launching him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) respectably. I am-therefore
bound to fulfil the expectation so raised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, putting
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) conduct in the light of mere rectitude: a trait of delicacy which
Dorothea noticed with admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has a thirst for travelling; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may turn out a Bruce or a
Mungo Park,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``I had a notion of that myself at one
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has no bent towards exploration, or the enlargement of our
geognosis: that would be a special purpose which I could recognize with
some approbation, though without felicitating him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) on a career which so
often ends in premature and violent death. But so far is he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from
having any desire for a more accurate knowledge of the earth's surface,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) should prefer not to know the sources of the Nile, and
that there should be some unknown regions preserved as hunting grounds
for the poetic imagination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there is something in that, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, who had
certainly an impartial mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, I fear, nothing more than a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) general inaccuracy and
indisposition to thoroughness of all kinds, which would be a bad augury
for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in any profession, civil or sacred, even were he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) so far
submissive to ordinary rule as to choose one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) has conscientious scruples founded on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own unfitness,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, who was interesting herself in finding a favorable
explanation. <div class="bookquote">``Because the law and medicine should be very serious
professions to undertake, should they not? People's lives and fortunes
depend on them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly
determined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady
application, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful
instrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to
self-indulgent taste. I have insisted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) on what Aristotle has
stated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work
regarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or
acquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience. I have
pointed to my own manuscript volumes, which represent the toil of years
preparatory to a work not yet accomplished. But in vain. To careful
reasoning of this kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) replies by calling himself Pegasus, and every
form of prescribed work `harness.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia laughed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was surprised to find that Mr. Casaubon could say
something quite amusing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) may turn out a Byron, a Chatterton, a
Churchill--that sort of thing--there's no telling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``Shall you let him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) go to Italy, or wherever else he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wants to go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have agreed to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with moderate supplies for a year or
so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) asks no more. I shall let him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) be tried by the test of freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very kind of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, looking up at Mr. Casaubon
with delight. <div class="bookquote">``It is noble. After all, people may really have in them
some vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not?
They may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be
very patient with each other, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is being engaged to be married that has made you think
patience good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) and Dorothea were alone
together, taking off their wrappings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that I am very impatient, Celia.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; when people don't do and say just what you like.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia had
become less afraid of <div class="bookquote">``saying things''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>to Dorothea since this
engagement: cleverness seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more pitiable than ever.



<p/>CHAPTER X.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) had catched a great cold, had he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) had no other clothes
to wear than the skin of a bear not yet killed.'' (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER X.</b></font>)</div>--FULLER.


<p/>Young Ladislaw did not pay that visit to which Mr. Brooke had invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), and only six days afterwards Mr. Casaubon mentioned that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) young
relative had started for the Continent, seeming by this cold vagueness
to waive inquiry. Indeed, Will had declined to fix on any more precise
destination than the entire area of Europe. Genius, he (<font color='blue'><b>Genius</b></font>) held, is
necessarily intolerant of fetters: on the one hand it must have the
utmost play for its spontaneity; on the other, it may confidently await
those messages from the universe which summon it to its peculiar work,
only placing itself in an attitude of receptivity towards all sublime
chances. The attitudes of receptivity are various, and Will had
sincerely tried many of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was not excessively fond of wine, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had several times taken too much, simply as an experiment in that
form of ecstasy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had fasted till he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was faint, and then supped on
lobster; he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had made himself ill with doses of opium. Nothing greatly
original had resulted from these measures; and the effects of the opium
had convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) that there was an entire dissimilarity between his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
constitution and De Quincey's. The superadded circumstance which would
evolve the genius had not yet come; the universe had not yet beckoned.
Even Caesar's fortune at one time was, but a grand presentiment. We
know what a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes
may be disguised in helpless embryos.--In fact, the world is full of
hopeful analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities. Will
saw clearly enough the pitiable instances of long incubation producing
no chick, and but for gratitude would have laughed at Casaubon, whose
plodding application, rows of note-books, and small taper of learned
theory exploring the tossed ruins of the world, seemed to enforce a
moral entirely encouraging to Will's generous reliance on the
intentions of the universe with regard to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) held that
reliance to be a mark of genius; and certainly it is no mark to the
contrary; genius consisting neither in self-conceit nor in humility,
but in a power to make or do, not anything in general, but something in
particular. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) start for the Continent, then, without our
pronouncing on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) future. Among all forms of mistake, prophecy is the
most gratuitous.

<p/>But at present this caution against a too hasty judgment interests me
more in relation to Mr. Casaubon than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) young cousin. If to
Dorothea Mr. Casaubon had been the mere occasion which had set alight
the fine inflammable material of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) youthful illusions, does it follow
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was fairly represented in the minds of those less impassioned
personages who have hitherto delivered their judgments concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)?
I protest against any absolute conclusion, any prejudice derived from
Mrs. Cadwallader's contempt for a neighboring clergyman's alleged
greatness of soul, or Sir James Chettam's poor opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) rival's
legs,--from Mr. Brooke's failure to elicit a companion's ideas, or from
Celia's criticism of a middle-aged scholar's personal appearance. I am
not sure that the greatest man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age, if ever that solitary
superlative existed, could escape these unfavorable reflections of
himself in various small mirrors; and even Milton, looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>)
portrait in a spoon, must submit to have the facial angle of a bumpkin.
Moreover, if Mr. Casaubon, speaking for himself, has rather a chilling
rhetoric, it is not therefore certain that there is no good work or
fine feeling in him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Did not an immortal physicist and interpreter of
hieroglyphs write detestable verses? Has the theory of the solar
system been advanced by graceful manners and conversational tact?
Suppose we turn from outside estimates of a man, to wonder, with keener
interest, what is the report of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own consciousness about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doings
or capacity: with what hindrances he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is carrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daily labors;
what fading of hopes, or what deeper fixity of self-delusion the years
are marking off within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and with what spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrestles against
universal pressure, which will one day be too heavy for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and bring
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to its final pause. Doubtless his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lot is important in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own eyes; and the chief reason that we think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks too large a place
in our consideration must be our want of room for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), since we refer
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the Divine regard with perfect confidence; nay, it is even held
sublime for our neighbor to expect the utmost there, however little he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may have got from us. Mr. Casaubon, too, was the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own
world; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was liable to think that others were providentially made
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and especially to consider them in the light of their fitness
for the author of a <div class="bookquote">``Key to all Mythologies,''  (<font color='red'><b>the author</b></font>)</div>this trait is not quite
alien to us, and, like the other mendicant hopes of mortals, claims
some of our pity.

<p/>Certainly this affair of his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) marriage with Miss Brooke touched him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) more
nearly than it did any one of the persons who have hitherto shown their
disapproval of it, and in the present stage of things I feel more
tenderly towards his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) experience of success than towards the
disappointment of the amiable Sir James. For in truth, as the day
fixed for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) marriage came nearer, Mr. Casaubon did not find his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
spirits rising; nor did the contemplation of that matrimonial garden
scene, where, as all experience showed, the path was to be bordered
with flowers, prove persistently more enchanting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) than the
accustomed vaults where he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) walked taper in hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not confess to
himself, still less could he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) have breathed to another, his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) surprise
that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had won a lovely and noble-hearted girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not won
delight,--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had also regarded as an object to be found by
search. It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) knew all the classical passages implying
the contrary; but knowing classical passages, we find, is a mode of
motion, which explains why they leave so little extra force for their
personal application.

<p/>Poor Mr. Casaubon had imagined that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) long studious bachelorhood had
stored up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) a compound interest of enjoyment, and that large
drafts on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) affections would not fail to be honored; for we all of
us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act
fatally on the strength of them. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was in danger of being
saddened by the very conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) circumstances were unusually
happy: there was nothing external by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could account for a
certain blankness of sensibility which came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) just when his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
expectant gladness should have been most lively, just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) exchanged
the accustomed dulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) Lowick library for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) visits to the
Grange. Here was a weary experience in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was as utterly
condemned to loneliness as in the despair which sometimes threatened
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) while toiling in the morass of authorship without seeming nearer to
the goal. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was that worst loneliness which would shrink from
sympathy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could not but wish that Dorothea should think him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) not
less happy than the world would expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) successful suitor to be; and
in relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) authorship he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) leaned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) young trust and
veneration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) liked to draw forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fresh interest in listening, as
a means of encouragement to himself: in talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) presented all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) performance and intention with the reflected confidence of the
pedagogue, and rid himself for the time of that chilling ideal audience
which crowded his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure
of Tartarean shades.

<p/>For to Dorothea, after that toy-box history of the world adapted to
young ladies which had made the chief part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) education, Mr.
Casaubon's talk about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) great book was full of new vistas; and this
sense of revelation, this surprise of a nearer introduction to Stoics
and Alexandrians, as people who had ideas not totally unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own,
kept in abeyance for the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual eagerness for a binding theory
which could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own life and doctrine into strict connection with
that amazing past, and give the remotest sources of knowledge some
bearing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) actions. That more complete teaching would come--Mr.
Casaubon would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) all that: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking forward to higher
initiation in ideas, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking forward to marriage, and
blending her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dim conceptions of both. It would be a great mistake to
suppose that Dorothea would have cared about any share in Mr.
Casaubon's learning as mere accomplishment; for though opinion in the
neighborhood of Freshitt and Tipton had pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clever, that
epithet would not have described her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to circles in whose more precise
vocabulary cleverness implies mere aptitude for knowing and doing,
apart from character. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eagerness for acquirement lay within
that full current of sympathetic motive in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ideas and impulses
were habitually swept along. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not want to deck herself with
knowledge--to wear it loose from the nerves and blood that fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
action; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had written a book she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must have done it as Saint
Theresa did, under the command of an authority that constrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Theresa</b></font>)
conscience. But something she (<font color='blue'><b>Theresa</b></font>) yearned for by which her (<font color='blue'><b>Theresa</b></font>) life might be
filled with action at once rational and ardent; and since the time was
gone by for guiding visions and spiritual directors, since prayer
heightened yearning but not instruction, what lamp was there but
knowledge? Surely learned men kept the only oil; and who more learned
than Mr. Casaubon?

<p/>Thus in these brief weeks Dorothea's joyous grateful expectation was
unbroken, and however her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lover might occasionally be conscious of
flatness, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could never refer it to any slackening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) affectionate
interest.

<p/>The season was mild enough to encourage the project of extending the
wedding journey as far as Rome, and Mr. Casaubon was anxious for this
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wished to inspect some manuscripts in the Vatican.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I still regret that your sister is not to accompany us,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said one
morning, some time after it had been ascertained that Celia objected to
go, and that Dorothea did not wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) companionship. <div class="bookquote">``You will
have many lonely hours, Dorothea, for I shall be constrained to make
the utmost use of my time during our stay in Rome, and I should feel
more at liberty if you had a companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The words <div class="bookquote">``I should feel more at liberty''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>grated on Dorothea. For the
first time in speaking to Mr. Casaubon she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) colored from annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have misunderstood me very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``if you think I
should not enter into the value of your time--if you think that I
should not willingly give up whatever interfered with your using it to
the best purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very amiable in you, my dear Dorothea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, not
in the least noticing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was hurt; <div class="bookquote">``but if you had a lady as your
companion, I could put you both under the care of a cicerone, and we
could thus achieve two purposes in the same space of time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you will not refer to this again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rather
haughtily. But immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was wrong, and turning
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), adding in a different tone, <div class="bookquote">``Pray
do not be anxious about me. I shall have so much to think of when I am
alone. And Tantripp will be a sufficient companion, just to take care
of me. I could not bear to have Celia: she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) would be miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>It was time to dress. There was to be a dinner-party that day, the
last of the parties which were held at the Grange as proper
preliminaries to the wedding, and Dorothea was glad of a reason for
moving away at once on the sound of the bell, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) needed more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual amount of preparation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was ashamed of being
irritated from some cause she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not define even to herself; for
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had no intention to be untruthful, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reply had not touched
the real hurt within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Mr. Casaubon's words had been quite
reasonable, yet they had brought a vague instantaneous sense of
aloofness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) part.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely I am in a strangely selfish weak state of mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to
herself. <div class="bookquote">``How can I have a husband who is so much above me without
knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) needs me less than I need him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Having convinced herself that Mr. Casaubon was altogether right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) equanimity, and was an agreeable image of serene dignity
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came into the drawing-room in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) silver-gray dress--the
simple lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dark-brown hair parted over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) brow and coiled
massively behind, in keeping with the entire absence from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) manner
and expression of all search after mere effect. Sometimes when
Dorothea was in company, there seemed to be as complete an air of
repose about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been a picture of Santa Barbara looking
out from her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) tower into the clear air; but these intervals of quietude
made the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) speech and emotion the more remarked when some
outward appeal had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) was naturally the subject of many observations this evening, for
the dinner-party was large and rather more miscellaneous as to the male
portion than any which had been held at the Grange since Mr. Brooke's
nieces had resided with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), so that the talking was done in duos and
trios more or less inharmonious. There was the newly elected mayor of
Middlemarch, who happened to be a manufacturer; the philanthropic
banker his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) brother-in-law, who predominated so much in the town that
some called him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) a Methodist, others a hypocrite, according to the
resources of their vocabulary; and there were various professional men.
In fact, Mrs. Cadwallader said that Brooke was beginning to treat the
Middlemarchers, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) preferred the farmers at the tithe-dinner,
who drank her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) health unpretentiously, and were not ashamed of their
grandfathers' furniture. For in that part of the country, before
reform had done its notable part in developing the political
consciousness, there was a clearer distinction of ranks and a dimmer
distinction of parties; so that Mr. Brooke's miscellaneous invitations
seemed to belong to that general laxity which came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) inordinate
travel and habit of taking too much in the form of ideas.

<p/>Already, as Miss Brooke passed out of the dining-room, opportunity was
found for some interjectional <div class="bookquote">``asides.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A fine woman, Miss Brooke! an uncommonly fine woman, by God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Standish, the old lawyer, who had been so long concerned with the
landed gentry that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) had become landed himself, and used that oath in
a deep-mouthed manner as a sort of armorial bearings, stamping the
speech of a man who held a good position.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode, the banker, seemed to be addressed, but that gentleman
disliked coarseness and profanity, and merely bowed. The remark was
taken up by Mr. Chichely, a middle-aged bachelor and coursing
celebrity, who had a complexion something like an Easter egg, a few
hairs carefully arranged, and a carriage implying the consciousness of
a distinguished appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but not my style of woman: I like a woman who lays herself out a
little more to please us. There should be a little filigree about a
woman--something of the coquette. A man likes a sort of challenge.
The more of a dead set she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) makes at you the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some truth in that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish, disposed to be genial.
<div class="bookquote">``And, by God, it's usually the way with them. I suppose it answers
some wise ends: Providence made them so, eh, Bulstrode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be disposed to refer coquetry to another source,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``I should rather refer it to the devil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to be sure, there should be a little devil in a woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Chichely, whose study of the fair sex seemed to have been detrimental
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) theology. <div class="bookquote">``And I like them blond, with a certain gait, and a
swan neck. Between ourselves, the mayor's daughter is more to my taste
than Miss Brooke or Miss Celia either. If I were a marrying man I
should choose Miss Vincy before either of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, make up, make up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish, jocosely; <div class="bookquote">``you see the
middle-aged fellows early the day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Chichely shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) head with much meaning: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) was not going to
incur the certainty of being accepted by the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) would choose.

<p/>The Miss Vincy who had the honor of being Mr. Chichely's ideal was of
course not present; for Mr. Brooke, always objecting to go too far,
would not have chosen that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) nieces should meet the daughter of a
Middlemarch manufacturer, unless it were on a public occasion. The
feminine part of the company included none whom Lady Chettam or Mrs.
Cadwallader could object to; for Mrs. Renfrew, the colonel's widow, was
not only unexceptionable in point of breeding, but also interesting on
the ground of her (<font color='blue'><b>Renfrew</b></font>) complaint, which puzzled the doctors, and seemed
clearly a case wherein the fulness of professional knowledge might need
the supplement of quackery. Lady Chettam, who attributed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) own
remarkable health to home-made bitters united with constant medical
attendance, entered with much exercise of the imagination into Mrs.
Renfrew's account of symptoms, and into the amazing futility in her (<font color='blue'><b>Renfrew</b></font>)
case of all strengthening medicines.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where can all the strength of those medicines go, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowager</b></font>)</div>said the
mild but stately dowager, turning to Mrs. Cadwallader reflectively,
when Mrs. Renfrew's attention was called away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It strengthens the disease,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector's wife, much too
well-born not to be an amateur in medicine. <div class="bookquote">``Everything depends on the
constitution: some people make fat, some blood, and some bile--that's
my view of the matter; and whatever they take is a sort of grist to the
mill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to take medicines that would reduce--reduce the
disease, you know, if you are right, my dear. And I think what you say
is reasonable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly it is reasonable. You have two sorts of potatoes, fed on
the same soil. One of them grows more and more watery--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! like this poor Mrs. Renfrew--that is what I think. Dropsy! There
is no swelling yet--it is inward. I should say she (<font color='blue'><b>Renfrew</b></font>) ought to take
drying medicines, shouldn't you?--or a dry hot-air bath. Many things
might be tried, of a drying nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Renfrew</b></font>) try a certain person's pamphlets,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader in an
undertone, seeing the gentlemen enter. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does not want drying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam, a charming woman, not so quick as to
nullify the pleasure of explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bridegroom--Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has certainly been drying up faster since
the engagement: the flame of passion, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is far from having a good constitution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady
Chettam, with a still deeper undertone. <div class="bookquote">``And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) studies--so very
dry, as you say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, by the side of Sir James, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) looks like a death's head skinned
over for the occasion. Mark my words: in a year from this time that
girl will hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) as an oracle now, and
by-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be at the other extreme. All flightiness!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very shocking! I fear she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is headstrong. But tell me--you know
all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>)--is there anything very bad? What is the truth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The truth? he (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) is as bad as the wrong physic--nasty to take, and sure
to disagree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There could not be anything worse than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam, with
so vivid a conception of the physic that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) seemed to have learned
something exact about Mr. Casaubon's disadvantages. <div class="bookquote">``However, James
will hear nothing against Miss Brooke. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is the mirror of
women still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a generous make-believe of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) likes
little Celia better, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) appreciates him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). I hope you like my
little Celia?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly; she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) is fonder of geraniums, and seems more docile, though
not so fine a figure. But we were talking of physic. Tell me about
this new young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is wonderfully
clever: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) certainly looks it--a fine brow indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is a gentleman. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) talking to Humphrey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) talks well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Mr. Brooke says he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is one of the Lydgates of Northumberland,
really well connected. One does not expect it in a practitioner of
that kind. For my own part, I like a medical man more on a footing
with the servants; they are often all the cleverer. I assure you I
found poor Hicks's judgment unfailing; I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) wrong. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) was
coarse and butcher-like, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) knew my constitution. It was a loss to
me his (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) going off so suddenly. Dear me, what a very animated
conversation Miss Brooke seems to be having with this Mr. Lydgate!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is talking cottages and hospitals with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader, whose ears and power of interpretation were quick. <div class="bookquote">``I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is a sort of philanthropist, so Brooke is sure to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``James,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam when her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) son came near, <div class="bookquote">``bring Mr. Lydgate
and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to me. I want to test him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>The affable dowager declared herself delighted with this opportunity of
making Mr. Lydgate's acquaintance, having heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) success in
treating fever on a new plan.

<p/>Mr. Lydgate had the medical accomplishment of looking perfectly grave
whatever nonsense was talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dark steady eyes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
impressiveness as a listener. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was as little as possible like the
lamented Hicks, especially in a certain careless refinement about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>)
toilet and utterance. Yet Lady Chettam gathered much confidence in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) own constitution as being peculiar,
by admitting that all constitutions might be called peculiar, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>)
did not deny that hers might be more peculiar than others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) did not
approve of a too lowering system, including reckless cupping, nor, on
the other hand, of incessant port wine and bark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I think so''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with an air of so much deference accompanying the insight of agreement,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) formed the most cordial opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hicks</b></font>) talents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite pleased with your protege,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) said to Mr. Brooke before
going away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My protege?--dear me!--who is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This young Lydgate, the new doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) seems to me to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
profession admirably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Lydgate! he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is not my protege, you know; only I knew an uncle of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) who sent me a letter about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). However, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is likely to
be first-rate--has studied in Paris, knew Broussais; has ideas, you
know--wants to raise the profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lydgate has lots of ideas, quite new, about ventilation and diet, that
sort of thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>resumed Mr. Brooke, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had handed out Lady
Chettam, and had returned to be civil to a group of Middlemarchers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang it, do you think that is quite sound?--upsetting The old
treatment, which has made Englishmen what they are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Medical knowledge is at a low ebb among us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, who
spoke in a subdued tone, and had rather a sickly air. <div class="bookquote">``I, for my part,
hail the advent of Mr. Lydgate. I hope to find good reason for
confiding the new hospital to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) management.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Standish, who was not fond of Mr.
Bulstrode; <div class="bookquote">``if you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to try experiments on your hospital
patients, and kill a few people for charity I have no objection. But I
am not going to hand money out of my purse to have experiments tried on
me. I like treatment that has been tested a little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Standish, every dose you take is an experiment-an
experiment, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, nodding towards the lawyer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you talk in that sense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish, with as much
disgust at such non-legal quibbling as a man can well betray towards a
valuable client.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be glad of any treatment that would cure me without reducing
me to a skeleton, like poor Grainger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, the mayor, a
florid man, who would have served for a study of flesh in striking
contrast with the Franciscan tints of Mr. Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``It's an
uncommonly dangerous thing to be left without any padding against the
shafts of disease, as somebody said,--and I think it a very good
expression myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lydgate, of course, was out of hearing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had quitted the party
early, and would have thought it altogether tedious but for the novelty
of certain introductions, especially the introduction to Miss Brooke,
whose youthful bloom, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) approaching marriage to that faded
scholar, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) interest in matters socially useful, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) the
piquancy of an unusual combination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a good creature--that fine girl--but a little too earnest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>)
thought. <div class="bookquote">``It is troublesome to talk to such women. They are always
wanting reasons, yet they are too ignorant to understand the merits of
any question, and usually fall back on their moral sense to settle
things after their own taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Evidently Miss Brooke was not Mr. Lydgate's style of woman any more
than Mr. Chichely's. Considered, indeed, in relation to the latter,
whose mind was matured, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was altogether a mistake, and calculated to
shock his (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young
women to purplefaced bachelors. But Lydgate was less ripe, and might
possibly have experience before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) which would modify his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opinion as
to the most excellent things in woman.

<p/>Miss Brooke, however, was not again seen by either of these gentlemen
under her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) maiden name. Not long after that dinner-party she (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had become
Mrs. Casaubon, and was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) way to Rome.



<p/>CHAPTER XI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But deeds and language such as men do use,
And persons such as comedy would choose,
When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would show an image of the times,
And sport with human follies, not with crimes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--BEN JONSON.


<p/>Lydgate, in fact, was already conscious of being fascinated by a woman
strikingly different from Miss Brooke: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not in the least suppose
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) balance and fallen in love, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had said of
that particular woman, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is grace itself; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is perfectly lovely
and accomplished. That is what a woman ought to be: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to
produce the effect of exquisite music.''  (<font color='red'><b>that woman</b></font>)</div>Plain women he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) regarded as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
did the other severe facts of life, to be faced with philosophy and
investigated by science. But Rosamond Vincy seemed to have the true
melodic charm; and when a man has seen the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have
chosen if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had intended to marry speedily, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remaining a bachelor
will usually depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolution rather than on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Lydgate
believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should not marry for several years: not marry until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road
which was quite ready made. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had seen Miss Vincy above his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) horizon
almost as long as it had taken Mr. Casaubon to become engaged and
married: but this learned gentleman was possessed of a fortune; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had
assembled his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voluminous notes, and had made that sort of reputation
which precedes performance,--often the larger part of a man's fame. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
took a wife, as we have seen, to adorn the remaining quadrant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
course, and be a little moon that would cause hardly a calculable
perturbation. But Lydgate was young, poor, ambitious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
half-century before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) instead of behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had come to
Middlemarch bent on doing many things that were not directly fitted to
make his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fortune or even secure him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a good income. To a man under such
circumstances, taking a wife is something more than a question of
adornment, however highly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may rate this; and Lydgate was disposed to
give it the first place among wifely functions. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) taste, guided
by a single conversation, here was the point on which Miss Brooke would
be found wanting, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) undeniable beauty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) did not
look at things from the proper feminine angle. The society of such
women was about as relaxing as going from your work to teach the second
form, instead of reclining in a paradise with sweet laughs for
bird-notes, and blue eyes for a heaven.

<p/>Certainly nothing at present could seem much less important to Lydgate
than the turn of Miss Brooke's mind, or to Miss Brooke than the
qualities of the woman who had attracted this young surgeon. But any
one watching keenly the stealthy convergence of human lots, sees a slow
preparation of effects from one life on another, which tells like a
calculated irony on the indifference or the frozen stare with which we
look at our unintroduced neighbor. Destiny stands by sarcastic with
our dramatis personae folded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Old provincial society had its share of this subtle movement: had not
only its striking downfalls, its brilliant young professional dandies
who ended by living up an entry with a drab and six children for their
establishment, but also those less marked vicissitudes which are
constantly shifting the boundaries of social intercourse, and begetting
new consciousness of interdependence. Some slipped a little downward,
some got higher footing: people denied aspirates, gained wealth, and
fastidious gentlemen stood for boroughs; some were caught in political
currents, some in ecclesiastical, and perhaps found themselves
surprisingly grouped in consequence; while a few personages or families
that stood with rocky firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly
presenting new aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the
double change of self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish
gradually made fresh threads of connection--gradually, as the old
stocking gave way to the savings-bank, and the worship of the solar
guinea became extinct; while squires and baronets, and even lords who
had once lived blamelessly afar from the civic mind, gathered the
faultiness of closer acquaintanceship. Settlers, too, came from
distant counties, some with an alarming novelty of skill, others with
an offensive advantage in cunning. In fact, much the same sort of
movement and mixture went on in old England as we find in older
Herodotus, who also, in telling what had been, thought it well to take
a woman's lot for his (<font color='blue'><b>squires</b></font>) starting-point; though Io, as a maiden apparently
beguiled by attractive merchandise, was the reverse of Miss Brooke, and
in this respect perhaps bore more resemblance to Rosamond Vincy, who
had excellent taste in costume, with that nymph-like figure and pure
blindness which give the largest range to choice in the flow and color
of drapery. But these things made only part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) charm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was
admitted to be the flower of Mrs. Lemon's school, the chief school in
the county, where the teaching included all that was demanded in the
accomplished female--even to extras, such as the getting in and out of
a carriage. Mrs. Lemon herself had always held up Miss Vincy as an
example: no pupil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lemon</b></font>) said, exceeded that young lady for mental
acquisition and propriety of speech, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Lemon</b></font>) musical execution was
quite exceptional. We cannot help the way in which people speak of us,
and probably if Mrs. Lemon had undertaken to describe Juliet or Imogen,
these heroines would not have seemed poetical. The first vision of
Rosamond would have been enough with most judges to dispel any
prejudice excited by Mrs. Lemon's praise.

<p/>Lydgate could not be long in Middlemarch without having that agreeable
vision, or even without making the acquaintance of the Vincy family;
for though Mr. Peacock, whose practice he (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) had paid something to enter
on, had not been their doctor -LRB-Mrs. Vincy not liking the lowering
system adopted by him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had many patients among their connections
and acquaintances. For who of any consequence in Middlemarch was not
connected or at least acquainted with the Vincys? They were old
manufacturers, and had kept a good house for three generations, in
which there had naturally been much intermarrying with neighbors more
or less decidedly genteel. Mr. Vincy's sister had made a wealthy match
in accepting Mr. Bulstrode, who, however, as a man not born in the
town, and altogether of dimly known origin, was considered to have done
well in uniting himself with a real Middlemarch family; on the other
hand, Mr. Vincy had descended a little, having taken an innkeeper's
daughter. But on this side too there was a cheering sense of money;
for Mrs. Vincy's sister had been second wife to rich old Mr.
Featherstone, and had died childless years ago, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) nephews and
nieces might be supposed to touch the affections of the widower. And
it happened that Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Featherstone, two of Peacock's
most important patients, had, from different causes, given an
especially good reception to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) successor, who had raised some
partisanship as well as discussion. Mr. Wrench, medical attendant to
the Vincy family, very early had grounds for thinking lightly of
Lydgate's professional discretion, and there was no report about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
which was not retailed at the Vincys', where visitors were frequent.
Mr. Vincy was more inclined to general good-fellowship than to taking
sides, but there was no need for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) to be hasty in making any new man
acquaintance. Rosamond silently wished that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father would invite
Mr. Lydgate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was tired of the faces and figures she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had always
been used to--the various irregular profiles and gaits and turns of
phrase distinguishing those Middlemarch young men whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had known as
boys. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been at school with girls of higher position, whose
brothers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt sure, it would have been possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to be more
interested in, than in these inevitable Middlemarch companions. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would not have chosen to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wish to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),
for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part, was in no hurry on the subject. An alderman about to be
mayor must by-and-by enlarge his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) dinner-parties, but at present there
were plenty of guests at his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) well-spread table.

<p/>That table often remained covered with the relics of the family
breakfast long after Mr. Vincy had gone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) second son to the
warehouse, and when Miss Morgan was already far on in morning lessons
with the younger girls in the schoolroom. It awaited the family
laggard, who found any sort of inconvenience -LRB-to others-RRB- less
disagreeable than getting up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was called. This was the case one
morning of the October in which we have lately seen Mr. Casaubon
visiting the Grange; and though the room was a little overheated with
the fire, which had sent the spaniel panting to a remote corner,
Rosamond, for some reason, continued to sit at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) embroidery longer
than usual, now and then giving herself a little shake, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
work on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knee to contemplate it with an air of hesitating weariness.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mamma, who had returned from an excursion to the kitchen, sat on
the other side of the small work-table with an air of more entire
placidity, until, the clock again giving notice that it was going to
strike, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) looked up from the lace-mending which was occupying her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
plump fingers and rang the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knock at Mr. Fred's door again, Pritchard, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pritchard</b></font>) it has struck
half-past ten.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>This was said without any change in the radiant good-humor of Mrs.
Vincy's face, in which forty-five years had delved neither angles nor
parallels; and pushing back her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) pink capstrings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) work rest
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) lap, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) looked admiringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``when Fred comes down I wish you would not let
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) have red herrings. I cannot bear the smell of them all over the
house at this hour of the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you are so hard on your brothers! It is the only fault I
have to find with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but
you are so tetchy with your brothers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not tetchy, mamma: you never hear me speak in an unladylike way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you want to deny them things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brothers are so unpleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you must allow for young men. Be thankful if they have
good hearts. A woman must learn to put up with little things. You
will be married some day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to any one who is like Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't decry your own brother, my dear. Few young men have less
against them, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) couldn't take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) degree--I'm sure I can't
understand why, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) seems to me most clever. And you know yourself
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was thought equal to the best society at college. So particular as
you are, my dear, I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly
young man for a brother. You are always finding fault with Bob because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) is not Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, mamma, only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is Bob.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not
something against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But'' (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>--here Rosamond's face broke into a smile which suddenly revealed
two dimples. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) herself thought unfavorably of these dimples and
smiled little in general society. <div class="bookquote">``But I shall not marry any
Middlemarch young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So it seems, my love, for you have as good as refused the pick of
them; and if there's better to be had, I'm sure there's no girl better
deserves it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, mamma--I wish you would not say, `the pick of them.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what else are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, mamma, it is rather a vulgar expression.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely, my dear; I never was a good speaker. What should I say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best of them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that seems just as plain and common. If I had had time to think,
I should have said, `the most superior young men.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But with your
education you must know.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What must Rosy know, mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fred, who had slid in
unobserved through the half-open door while the ladies were bending
over their work, and now going up to the fire stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) back
towards it, warming the soles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) slippers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether it's right to say `superior young men,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy,
ringing the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there are so many superior teas and sugars now. Superior is
getting to be shopkeepers' slang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you beginning to dislike slang, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with mild
gravity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only the wrong sort. All choice of words is slang. It marks a class.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is correct English: that is not slang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon: correct English is the slang of prigs who write
history and essays. And the strongest slang of all is the slang of
poets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will say anything, Fred, to gain your point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, tell me whether it is slang or poetry to call an ox a
leg-plaiter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can call it poetry if you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha, Miss Rosy, you don't know Homer from slang. I shall invent a new
game; I shall write bits of slang and poetry on slips, and give them to
you to separate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, how amusing it is to hear young people talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Vincy, with cheerful admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you got nothing else for my breakfast, Pritchard?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, to
the servant who brought in coffee and buttered toast; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) walked
round the table surveying the ham, potted beef, and other cold
remnants, with an air of silent rejection, and polite forbearance from
signs of disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should you like eggs, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eggs, no! Bring me a grilled bone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, when the servant had left the room, <div class="bookquote">``if
you must have hot things for breakfast, I wish you would come down
earlier. You can get up at six o'clock to go out hunting; I cannot
understand why you find it so difficult to get up on other mornings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is your want of understanding, Rosy. I can get up to go hunting
because I like it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you think of me if I came down two hours after every one
else and ordered grilled bone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think you were an uncommonly fast young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) toast with the utmost composure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot see why brothers are to make themselves disagreeable, any
more than sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't make myself disagreeable; it is you who find me so.
Disagreeable is a word that describes your feelings and not my actions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it describes the smell of grilled bone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. It describes a sensation in your little nose associated
with certain finicking notions which are the classics of Mrs. Lemon's
school. Look at my mother; you don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) objecting to everything
except what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is my notion of a pleasant woman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you both, my dears, and don't quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, with
motherly cordiality. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Fred, tell us all about the new doctor.
How is your uncle pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) asks Lydgate all sorts of questions and then
screws up his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) face while he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hears the answers, as if they were pinching
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) toes. That's his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) way. Ah, here comes my grilled bone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how came you to stay out so late, my dear? You only said you were
going to your uncle's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dined at Plymdale's. We had whist. Lydgate was there too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is very gentlemanly, I suppose.
They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is of excellent family--his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) relations quite county people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``There was a Lydgate at John's who spent no end of
money. I find this man is a second cousin of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But rich men may
have very poor devils for second cousins.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It always makes a difference, though, to be of good family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, with a tone of decision which showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had thought on
this subject. Rosamond felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might have been happier if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had not been the daughter of a Middlemarch manufacturer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) disliked
anything which reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mother's father had been an
innkeeper. Certainly any one remembering the fact might think that
Mrs. Vincy had the air of a very handsome good-humored landlady,
accustomed to the most capricious orders of gentlemen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it was odd his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron name</b></font>)</div>said the bright-faced
matron, <div class="bookquote">``but of course it's a name in the family. But now, tell us
exactly what sort of man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the matron name</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, tallish, dark, clever--talks well--rather a prig, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never can make out what you mean by a prig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A fellow who wants to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has opinions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear, doctors must have opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy. <div class="bookquote">``What are
they there for else?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, mother, the opinions they are paid for. But a prig is a fellow
who is always making you a present of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) opinions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose Mary Garth admires Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, not without
a touch of innuendo.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I can't say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, rather glumly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) left the table,
and taking up a novel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had brought down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), threw himself
into an arm-chair. <div class="bookquote">``If you are jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), go oftener to Stone
Court yourself and eclipse her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would not be so vulgar, Fred. If you have finished, pray
ring the bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true, though--what your brother says, Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Vincy
began, when the servant had cleared the table. <div class="bookquote">``It is a thousand
pities you haven't patience to go and see your uncle more, so proud of
you as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is, and wanted you to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). There's no knowing what
he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might have done for you as well as for Fred. God knows, I'm fond of
having you at home with me, but I can part with my children for their
good. And now it stands to reason that your uncle Featherstone will do
something for Mary Garth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary Garth can bear being at Stone Court, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) likes that
better than being a governess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, folding up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) work. <div class="bookquote">``I
would rather not have anything left to me if I must earn it by enduring
much of my uncle's cough and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ugly relations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) can't be long for this world, my dear; I wouldn't hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) end,
but what with asthma and that inward complaint, let us hope there is
something better for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in another. And I have no ill-will toward's
Mary Garth, but there's justice to be thought of. And Mr.
Featherstone's first wife brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) no money, as my sister did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
nieces and nephews can't have so much claim as my sister's. And I must
say I think Mary Garth a dreadful plain girl--more fit for a governess.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every one would not agree with you there, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who
seemed to be able to read and listen too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, wheeling skilfully, <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) _had_
some fortune left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),--a man marries his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's relations, and the
Garths are so poor, and live in such a small way. But I shall leave
you to your studies, my dear; for I must go and do some shopping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred's studies are not very deep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, rising with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
mamma, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is only reading a novel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, by-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'ll go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) Latin and things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Vincy, soothingly, stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) son's head. <div class="bookquote">``There's a fire in the
smoking-room on purpose. It's your father's wish, you know--Fred, my
dear--and I always tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) you will be good, and go to college again
to take your degree.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother's hand down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) lips, but said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you are not going out riding to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
lingering a little after her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mamma was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa says I may have the chestnut to ride now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can go with me to-morrow, if you like. Only I am going to Stone
Court, remember.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to ride so much, it is indifferent to me where we go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Rosamond
really wished to go to Stone Court, of all other places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I say, Rosy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was passing out of the room, <div class="bookquote">``if
you are going to the piano, let me come and play some airs with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do not ask me this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, Fred, I wish you would leave off playing the flute. A man
looks very silly playing the flute. And you play so out of tune.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When next any one makes love to you, Miss Rosamond, I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
how obliging you are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you expect me to oblige you by hearing you play the flute,
any more than I should expect you to oblige me by not playing it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why should you expect me to take you out riding?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>This question led to an adjustment, for Rosamond had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind on
that particular ride.

<p/>So Fred was gratified with nearly an hour's practice of <div class="bookquote">``Ar hyd y nos,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ye banks and braes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>and other favorite airs from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Instructor on
the Flute;''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>a wheezy performance, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) threw much ambition and
an irrepressible hopefulness.



<p/>CHAPTER XII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Instructor</b></font>) had more tow on his (<font color='blue'><b>Instructor</b></font>) distaffe
Than Gerveis knew.''
 (<font color='red'><b>CHAUCER</b></font>)</div>--CHAUCER.


<p/>The ride to Stone Court, which Fred and Rosamond took the next morning,
lay through a pretty bit of midland landscape, almost all meadows and
pastures, with hedgerows still allowed to grow in bushy beauty and to
spread out coral fruit for the birds. Little details gave each field a
particular physiognomy, dear to the eyes that have looked on them from
childhood: the pool in the corner where the grasses were dank and trees
leaned whisperingly; the great oak shadowing a bare place in
mid-pasture; the high bank where the ash-trees grew; the sudden slope
of the old marl-pit making a red background for the burdock; the
huddled roofs and ricks of the homestead without a traceable way of
approach; the gray gate and fences against the depths of the bordering
wood; and the stray hovel, its old, old thatch full of mossy hills and
valleys with wondrous modulations of light and shadow such as we travel
far to see in later life, and see larger, but not more beautiful.
These are the things that make the gamut of joy in landscape to
midland-bred souls--the things they toddled among, or perhaps learned
by heart standing between their father's knees while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drove leisurely.

<p/>But the road, even the byroad, was excellent; for Lowick, as we have
seen, was not a parish of muddy lanes and poor tenants; and it was into
Lowick parish that Fred and Rosamond entered after a couple of miles'
riding. Another mile would bring them to Stone Court, and at the end
of the first half, the house was already visible, looking as if it had
been arrested in its growth toward a stone mansion by an unexpected
budding of farm-buildings on its left flank, which had hindered it from
becoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman
farmer. It was not the less agreeable an object in the distance for
the cluster of pinnacled corn-ricks which balanced the fine row of
walnuts on the right.

<p/>Presently it was possible to discern something that might be a gig on
the circular drive before the front door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``I hope none of my uncle's horrible relations
are there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are, though. That is Mrs. Waule's gig--the last yellow gig left,
I should think. When I see Mrs. Waule in it, I understand how yellow
can have been worn for mourning. That gig seems to me more funereal
than a hearse. But then Mrs. Waule always has black crape on. How
does she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) manage it, Rosy? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) friends can't always be dying.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know at all. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) is not in the least evangelical,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, reflectively, as if that religious point of view would have
fully accounted for perpetual crape. <div class="bookquote">``And, not poor,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) added, after
a moment's pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, by George! They are as rich as Jews, those Waules and
Featherstones; I mean, for people like them, who don't want to spend
anything. And yet they hang about my uncle like vultures, and are
afraid of a farthing going away from their side of the family. But I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hates them all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div><p/>The Mrs. Waule who was so far from being admirable in the eyes of these
distant connections, had happened to say this very morning -LRB-not at all
with a defiant air, but in a low, muffled, neutral tone, as of a voice
heard through cotton wool-RRB- that she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) did not wish <div class="bookquote">``to enjoy their good
opinion.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) was seated, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) observed, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) own brother's hearth,
and had been Jane Featherstone five-and-twenty years before she (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had
been Jane Waule, which entitled her (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) to speak when her (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) own brother's
name had been made free with by those who had no right to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you driving at there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
stick between his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) knees and settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) wig, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) a
momentary sharp glance, which seemed to react on him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) like a draught of
cold air and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) coughing.

<p/>Mrs. Waule had to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) answer till he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was quiet again, till Mary
Garth had supplied him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) with fresh syrup, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had begun to rub the
gold knob of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) stick, looking bitterly at the fire. It was a bright
fire, but it made no difference to the chill-looking purplish tint of
Mrs. Waule's face, which was as neutral as her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) voice; having mere
chinks for eyes, and lips that hardly moved in speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctors can't master that cough, brother. It's just like what I
have; for I'm your own sister, constitution and everything. But, as I
was saying, it's a pity Mrs. Vincy's family can't be better conducted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tchah! you said nothing o' the sort. You said somebody had made free
with my name.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no more than can be proved, if what everybody says is true. My
brother Solomon tells me it's the talk up and down in Middlemarch how
unsteady young Vincy is, and has been forever gambling at billiards
since home he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! What's a game at billiards? It's a good gentlemanly game;
and young Vincy is not a clodhopper. If your son John took to
billiards, now, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'d make a fool of himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your nephew John never took to billiards or any other game, brother,
and is far from losing hundreds of pounds, which, if what everybody
says is true, must be found somewhere else than out of Mr. Vincy the
father's pocket. For they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)'s been losing money for years, though
nobody would think so, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) go coursing and keeping open house as
they do. And I've heard say Mr. Bulstrode condemns Mrs. Vincy beyond
anything for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) flightiness, and spoiling her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) children so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's Bulstrode to me? I don't bank with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mrs. Bulstrode is Mr. Vincy's own sister, and they do say that
Mr. Vincy mostly trades on the Bank money; and you may see yourself,
brother, when a woman past forty has pink strings always flying, and
that light way of laughing at everything, it's very unbecoming. But
indulging your children is one thing, and finding money to pay their
debts is another. And it's openly said that young Vincy has raised
money on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) expectations. I don't say what expectations. Miss Garth
hears me, and is welcome to tell again. I know young people hang
together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, Mrs. Waule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary Garth. <div class="bookquote">``I dislike hearing
scandal too much to wish to repeat it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Featherstone rubbed the knob of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) stick and made a brief
convulsive show of laughter, which had much the same genuineness as an
old whist-player's chuckle over a bad hand. Still looking at the fire,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And who pretends to say Fred Vincy hasn't got expectations? Such a
fine, spirited fellow is like enough to have 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a slight pause before Mrs. Waule replied, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) did
so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) voice seemed to be slightly moistened with tears, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>)
face was still dry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether or no, brother, it is naturally painful to me and my brother
Solomon to hear your name made free with, and your complaint being such
as may carry you off sudden, and people who are no more Featherstones
than the Merry-Andrew at the fair, openly reckoning on your property
coming to _them_. And me your own sister, and Solomon your own
brother! And if that's to be it, what has it pleased the Almighty to
make families for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>Here Mrs. Waule's tears fell, but with moderation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, out with it, Jane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You
mean to say, Fred Vincy has been getting somebody to advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) money
on what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) knows about my will, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said so, brother''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mrs. Waule's voice had again become dry and
unshaken-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``It was told me by my brother Solomon last night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)
called coming from market to give me advice about the old wheat, me
being a widow, and my son John only three-and-twenty, though steady
beyond anything. And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had it from most undeniable authority, and not
one, but many.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuff and nonsense! I don't believe a word of it. It's all a got-up

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not got up by me, brother, nor yet by Solomon, who, whatever else he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)
may be--and I don't deny he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) has oddities--has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) will and parted
his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) property equal between such kin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)'s friends with; though, for
my part, I think there are times when some should be considered more
than others. But Solomon makes it no secret what he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) means to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The more fool he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, with some difficulty;
breaking into a severe fit of coughing that required Mary Garth to
stand near him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did not find out whose horses they were
which presently paused stamping on the gravel before the door.

<p/>Before Mr. Featherstone's cough was quiet, Rosamond entered, bearing up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) riding-habit with much grace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) bowed ceremoniously to Mrs.
Waule, who said stiffly, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>smiled and nodded
silently to Mary, and remained standing till the coughing should cease,
and allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Heyday, miss!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``you have a fine color. Where's Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Seeing about the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) will be in presently.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, sit down. Mrs. Waule, you'd better go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>those neighbors</b></font>)</div><p/>Even those neighbors who had called Peter Featherstone an old fox, had
never accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) of being insincerely polite, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) sister was quite
used to the peculiar absence of ceremony with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) sense
of blood-relationship. Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) herself was accustomed to think that
entire freedom from the necessity of behaving agreeably was included in
the Almighty's intentions about families. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rose slowly without any
sign of resentment, and said in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual muffled monotone, <div class="bookquote">``Brother, I
hope the new doctor will be able to do something for you. Solomon says
there's great talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) cleverness. I'm sure it's my wish you should
be spared. And there's none more ready to nurse you than your own
sister and your own nieces, if you'd only say the word. There's
Rebecca, and Joanna, and Elizabeth, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I remember--you'll see I've remembered 'em all--all dark and
ugly. They'd need have some money, eh? There never was any beauty in
the women of our family; but the Featherstones have always had some
money, and the Waules too. Waule had money too. A warm man was Waule.
Ay, ay; money's a good egg; and if you 've got money to leave behind
you, lay it in a warm nest. Good-by, Mrs. Waule.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>Here Mr.
Featherstone pulled at both sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) wig as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) wanted to deafen
himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) sister went away ruminating on this oracular speech of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>). Notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth,
there remained as the nethermost sediment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) mental shallows a
persuasion that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
chief property away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) blood-relations:--else, why had the
Almighty carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) two wives both childless, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) had gained
so much by manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected
it?--and why was there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and
Powderells all sitting in the same pew for generations, and the
Featherstone pew next to them, if, the Sunday after her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) brother Peter's
death, everybody was to know that the property was gone out of the
family? The human mind has at no period accepted a moral chaos; and so
preposterous a result was not strictly conceivable. But we are
frightened at much that is not strictly conceivable.

<p/>When Fred came in the old man eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) with a peculiar twinkle, which
the younger had often had reason to interpret as pride in the
satisfactory details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) appearance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You two misses go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone. <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to
Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come into my room, Rosamond, you will not mind the cold for a little
while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. The two girls had not only known each other in
childhood, but had been at the same provincial school together -LRB-Mary as
an articled pupil-RRB-, so that they had many memories in common, and liked
very well to talk in private. Indeed, this tete-a-tete was one of
Rosamond's objects in coming to Stone Court.

<p/>Old Featherstone would not begin the dialogue till the door had been
closed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) continued to look at Fred with the same twinkle and with
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) habitual grimaces, alternately screwing and widening his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
mouth; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke, it was in a low tone, which might be taken
for that of an informer ready to be bought off, rather than for the
tone of an offended senior. He (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) was not a man to feel any strong moral
indignation even on account of trespasses against himself. It was
natural that others should want to get an advantage over him (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>), but then,
he (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) was a little too cunning for them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So, sir, you've been paying ten per cent for money which you've
promised to pay off by mortgaging my land when I'm dead and gone, eh?
You put my life at a twelvemonth, say. But I can alter my will yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred blushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not borrowed money in that way, for excellent
reasons. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was conscious of having spoken with some confidence
-LRB-perhaps with more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) exactly remembered-RRB- about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) prospect of
getting Featherstone's land as a future means of paying present debts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you refer to, sir. I have certainly never borrowed
any money on such an insecurity. Please do explain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, it's you must explain. I can alter my will yet, let me tell
you. I'm of sound mind--can reckon compound interest in my head, and
remember every fool's name as well as I could twenty years ago. What
the deuce? I'm under eighty. I say, you must contradict this story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have contradicted it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred answered, with a touch of
impatience, not remembering that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle did not verbally
discriminate contradicting from disproving, though no one was further
from confounding the two ideas than old Featherstone, who often
wondered that so many fools took his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) own assertions for proofs. <div class="bookquote">``But I
contradict it again. The story is a silly lie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! you must bring dockiments. It comes from authority.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Name the authority, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) name the man of whom I borrowed the
money, and then I can disprove the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's pretty good authority, I think--a man who knows most of what goes
on in Middlemarch. It's that fine, religious, charitable uncle o'
yours. Come now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Featherstone had his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) peculiar inward shake
which signified merriment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bulstrode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who else, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) named the man
who lent me the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But,
supposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn't get
it--Bulstrode `ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode
to say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't believe you've ever promised to pay your debts out o'
my land. Come now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Featherstone's face required its whole scale of grimaces as a
muscular outlet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) silent triumph in the soundness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) faculties.

<p/>Fred felt himself to be in a disgusting dilemma.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be joking, sir. Mr. Bulstrode, like other men, believes
scores of things that are not true, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has a prejudice against me.
I could easily get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to write that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knew no facts in proof of the
report you speak of, though it might lead to unpleasantness. But I
could hardly ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to write down what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) believes or does not believe
about me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred paused an instant, and then added, in politic appeal to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle's vanity, <div class="bookquote">``That is hardly a thing for a gentleman to ask.''
 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was disappointed in the result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, I know what you mean. You'd sooner offend me than Bulstrode. And
what's he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s got no land hereabout that ever I heard tell of. A
speckilating fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may come down any day, when the devil leaves
off backing him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). And that's what his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) religion means: he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wants God
A'mighty to come in. That's nonsense! There's one thing I made out
pretty clear when I used to go to church--and it's this: God A'mighty
sticks to the land. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promises land, and He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gives land, and He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) makes
chaps rich with corn and cattle. But you take the other side. You
like Bulstrode and speckilation better than Featherstone and land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, rising, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) back to
the fire and beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) boot with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) whip. <div class="bookquote">``I like neither Bulstrode
nor speculation.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke rather sulkily, feeling himself stalemated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, you can do without me, that's pretty clear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said old
Featherstone, secretly disliking the possibility that Fred would show
himself at all independent. <div class="bookquote">``You neither want a bit of land to make a
squire of you instead of a starving parson, nor a lift of a hundred
pound by the way. It's all one to me. I can make five codicils if I
like, and I shall keep my bank-notes for a nest-egg. It's all one to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred colored again. Featherstone had rarely given him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) presents of
money, and at this moment it seemed almost harder to part with the
immediate prospect of bank-notes than with the more distant prospect of
the land.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not ungrateful, sir. I never meant to show disregard for any
kind intentions you might have towards me. On the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. Then prove it. You bring me a letter from Bulstrode
saying he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) doesn't believe you've been cracking and promising to pay
your debts out o' my land, and then, if there's any scrape you've got
into, we'll see if I can't back you a bit. Come now! That's a
bargain. Here, give me your arm. I'll try and walk round the room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) irritation, had kindness enough in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to be a
little sorry for the unloved, unvenerated old man, who with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
dropsical legs looked more than usually pitiable in walking. While
giving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not himself like to be an old
fellow with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) constitution breaking up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited
good-temperedly, first before the window to hear the wonted remarks
about the guinea-fowls and the weather-cock, and then before the scanty
book-shelves, of which the chief glories in dark calf were Josephus,
Culpepper, Klopstock's <div class="bookquote">``Messiah,''  (<font color='red'><b>Culpepper</b></font>)</div>and several volumes of the
<div class="bookquote">``Gentleman's Magazine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Culpepper</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Read me the names o' the books. Come now! you're a college man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the titles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did missy want with more books? What must you be bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>)
more books for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>), sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) is very fond of reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A little too fond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, captiously. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) was for
reading when she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) sat with me. But I put a stop to that. She (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>)'s got the
newspaper to read out loud. That's enough for one day, I should think.
I can't abide to see her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) reading to herself. You mind and not bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) any more books, do you hear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I hear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred had received this order before, and had
secretly disobeyed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) intended to disobey it again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring the bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone; <div class="bookquote">``I want missy to come down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond and Mary had been talking faster than their male friends.
They did not think of sitting down, but stood at the toilet-table near
the window while Rosamond took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hat, adjusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) veil, and
applied little touches of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) finger-tips to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hair--hair of
infantine fairness, neither flaxen nor yellow. Mary Garth seemed all
the plainer standing at an angle between the two nymphs--the one in the
glass, and the one out of it, who looked at each other with eyes of
heavenly blue, deep enough to hold the most exquisite meanings an
ingenious beholder could put into them, and deep enough to hide the
meanings of the owner if these should happen to be less exquisite.
Only a few children in Middlemarch looked blond by the side of
Rosamond, and the slim figure displayed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) riding-habit had
delicate undulations. In fact, most men in Middlemarch, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
brothers, held that Miss Vincy was the best girl in the world, and some
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) an angel. Mary Garth, on the contrary, had the aspect of an
ordinary sinner: she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was brown; her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) curly dark hair was rough and
stubborn; her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) stature was low; and it would not be true to declare, in
satisfactory antithesis, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had all the virtues. Plainness has
its peculiar temptations and vices quite as much as beauty; it is apt
either to feign amiability, or, not feigning it, to show all the
repulsiveness of discontent: at any rate, to be called an ugly thing in
contrast with that lovely creature your companion, is apt to produce
some effect beyond a sense of fine veracity and fitness in the phrase.
At the age of two-and-twenty Mary had certainly not attained that
perfect good sense and good principle which are usually recommended to
the less fortunate girl, as if they were to be obtained in quantities
ready mixed, with a flavor of resignation as required. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shrewdness
had a streak of satiric bitterness continually renewed and never
carried utterly out of sight, except by a strong current of gratitude
towards those who, instead of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ought to be
contented, did something to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so. Advancing womanhood had
tempered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) plainness, which was of a good human sort, such as the
mothers of our race have very commonly worn in all latitudes under a
more or less becoming headgear. Rembrandt would have painted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with
pleasure, and would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broad features look out of the canvas
with intelligent honesty. For honesty, truth-telling fairness, was
Mary's reigning virtue: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neither tried to create illusions, nor
indulged in them for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own behoof, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in a good mood
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had humor enough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to laugh at herself. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Rosamond
happened both to be reflected in the glass, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, laughingly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a brown patch I am by the side of you, Rosy! You are the most
unbecoming companion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! No one thinks of your appearance, you are so sensible and
useful, Mary. Beauty is of very little consequence in reality,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head towards Mary, but with eyes swerving towards
the new view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neck in the glass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean my beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, rather sardonically.

<p/>Rosamond thought, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) takes the kindest things ill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Aloud
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? Oh, minding the house--pouring out syrup--pretending to be amiable
and contented--learning to have a bad opinion of everybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a wretched life for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, curtly, with a little toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``I think my
life is pleasanter than your Miss Morgan's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but Miss Morgan is so uninteresting, and not young.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>) is interesting to herself, I suppose; and I am not at all sure
that everything gets easier as one gets older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, reflectively; <div class="bookquote">``one wonders what such people do,
without any prospect. To be sure, there is religion as a support.
But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) added, dimpling, <div class="bookquote">``it is very different with you, Mary. You
may have an offer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has any one told you he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) means to make me one?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course not. I mean, there is a gentleman who may fall in love with
you, seeing you almost every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>A certain change in Mary's face was chiefly determined by the resolve
not to show any change.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does that always make people fall in love?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered, carelessly;
<div class="bookquote">``it seems to me quite as often a reason for detesting each other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not when they are interesting and agreeable. I hear that Mr. Lydgate
is both.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Lydgate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with an unmistakable lapse into
indifference. <div class="bookquote">``You want to know something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) added, not
choosing to indulge Rosamond's indirectness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely, how you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no question of liking at present. My liking always wants
some little kindness to kindle it. I am not magnanimous enough to like
people who speak to me without seeming to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) so haughty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with heightened satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">``You
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is of good family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not give that as a reason.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary! you are the oddest girl. But what sort of looking man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
Describe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can one describe a man? I can give you an inventory: heavy
eyebrows, dark eyes, a straight nose, thick dark hair, large solid
white hands--and--let me see--oh, an exquisite cambric
pocket-handkerchief. But you will see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You know this is about the
time of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond blushed a little, but said, meditatively, <div class="bookquote">``I rather like a
haughty manner. I cannot endure a rattling young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not tell you that Mr. Lydgate was haughty; but il y en a pour
tous les gouts, as little Mamselle used to say, and if any girl can
choose the particular sort of conceit she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would like, I should think it
is you, Rosy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haughtiness is not conceit; I call Fred conceited.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish no one said any worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should be more careful. Mrs.
Waule has been telling uncle that Fred is very unsteady.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary spoke
from a girlish impulse which got the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) judgment. There was
a vague uneasiness associated with the word <div class="bookquote">``unsteady''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hoped
Rosamond might say something to dissipate. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) purposely abstained
from mentioning Mrs. Waule's more special insinuation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Fred is horrid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would not have allowed
herself so unsuitable a word to any one but Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean by horrid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is so idle, and makes papa so angry, and says he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) will not take

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is quite right, Mary? I thought you had more sense
of religion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not fit to be a clergyman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ought to be fit.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ought to be.
I know some other people who are in the same case.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But no one approves of them. I should not like to marry a clergyman;
but there must be clergymen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It does not follow that Fred must be one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But when papa has been at the expense of educating him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) for it! And

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can suppose that very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, dryly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I wonder you can defend Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, inclined to push
this point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, laughing; <div class="bookquote">``I would defend any parish

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But of course if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) were a clergyman, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) must be different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) would be a great hypocrite; and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is not that yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of no use saying anything to you, Mary. You always take Fred's

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) part?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, lighting up. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would

me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You make me feel very uncomfortable, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
gravest mildness; <div class="bookquote">``I would not tell mamma for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What would you not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do not go into a rage, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, mildly as ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your mamma is afraid that Fred will make me an offer, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that
I would not marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) asked me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not going to do so,
that I am aware. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) certainly never has asked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, you are always so violent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are always so exasperating.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I? What can you blame me for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, blameless people are always the most exasperating. There is the
bell--I think we must go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to quarrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quarrel? Nonsense; we have not quarrelled. If one is not to get into
a rage sometimes, what is the good of being friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I to repeat what you have said?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please. I never say
what I am afraid of having repeated. But let us go down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Lydgate was rather late this morning, but the visitors stayed long
enough to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); for Mr. Featherstone asked Rosamond to sing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) herself was so kind as to propose a second favorite song of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``Flow on, thou shining river'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--after she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had sung <div class="bookquote">``Home, sweet
home''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) detested-RRB-. This hard-headed old Overreach approved of
the sentimental song, as the suitable garnish for girls, and also as
fundamentally fine, sentiment being the right thing for a song.

<p/>Mr. Featherstone was still applauding the last performance, and
assuring missy that her (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) voice was as clear as a blackbird's, when Mr.
Lydgate's horse passed the window.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dull expectation of the usual disagreeable routine with an aged
patient--who can hardly believe that medicine would not <div class="bookquote">``set him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up''  (<font color='red'><b>an patient</b></font>)</div>if
the doctor were only clever enough--added to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) general disbelief in
Middlemarch charms, made a doubly effective background to this vision
of Rosamond, whom old Featherstone made haste ostentatiously to
introduce as his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) niece, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had never thought it worth while to
speak of Mary Garth in that light. Nothing escaped Lydgate in
Rosamond's graceful behavior: how delicately she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) waived the notice
which the old man's want of taste had thrust upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) by a quiet
gravity, not showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) dimples on the wrong occasion, but showing
them afterwards in speaking to Mary, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) addressed herself with
so much good-natured interest, that Lydgate, after quickly examining
Mary more fully than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had done before, saw an adorable kindness in
Rosamond's eyes. But Mary from some cause looked rather out of temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Rosy has been singing me a song--you've nothing to say against
that, eh, doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone. <div class="bookquote">``I like it better than your
physic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has made me forget how the time was going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, rising
to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hat, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had laid aside before singing, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
flower-like head on its white stem was seen in perfection above-her
riding-habit. <div class="bookquote">``Fred, we must really go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own reasons for not being in the
best spirits, and wanted to get away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Vincy is a musician?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes.
-LRB-Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was being looked at. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was by nature an actress of parts
that entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) physique: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) even acted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own character, and
so well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not know it to be precisely her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The best in Middlemarch, I'll be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, <div class="bookquote">``let
the next be who she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) will. Eh, Fred? Speak up for your sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid I'm out of court, sir. My evidence would be good for
nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Middlemarch has not a very high standard, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with
a pretty lightness, going towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) whip, which lay at a distance.

<p/>Lydgate was quick in anticipating her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reached the whip before she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
did, and turned to present it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) bowed and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
of course was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and their eyes met with that peculiar
meeting which is never arrived at by effort, but seems like a sudden
divine clearance of haze. I think Lydgate turned a little paler than
usual, but Rosamond blushed deeply and felt a certain astonishment.
After that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was really anxious to go, and did not know what sort of
stupidity her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) uncle was talking of when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went to shake hands with
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).

<p/>Yet this result, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) took to be a mutual impression, called
falling in love, was just what Rosamond had contemplated beforehand.
Ever since that important new arrival in Middlemarch she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had woven a
little future, of which something like this scene was the necessary
beginning. Strangers, whether wrecked and clinging to a raft, or duly
escorted and accompanied by portmanteaus, have always had a
circumstantial fascination for the virgin mind, against which native
merit has urged itself in vain. And a stranger was absolutely
necessary to Rosamond's social romance, which had always turned on a
lover and bridegroom who was not a Middlemarcher, and who had no
connections at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own: of late, indeed, the construction
seemed to demand that he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) should somehow be related to a baronet. Now
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and the stranger had met, reality proved much more moving than
anticipation, and Rosamond could not doubt that this was the great
epoch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) judged of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own symptoms as those of
awakening love, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) held it still more natural that Mr. Lydgate
should have fallen in love at first sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). These things
happened so often at balls, and why not by the morning light, when the
complexion showed all the better for it? Rosamond, though no older
than Mary, was rather used to being fallen in love with; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) part, had remained indifferent and fastidiously critical towards
both fresh sprig and faded bachelor. And here was Mr. Lydgate suddenly
corresponding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) ideal, being altogether foreign to Middlemarch,
carrying a certain air of distinction congruous with good family, and
possessing connections which offered vistas of that middle-class
heaven, rank; a man of talent, also, whom it would be especially
delightful to enslave: in fact, a man who had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) nature quite
newly, and brought a vivid interest into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life which was better than
any fancied <div class="bookquote">``might-be''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in the habit of opposing to the
actual.

<p/>Thus, in riding home, both the brother and the sister were preoccupied
and inclined to be silent. Rosamond, whose basis for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) structure had
the usual airy slightness, was of remarkably detailed and realistic
imagination when the foundation had been once presupposed; and before
they had ridden a mile she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was far on in the costume and introductions
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wedded life, having determined on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) house in Middlemarch, and
foreseen the visits she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would pay to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's high-bred relatives
at a distance, whose finished manners she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could appropriate as
thoroughly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) school accomplishments, preparing
herself thus for vaguer elevations which might ultimately come. There
was nothing financial, still less sordid, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) previsions: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cared
about what were considered refinements, and not about the money that
was to pay for them.

<p/>Fred's mind, on the other hand, was busy with an anxiety which even his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
ready hopefulness could not immediately quell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) saw no way of
eluding Featherstone's stupid demand without incurring consequences
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) liked less even than the task of fulfilling it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father
was already out of humor with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and would be still more so if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
were the occasion of any additional coolness between his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own family and
the Bulstrodes. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) himself hated having to go and speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
uncle Bulstrode, and perhaps after drinking wine he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had said many
foolish things about Featherstone's property, and these had been
magnified by report. Fred felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) made a wretched figure as a
fellow who bragged about expectations from a queer old miser like
Featherstone, and went to beg for certificates at his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) bidding.
But--those expectations! He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) really had them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) saw no agreeable
alternative if he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) gave them up; besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had lately made a debt
which galled him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) extremely, and old Featherstone had almost bargained
to pay it off. The whole affair was miserably small: his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) debts were
small, even his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) expectations were not anything so very magnificent.
Fred had known men to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would have been ashamed of confessing the
smallness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) scrapes. Such ruminations naturally produced a streak
of misanthropic bitterness. To be born the son of a Middlemarch
manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular, while such
men as Mainwaring and Vyan--certainly life was a poor business, when a
spirited young fellow, with a good appetite for the best of everything,
had so poor an outlook.

<p/>It had not occurred to Fred that the introduction of Bulstrode's name
in the matter was a fiction of old Featherstone's; nor could this have
made any difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) saw plainly enough that the
old man wanted to exercise his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power by tormenting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little, and
also probably to get some satisfaction out of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on unpleasant
terms with Bulstrode. Fred fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) saw to the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
uncle Featherstone's soul, though in reality half what he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) saw there was
no more than the reflex of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) own inclinations. The difficult task of
knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is
chiefly made up of their own wishes.

<p/>Fred's main point of debate with himself was, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should tell
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, or try to get through the affair without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's
knowledge. It was probably Mrs. Waule who had been talking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>);
and if Mary Garth had repeated Mrs. Waule's report to Rosamond, it
would be sure to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, who would as surely question him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said to Rosamond, as they slackened their pace--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosy, did Mary tell you that Mrs. Waule had said anything about me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you were very unsteady.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think that was enough, Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) said no more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary mentioned nothing else. But really, Fred, I think you ought to
be ashamed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, fudge! Don't lecture me. What did Mary say about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not obliged to tell you. You care so very much what Mary says,
and you are too rude to allow me to speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I care what Mary says. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is the best girl I know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should never have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a girl to fall in love with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know what men would fall in love with? Girls never know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At least, Fred, let me advise _you_ not to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not marry you if you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might have waited till I did ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew it would nettle you, Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not have said so if you had not provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Before reaching home, Fred concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would tell the whole
affair as simply as possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, who might perhaps take on
himself the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode.





<p/>BOOK II.




<p/>OLD AND YOUNG.



<p/>CHAPTER XIII.

<p/>1st Gent. How class your man?--as better than the most,
Or, seeming better, worse beneath that cloak?
As saint or knave, pilgrim or hypocrite?
2d Gent. Nay, tell me how you class your wealth of books
The drifted relics of all time.
As well sort them at once by size and livery:
Vellum, tall copies, and the common calf
Will hardly cover more diversity
Than all your labels cunningly devised
To class your unread authors.


<p/>In consequence of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Gent</b></font>) had heard from Fred, Mr. Vincy determined to
speak with Mr. Bulstrode in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) private room at the Bank at half-past
one, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was usually free from other callers. But a visitor had
come in at one o'clock, and Mr. Bulstrode had so much to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>),
that there was little chance of the interview being over in half an
hour. The banker's speech was fluent, but it was also copious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
used up an appreciable amount of time in brief meditative pauses. Do
not imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) sickly aspect to have been of the yellow, black-haired
sort: he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had a pale blond skin, thin gray-besprinkled brown hair,
light-gray eyes, and a large forehead. Loud men called his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) subdued
tone an undertone, and sometimes implied that it was inconsistent with
openness; though there seems to be no reason why a loud man should not
be given to concealment of anything except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own voice, unless it can
be shown that Holy Writ has placed the seat of candor in the lungs.
Mr. Bulstrode had also a deferential bending attitude in listening, and
an apparently fixed attentiveness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes which made those persons
who thought themselves worth hearing infer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was seeking the
utmost improvement from their discourse. Others, who expected to make
no great figure, disliked this kind of moral lantern turned on them.
If you are not proud of your cellar, there is no thrill of satisfaction
in seeing your guest hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) wine-glass to the light and look
judicial. Such joys are reserved for conscious merit. Hence Mr.
Bulstrode's close attention was not agreeable to the publicans and
sinners in Middlemarch; it was attributed by some to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) being a
Pharisee, and by others to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) being Evangelical. Less superficial
reasoners among them wished to know who his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) father and grandfather
were, observing that five-and-twenty years ago nobody had ever heard of
a Bulstrode in Middlemarch. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) present visitor, Lydgate, the
scrutinizing look was a matter of indifference: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) simply formed an
unfavorable opinion of the banker's constitution, and concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
had an eager inward life with little enjoyment of tangible things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be exceedingly obliged if you will look in on me here
occasionally, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>the banker observed, after a brief pause.
<div class="bookquote">``If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable
coadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, there will
be many questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the
new hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider what you have
said about the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The
decision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the
land and timber for the building, he (<font color='blue'><b>Medlicote</b></font>) is not disposed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Medlicote</b></font>)
personal attention to the object.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are few things better worth the pains in a provincial town like
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``A fine fever hospital in addition to the old
infirmary might be the nucleus of a medical school here, when once we
get our medical reforms; and what would do more for medical education
than the spread of such schools over the country? A born provincial
man who has a grain of public spirit as well as a few ideas, should do
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can to resist the rush of everything that is a little better
than common towards London. Any valid professional aims may often find
a freer, if not a richer field, in the provinces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>One of Lydgate's gifts was a voice habitually deep and sonorous, yet
capable of becoming very low and gentle at the right moment. About his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
ordinary bearing there was a certain fling, a fearless expectation of
success, a confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own powers and integrity much fortified by
contempt for petty obstacles or seductions of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had had no
experience. But this proud openness was made lovable by an expression
of unaffected good-will. Mr. Bulstrode perhaps liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) the better for
the difference between them in pitch and manners; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) certainly liked
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) the better, as Rosamond did, for being a stranger in Middlemarch.
One can begin so many things with a new person!--even begin to be a
better man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall rejoice to furnish your zeal with fuller opportunities,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Bulstrode answered; <div class="bookquote">``I mean, by confiding to you the superintendence of
my new hospital, should a maturer knowledge favor that issue, for I am
determined that so great an object shall not be shackled by our two
physicians. Indeed, I am encouraged to consider your advent to this
town as a gracious indication that a more manifest blessing is now to
be awarded to my efforts, which have hitherto been much with stood.
With regard to the old infirmary, we have gained the initial point--I
mean your election. And now I hope you will not shrink from incurring
a certain amount of jealousy and dislike from your professional
brethren by presenting yourself as a reformer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not profess bravery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but I acknowledge
a good deal of pleasure in fighting, and I should not care for my
profession, if I did not believe that better methods were to be found
and enforced there as well as everywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The standard of that profession is low in Middlemarch, my dear sir,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the banker. <div class="bookquote">``I mean in knowledge and skill; not in social status,
for our medical men are most of them connected with respectable
townspeople here. My own imperfect health has induced me to give some
attention to those palliative resources which the divine mercy has
placed within our reach. I have consulted eminent men in the
metropolis, and I am painfully aware of the backwardness under which
medical treatment labors in our provincial districts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes;--with our present medical rules and education, one must be
satisfied now and then to meet with a fair practitioner. As to all the
higher questions which determine the starting-point of a diagnosis--as
to the philosophy of medical evidence--any glimmering of these can only
come from a scientific culture of which country practitioners have
usually no more notion than the man in the moon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode, bending and looking intently, found the form which
Lydgate had given to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) agreement not quite suited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
comprehension. Under such circumstances a judicious man changes the
topic and enters on ground where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own gifts may be more useful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the peculiar bias of medical ability is
towards material means. Nevertheless, Mr. Lydgate, I hope we shall not
vary in sentiment as to a measure in which you are not likely to be
actively concerned, but in which your sympathetic concurrence may be an
aid to me. You recognize, I hope; the existence of spiritual interests
in your patients?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I do. But those words are apt to cover different meanings
to different minds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely. And on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no
teaching. Now a point which I have much at heart to secure is a new
regulation as to clerical attendance at the old infirmary. The
building stands in Mr. Farebrother's parish. You know Mr. Farebrother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) vote. I must call to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
seems a very bright pleasant little fellow. And I understand he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is a
naturalist.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Farebrother, my dear sir, is a man deeply painful to contemplate.
I suppose there is not a clergyman in this country who has greater
talents.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bulstrode paused and looked meditative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet been pained by finding any excessive talent in
Middlemarch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, bluntly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I desire,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bulstrode continued, looking still more serious,
<div class="bookquote">``is that Mr. Farebrother's attendance at the hospital should be
superseded by the appointment of a chaplain--of Mr. Tyke, in fact--and
that no other spiritual aid should be called in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As a medical man I could have no opinion on such a point unless I knew
Mr. Tyke, and even then I should require to know the cases in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>)
was applied.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate smiled, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was bent on being circumspect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you cannot enter fully into the merits of this measure at
present. But'' (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Bulstrode began to speak with a more chiselled
emphasis--<div class="bookquote">``the subject is likely to be referred to the medical board of
the infirmary, and what I trust I may ask of you is, that in virtue of
the cooperation between us which I now look forward to, you will not,
so far as you are concerned, be influenced by my opponents in this
matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``The path I have chosen is to work well in my own profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My responsibility, Mr. Lydgate, is of a broader kind. With me,
indeed, this question is one of sacred accountableness; whereas with my
opponents, I have good reason to say that it is an occasion for
gratifying a spirit of worldly opposition. But I shall not therefore
drop one iota of my convictions, or cease to identify myself with that
truth which an evil generation hates. I have devoted myself to this
object of hospital-improvement, but I will boldly confess to you, Mr.
Lydgate, that I should have no interest in hospitals if I believed that
nothing more was concerned therein than the cure of mortal diseases. I
have another ground of action, and in the face of persecution I will
not conceal it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode's voice had become a loud and agitated whisper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said
the last words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There we certainly differ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not sorry that
the door was now opened, and Mr. Vincy was announced. That florid
sociable personage was become more interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had seen
Rosamond. Not that, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had been weaving any future in which
their lots were united; but a man naturally remembers a charming girl
with pleasure, and is willing to dine where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again.
Before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took leave, Mr. Vincy had given that invitation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had
been <div class="bookquote">``in no hurry about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for Rosamond at breakfast had mentioned that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) uncle Featherstone had taken the new doctor into great
favor.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode, alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother-in-law, poured himself out a
glass of water, and opened a sandwich-box.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot persuade you to adopt my regimen, Vincy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I've no opinion of that system. Life wants padding,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Vincy, unable to omit his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) portable theory. <div class="bookquote">``However,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) went on,
accenting the word, as if to dismiss all irrelevance, <div class="bookquote">``what I came here
to talk about was a little affair of my young scapegrace, Fred's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a subject on which you and I are likely to take quite as
different views as on diet, Vincy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope not this time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr. Vincy was resolved to be good-humored.-RRB-
<div class="bookquote">``The fact is, it's about a whim of old Featherstone's. Somebody has
been cooking up a story out of spite, and telling it to the old man, to
try to set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) against Fred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'s very fond of Fred, and is likely to
do something handsome for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>); indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has as good as told Fred that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) means to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) land, and that makes other people jealous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vincy, I must repeat, that you will not get any concurrence from me as
to the course you have pursued with your eldest son. It was entirely
from worldly vanity that you destined him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for the Church: with a family
of three sons and four daughters, you were not warranted in devoting
money to an expensive education which has succeeded in nothing but in
giving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) extravagant idle habits. You are now reaping the
consequences.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>To point out other people's errors was a duty that Mr. Bulstrode rarely
shrank from, but Mr. Vincy was not equally prepared to be patient.
When a man has the immediate prospect of being mayor, and is ready, in
the interests of commerce, to take up a firm attitude on politics
generally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) has naturally a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) importance to the framework
of things which seems to throw questions of private conduct into the
background. And this particular reproof irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) more than any
other. It was eminently superfluous to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) to be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was
reaping the consequences. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) neck under Bulstrode's yoke;
and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) usually enjoyed kicking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was anxious to refrain from
that relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to that, Bulstrode, it's no use going back. I'm not one of your
pattern men, and I don't pretend to be. I couldn't foresee everything
in the trade; there wasn't a finer business in Middlemarch than ours,
and the lad was clever. My poor brother was in the Church, and would
have done well--had got preferment already, but that stomach fever took
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) off: else he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have been a dean by this time. I think I was
justified in what I tried to do for Fred. If you come to religion, it
seems to me a man shouldn't want to carve out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meat to an ounce
beforehand:--one must trust a little to Providence and be generous.
It's a good British feeling to try and raise your family a little: in
my opinion, it's a father's duty to give his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sons a fine chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to act otherwise than as your best friend, Vincy, when I
say that what you have been uttering just now is one mass of
worldliness and inconsistent folly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, kicking in spite of resolutions, <div class="bookquote">``I never
professed to be anything but worldly; and, what's more, I don't see
anybody else who is not worldly. I suppose you don't conduct business
on what you call unworldly principles. The only difference I see is
that one worldliness is a little bit honester than another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This kind of discussion is unfruitful, Vincy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode,
who, finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sandwich, had thrown himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) chair, and
shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes as if weary. <div class="bookquote">``You had some more particular business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes. The long and short of it is, somebody has told old
Featherstone, giving you as the authority, that Fred has been borrowing
or trying to borrow money on the prospect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) land. Of course you
never said any such nonsense. But the old fellow will insist on it
that Fred should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a denial in your handwriting; that is, just
a bit of a note saying you don't believe a word of such stuff, either
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) having borrowed or tried to borrow in such a fool's way. I
suppose you can have no objection to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me. I have an objection. I am by no means sure that your son,
in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) recklessness and ignorance--I will use no severer word--has not
tried to raise money by holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) future prospects, or even that
some one may not have been foolish enough to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on so vague a
presumption: there is plenty of such lax money-lending as of other
folly in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Fred gives me his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) honor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has never borrowed money on the
pretence of any understanding about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle's land. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not a
liar. I don't want to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is. I have blown him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) up
well--nobody can say I wink at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) does. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not a liar.
And I should have thought--but I may be wrong--that there was no
religion to hinder a man from believing the best of a young fellow,
when you don't know worse. It seems to me it would be a poor sort of
religion to put a spoke in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wheel by refusing to say you don't
believe such harm of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) as you've got no good reason to believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all sure that I should be befriending your son by
smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way to the future possession of Featherstone's property.
I cannot regard wealth as a blessing to those who use it simply as a
harvest for this world. You do not like to hear these things, Vincy,
but on this occasion I feel called upon to tell you that I have no
motive for furthering such a disposition of property as that which you
refer to. I do not shrink from saying that it will not tend to your
son's eternal welfare or to the glory of God. Why then should you
expect me to pen this kind of affidavit, which has no object but to
keep up a foolish partiality and secure a foolish bequest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean to hinder everybody from having money but saints and
evangelists, you must give up some profitable partnerships, that's all
I can say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vincy burst out very bluntly. <div class="bookquote">``It may be for the glory
of God, but it is not for the glory of the Middlemarch trade, that
Plymdale's house uses those blue and green dyes it gets from the
Brassing manufactory; they rot the silk, that's all I know about it.
Perhaps if other people knew so much of the profit went to the glory of
God, they might like it better. But I don't mind so much about that--I
could get up a pretty row, if I chose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode paused a little before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``You pain me very
much by speaking in this way, Vincy. I do not expect you to understand
my grounds of action--it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for
principles in the intricacies of the world--still less to make the
thread clear for the careless and the scoffing. You must remember, if
you please, that I stretch my tolerance towards you as my wife's
brother, and that it little becomes you to complain of me as
withholding material help towards the worldly position of your family.
I must remind you that it is not your own prudence or judgment that has
enabled you to keep your place in the trade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely not; but you have been no loser by my trade yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Vincy, thoroughly nettled -LRB-a result which was seldom much retarded by
previous resolutions-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">``And when you married Harriet, I don't see how
you could expect that our families should not hang by the same nail.
If you've changed your mind, and want my family to come down in the
world, you'd better say so. I've never changed; I'm a plain Churchman
now, just as I used to be before doctrines came up. I take the world
as I find it, in trade and everything else. I'm contented to be no
worse than my neighbors. But if you want us to come down in the world,
say so. I shall know better what to do then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk unreasonably. Shall you come down in the world for want of
this letter about your son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, whether or not, I consider it very unhandsome of you to refuse
it. Such doings may be lined with religion, but outside they have a
nasty, dog-in-the-manger look. You might as well slander Fred: it
comes pretty near to it when you refuse to say you didn't set a slander
going. It's this sort of thing--this tyrannical spirit, wanting to
play bishop and banker everywhere--it's this sort of thing makes a
man's name stink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Vincy, if you insist on quarrelling with me, it will be exceedingly
painful to Harriet as well as myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, with a
trifle more eagerness and paleness than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to quarrel. It's for my interest--and perhaps for yours
too--that we should be friends. I bear you no grudge; I think no worse
of you than I do of other people. A man who half starves himself, and
goes the length in family prayers, and so on, that you do, believes in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) religion whatever it may be: you could turn over your capital just
as fast with cursing and swearing:--plenty of fellows do. You like to
be master, there's no denying that; you must be first chop in heaven,
else you won't like it much. But you're my sister's husband, and we
ought to stick together; and if I know Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'ll consider it your
fault if we quarrel because you strain at a gnat in this way, and
refuse to do Fred a good turn. And I don't mean to say I shall bear it
well. I consider it unhandsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vincy rose, began to button his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) great-coat, and looked steadily at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) brother-in-law, meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer.

<p/>This was not the first time that Mr. Bulstrode had begun by admonishing
Mr. Vincy, and had ended by seeing a very unsatisfactory reflection of
himself in the coarse unflattering mirror which that manufacturer's
mind presented to the subtler lights and shadows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) fellow-men; and
perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) experience ought to have warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) how the scene would
end. But a full-fed fountain will be generous with its waters even in
the rain, when they are worse than useless; and a fine fount of
admonition is apt to be equally irrepressible.

<p/>It was not in Mr. Bulstrode's nature to comply directly in consequence
of uncomfortable suggestions. Before changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) always
needed to shape his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) motives and bring them into accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
habitual standard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, at last--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will reflect a little, Vincy. I will mention the subject to
Harriet. I shall probably send you a letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. As soon as you can, please. I hope it will all be settled
before I see you to-morrow.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Follows here the strict receipt
For that sauce to dainty meat,
Named Idleness, which many eat
By preference, and call it sweet:
First watch for morsels, like a hound
Mix well with buffets, stir them round
With good thick oil of flatteries,
And froth with mean self-lauding lies.
Serve warm: the vessels you must choose
To keep it in are dead men's shoes.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode's consultation of Harriet seemed to have had the effect
desired by Mr. Vincy, for early the next morning a letter came which
Fred could carry to Mr. Featherstone as the required testimony.

<p/>The old gentleman was staying in bed on account of the cold weather,
and as Mary Garth was not to be seen in the sitting-room, Fred went
up-stairs immediately and presented the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle, who,
propped up comfortably on a bed-rest, was not less able than usual to
enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating
mankind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spectacles to read the letter, pursing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
lips and drawing down their corners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Under the circumstances I will not decline to state my
conviction--tchah! what fine words the fellow puts! He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s as fine as an
auctioneer--that your son Frederic has not obtained any advance of
money on bequests promised by Mr. Featherstone--promised? who said I
had ever promised? I promise nothing--I shall make codicils as long as
I like--and that considering the nature of such a proceeding, it is
unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would
attempt it--ah, but the gentleman doesn't say you are a young man of
sense and character, mark you that, sir!--As to my own concern with any
report of such a nature, I distinctly affirm that I never made any
statement to the effect that your son had borrowed money on any
property that might accrue to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on Mr. Featherstone's demise--bless
my heart! `property'--accrue--demise! Lawyer Standish is nothing to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) couldn't speak finer if he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) wanted to borrow. Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Featherstone here looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) spectacles at Fred, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) handed
back the letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) with a contemptuous gesture, <div class="bookquote">``you don't suppose
I believe a thing because Bulstrode writes it out fine, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred colored. <div class="bookquote">``You wished to have the letter, sir. I should think it
very likely that Mr. Bulstrode's denial is as good as the authority
which told you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) denies.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Every bit. I never said I believed either one or the other. And now
what d' you expect?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, curtly, keeping on his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
spectacles, but withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) wraps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect nothing, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred with difficulty restrained himself from
venting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) irritation. <div class="bookquote">``I came to bring you the letter. If you like
I will bid you good morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, not yet. Ring the bell; I want missy to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a servant who came in answer to the bell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell missy to come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``What
business had she (<font color='blue'><b>missy</b></font>) to go away?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) spoke in the same tone when Mary came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why couldn't you sit still here till I told you to go? I want my
waistcoat now. I told you always to put it on the bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's eyes looked rather red, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been crying. It was clear
that Mr. Featherstone was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) most snappish humors this
morning, and though Fred had now the prospect of receiving the
much-needed present of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would have preferred being free to
turn round on the old tyrant and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) that Mary Garth was too good
to be at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) beck. Though Fred had risen as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) entered the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
had barely noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and looked as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) nerves were quivering with
the expectation that something would be thrown at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) never
had anything worse than words to dread. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) went to reach the
waistcoat from a peg, Fred went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Allow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let it alone! You bring it, missy, and lay it down here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Featherstone. <div class="bookquote">``Now you go away again till I call you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) added, when
the waistcoat was laid down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>). It was usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) to season
his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) pleasure in showing favor to one person by being especially
disagreeable to another, and Mary was always at hand to furnish the
condiment. When his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) own relatives came she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was treated better. Slowly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) took out a bunch of keys from the waistcoat pocket, and slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
drew forth a tin box which was under the bed-clothes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You expect I am going to give you a little fortune, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) said,
looking above his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) spectacles and pausing in the act of opening the lid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir. You were good enough to speak of making me a present
the other day, else, of course, I should not have thought of the
matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>But Fred was of a hopeful disposition, and a vision had
presented itself of a sum just large enough to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) from a
certain anxiety. When Fred got into debt, it always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
highly probable that something or other--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did not necessarily
conceive what--would come to pass enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to pay in due time. And
now that the providential occurrence was apparently close at hand, it
would have been sheer absurdity to think that the supply would be short
of the need: as absurd as a faith that believed in half a miracle for
want of strength to believe in a whole one.

<p/>The deep-veined hands fingered many bank-notes-one after the other,
laying them down flat again, while Fred leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) chair,
scorning to look eager. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) held himself to be a gentleman at heart,
and did not like courting an old fellow for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) money. At last, Mr.
Featherstone eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) again over his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) spectacles and presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) with
a little sheaf of notes: Fred could see distinctly that there were but
five, as the less significant edges gaped towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). But then, each
might mean fifty pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) took them, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and was going to roll them up
without seeming to think of their value. But this did not suit Mr.
Featherstone, who was eying him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) intently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, don't you think it worth your while to count 'em? You take
money like a lord; I suppose you lose it like one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I was not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, sir. But I
shall be very happy to count them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred was not so happy, however, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had counted them. For they
actually presented the absurdity of being less than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hopefulness had
decided that they must be. What can the fitness of things mean, if not
their fitness to a man's expectations? Failing this, absurdity and
atheism gape behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The collapse for Fred was severe when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) held no more than five twenties, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) share in the
higher education of this country did not seem to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).
Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, with rapid changes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) fair complexion--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very handsome of you, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, locking his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) box and
replacing it, then taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) spectacles deliberately, and at
length, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) inward meditation had more deeply convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>),
repeating, <div class="bookquote">``I should think it handsome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you, sir, I am very grateful,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who had had time to
recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) cheerful air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you ought to be. You want to cut a figure in the world, and I
reckon Peter Featherstone is the only one you've got to trust to.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Here
the old man's eyes gleamed with a curiously mingled satisfaction in the
consciousness that this smart young fellow relied upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and that
the smart young fellow was rather a fool for doing so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed: I was not born to very splendid chances. Few men have
been more cramped than I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with some sense of
surprise at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own virtue, considering how hardly he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was dealt with.
<div class="bookquote">``It really seems a little too bad to have to ride a broken-winded
hunter, and see men, who, are not half such good judges as yourself,
able to throw away any amount of money on buying bad bargains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you can buy yourself a fine hunter now. Eighty pound is enough
for that, I reckon--and you'll have twenty pound over to get yourself
out of any little scrape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Featherstone, chuckling slightly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with a fine sense of contrast
between the words and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, rather a better uncle than your fine uncle Bulstrode. You won't
get much out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spekilations, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)'s got a pretty strong
string round your father's leg, by what I hear, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father never tells me anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affairs, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shows some sense there. But other people find 'em out
without his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) telling. _He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll_ never have much to leave you: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll
most-like die without a will--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s the sort of man to do it--let 'em
make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mayor of Middlemarch as much as they like. But you won't get
much by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dying without a will, though you _are_ the eldest son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred thought that Mr. Featherstone had never been so disagreeable
before. True, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had never before given him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) quite so much money at
once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I destroy this letter of Mr. Bulstrode's, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
rising with the letter as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would put it in the fire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I don't want it. It's worth no money to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred carried the letter to the fire, and thrust the poker through it
with much zest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) longed to get out of the room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was a little
ashamed before his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) inner self, as well as before his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle, to run away
immediately after pocketing the money. Presently, the farm-bailiff
came up to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) master a report, and Fred, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) unspeakable
relief, was dismissed with the injunction to come again soon.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had longed not only to be set free from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle, but also to find
Mary Garth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was now in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) usual place by the fire, with sewing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) hands and a book open on the little table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) eyelids
had lost some of their redness now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) usual air of
self-command.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I wanted up-stairs?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) said, half rising as Fred entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am only dismissed, because Simmons is gone up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary sat down again, and resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was certainly treating
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) with more indifference than usual: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not know how
affectionately indignant he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had felt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) behalf up-stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I stay here a little, Mary, or shall I bore you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary; <div class="bookquote">``you will not be so heavy a bore as Mr.
John Waule, who was here yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sat down without asking my
leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow! I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is in love with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware of it. And to me it is one of the most odious things
in a girl's life, that there must always be some supposition of falling
in love coming between her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and any man who is kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and to whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is grateful. I should have thought that I, at least, might have
been safe from all that. I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity
of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary did not mean to betray any feeling, but in spite of herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
ended in a tremulous tone of vexation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound John Waule! I did not mean to make you angry. I didn't know
you had any reason for being grateful to me. I forgot what a great
service you think it if any one snuffs a candle for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred also had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pride, and was not going to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knew what had called forth
this outburst of Mary's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I am not angry, except with the ways of the world. I do like to
be spoken to as if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I
could understand a little more than I ever hear even from young
gentlemen who have been to college.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary had recovered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke
with a suppressed rippling under-current of laughter pleasant to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't care how merry you are at my expense this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
<div class="bookquote">``I thought you looked so sad when you came up-stairs. It is a shame you
should stay here to be bullied in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I have an easy life--by comparison. I have tried being a teacher,
and I am not fit for that: my mind is too fond of wandering on its own
way. I think any hardship is better than pretending to do what one is
paid for, and never really doing it. Everything here I can do as well
as any one else could; perhaps better than some--Rosy, for example.
Though she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is just the sort of beautiful creature that is imprisoned
with ogres in fairy tales.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Rosy!_''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Fred!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, emphatically; <div class="bookquote">``you have no right to be so
critical.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean anything particular--just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I mean something general--always.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that I am idle and extravagant. Well, I am not fit to be a poor
man. I should not have made a bad fellow if I had been rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have done your duty in that state of life to which it has
not pleased God to call you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I couldn't do my duty as a clergyman, any more than you could do
yours as a governess. You ought to have a little fellow-feeling there,
Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never said you ought to be a clergyman. There are other sorts of
work. It seems to me very miserable not to resolve on some course and
act accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I could, if--''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred broke off, and stood up, leaning against the
mantel-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were sure you should not have a fortune?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say that. You want to quarrel with me. It is too bad of
you to be guided by what other people say about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I want to quarrel with you? I should be quarrelling with all
my new books,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, lifting the volume on the table. <div class="bookquote">``However
naughty you may be to other people, you are good to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I like you better than any one else. But I know you despise
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do--a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, nodding, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would admire a stupendous fellow, who would have wise opinions
about everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I should.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary was sewing swiftly, and seemed provokingly
mistress of the situation. When a conversation has taken a wrong turn
for us, we only get farther and farther into the swamp of awkwardness.
This was what Fred Vincy felt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose a woman is never in love with any one she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has always

some new fellow who strikes a girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mouth curling archly; <div class="bookquote">``I
must go back on my experience. There is Juliet--she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) seems an example
of what you say. But then Ophelia had probably known Hamlet a long
while; and Brenda Troil--she (<font color='blue'><b>Brenda</b></font>) had known Mordaunt Merton ever since they
were children; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Merton</b></font>) seems to have been an estimable young man;
and Minna was still more deeply in love with Cleveland, who was a
stranger. Waverley was new to Flora MacIvor; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) did not fall
in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). And there are Olivia and Sophia Primrose, and
Corinne--they may be said to have fallen in love with new men.
Altogether, my experience is rather mixed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary looked up with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was
very dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), though the eyes were nothing more than clear windows
where observation sat laughingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was certainly an affectionate
fellow, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had grown from boy to man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had grown in love with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of
the country which had exalted his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) views of rank and income.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rose; <div class="bookquote">``if you will not give

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not give you any encouragement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, reddening. <div class="bookquote">``Your
friends would dislike it, and so would mine. My father would think it
a disgrace to me if I accepted a man who got into debt, and would not
work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred was stung, and released her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) walked to the door, but
there she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turned and said: <div class="bookquote">``Fred, you have always been so good, so
generous to me. I am not ungrateful. But never speak to me in that
way again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, sulkily, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hat and whip. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
complexion showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a
plucked idle young gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was thoroughly in love, and with a
plain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone's land in
the background, and a persuasion that, let Mary say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
really did care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), Fred was not utterly in despair.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) got home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave four of the twenties to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother, asking
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to keep them for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to spend that money, mother.
I want it to pay a debt with. So keep it safe away from my fingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) doted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) eldest son and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) youngest girl -LRB-a child of six-RRB-, whom others thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) two
naughtiest children. The mother's eyes are not always deceived in
their partiality: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at least can best judge who is the tender,
filial-hearted child. And Fred was certainly very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother.
Perhaps it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) fondness for another person also that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
particularly anxious to take some security against his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own liability to
spend the hundred pounds. For the creditor to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) owed a hundred
and sixty held a firmer security in the shape of a bill signed by
Mary's father.

Through new haunts of pleasure;
Footprints here and echoes there
Guide me to my treasure:

Wrought to mortal stature,
Fresh as starlight's aged truth--
Many-named Nature!''


 (<font color='red'><b>A historian</b></font>)</div><p/>A great historian, as he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) insisted on calling himself, who had the
happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>)
place among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is
observed to walk under, glories in his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) copious remarks and digressions
as the least imitable part of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) work, and especially in those initial
chapters to the successive books of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) history, where he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) seems to
bring his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty
ease of his (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) fine English. But Fielding lived when the days were longer
-LRB-for time, like money, is measured by our needs-RRB-, when summer
afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter
evenings. We belated historians must not linger after his (<font color='blue'><b>Fielding</b></font>) example; and
if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as
if delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so
much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were
woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be
concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that
tempting range of relevancies called the universe.

<p/>At present I have to make the new settler Lydgate better known to any
one interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could possibly be even to those who had
seen the most of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) since his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arrival in Middlemarch. For surely all
must admit that a man may be puffed and belauded, envied, ridiculed,
counted upon as a tool and fallen in love with, or at least selected as
a future husband, and yet remain virtually unknown--known merely as a
cluster of signs for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) neighbors' false suppositions. There was a
general impression, however, that Lydgate was not altogether a common
country doctor, and in Middlemarch at that time such an impression was
significant of great things being expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). For everybody's
family doctor was remarkably clever, and was understood to have
immeasurable skill in the management and training of the most skittish
or vicious diseases. The evidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cleverness was of the higher
intuitive order, lying in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lady-patients' immovable conviction, and
was unassailable by any objection except that their intuitions were
opposed by others equally strong; each lady who saw medical truth in
Wrench and <div class="bookquote">``the strengthening treatment''  (<font color='red'><b>each lady</b></font>)</div>regarding Toller and <div class="bookquote">``the
lowering system''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Mrs. Tom Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>as medical perdition. For the heroic times of copious
bleeding and blistering had not yet departed, still less the times of
thorough-going theory, when disease in general was called by some bad
name, and treated accordingly without shilly-shally--as if, for
example, it were to be called insurrection, which must not be fired on
with blank-cartridge, but have its blood drawn at once. The
strengtheners and the lowerers were all <div class="bookquote">``clever''  (<font color='red'><b>strengtheners all men</b></font>)</div>men in somebody's
opinion, which is really as much as can be said for any living talents.
Nobody's imagination had gone so far as to conjecture that Mr. Lydgate
could know as much as Dr. Sprague and Dr. Minchin, the two physicians,
who alone could offer any hope when danger was extreme, and when the
smallest hope was worth a guinea. Still, I repeat, there was a general
impression that Lydgate was something rather more uncommon than any
general practitioner in Middlemarch. And this was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was but
seven-and-twenty, an age at which many men are not quite common--at
which they are hopeful of achievement, resolute in avoidance, thinking
that Mammon shall never put a bit in their mouths and get astride their
backs, but rather that Mammon, if they have anything to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
shall draw their chariot.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been left an orphan when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was fresh from a public school. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
father, a military man, had made but little provision for three
children, and when the boy Tertius asked to have a medical education,
it seemed easier to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) guardians to grant his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) request by apprenticing
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to a country practitioner than to make any objections on the score
of family dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was one of the rarer lads who early get a
decided bent and make up their minds that there is something particular
in life which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because
their fathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject with love
remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to
reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a
new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices
within, as the first traceable beginning of our love. Something of
that sort happened to Lydgate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a quick fellow, and when hot
from play, would toss himself in a corner, and in five minutes be deep
in any sort of book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands on: if it were Rasselas
or Gulliver, so much the better, but Bailey's Dictionary would do, or
the Bible with the Apocrypha in it. Something he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) must read, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>)
was not riding the pony, or running and hunting, or listening to the
talk of men. All this was true of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) at ten years of age; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) had then
read through <div class="bookquote">``Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which was
neither milk for babes, nor any chalky mixture meant to pass for milk,
and it had already occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) that books were stuff, and that life
was stupid. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) school studies had not much modified that opinion, for
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``did''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) classics and mathematics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>) was not pre-eminent in
them. It was said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bailey</b></font>), that Lydgate could do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) liked, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had certainly not yet liked to do anything remarkable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a
vigorous animal with a ready understanding, but no spark had yet
kindled in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) an intellectual passion; knowledge seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a very
superficial affair, easily mastered: judging from the conversation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) elders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had apparently got already more than was necessary for
mature life. Probably this was not an exceptional result of expensive
teaching at that period of short-waisted coats, and other fashions
which have not yet recurred. But, one vacation, a wet day sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to
the small home library to hunt once more for a book which might have
some freshness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>): in vain! unless, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took down a dusty
row of volumes with gray-paper backs and dingy labels--the volumes of
an old Cyclopaedia which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never disturbed. It would at least be
a novelty to disturb them. They were on the highest shelf, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
stood on a chair to get them down. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opened the volume which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
first took from the shelf: somehow, one is apt to read in a makeshift
attitude, just where it might seem inconvenient to do so. The page he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
opened on was under the head of Anatomy, and the first passage that
drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes was on the valves of the heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not much
acquainted with valves of any sort, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew that valvae were
folding-doors, and through this crevice came a sudden light startling
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the
human frame. A liberal education had of course left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) free to read
the indecent passages in the school classics, but beyond a general
sense of secrecy and obscenity in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) internal
structure, had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) imagination quite unbiassed, so that for
anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brains lay in small bags at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) temples, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had no more thought of representing to himself how his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) blood circulated
than how paper served instead of gold. But the moment of vocation had
come, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair, the world was made new to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) by a presentiment of endless processes filling the vast spaces
planked out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sight by that wordy ignorance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had supposed
to be knowledge. From that hour Lydgate felt the growth of an
intellectual passion.

<p/>We are not afraid of telling over and over again how a man comes to
fall in love with a woman and be wedded to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or else be fatally
parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Is it due to excess of poetry or of stupidity that we
are never weary of describing what King James called a woman's <div class="bookquote">``makdom
and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fairnesse,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>never weary of listening to the twanging of the old
Troubadour strings, and are comparatively uninterested in that other
kind of <div class="bookquote">``makdom and fairnesse''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>which must be wooed with industrious
thought and patient renunciation of small desires? In the story of
this passion, too, the development varies: sometimes it is the glorious
marriage, sometimes frustration and final parting. And not seldom the
catastrophe is bound up with the other passion, sung by the
Troubadours. For in the multitude of middle-aged men who go about
their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same
way as the tie of their cravats, there is always a good number who once
meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little. The story
of their coming to be shapen after the average and fit to be packed by
the gross, is hardly ever told even in their consciousness; for perhaps
their ardor in generous unpaid toil cooled as imperceptibly as the
ardor of other youthful loves, till one day their earlier self walked
like a ghost in its old home and made the new furniture ghastly.
Nothing in the world more subtle than the process of their gradual
change! In the beginning they inhaled it unknowingly: you and I may
have sent some of our breath towards infecting them, when we uttered
our conforming falsities or drew our silly conclusions: or perhaps it
came with the vibrations from a woman's glance.

<p/>Lydgate did not mean to be one of those failures, and there was the
better hope of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) because his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) scientific interest soon took the form
of a professional enthusiasm: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had a youthful belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
bread-winning work, not to be stifled by that initiation in makeshift
called his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) `prentice days; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) carried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) studies in London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, the conviction that the medical profession as it
might be was the finest in the world; presenting the most perfect
interchange between science and art; offering the most direct alliance
between intellectual conquest and the social good. Lydgate's nature
demanded this combination: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was an emotional creature, with a
flesh-and-blood sense of fellowship which withstood all the
abstractions of special study. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cared not only for <div class="bookquote">``cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but for
John and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth.

<p/>There was another attraction in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession: it wanted reform, and
gave a man an opportunity for some indignant resolve to reject its
venal decorations and other humbug, and to be the possessor of genuine
though undemanded qualifications. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went to study in Paris with the
determination that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came home again he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would settle in some
provincial town as a general practitioner, and resist the
irrational severance between medical and surgical knowledge in the
interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own scientific pursuits, as well as of the general
advance: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would keep away from the range of London intrigues,
jealousies, and social truckling, and win celebrity, however slowly, as
Jenner had done, by the independent value of his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) work. For it must be
remembered that this was a dark period; and in spite of venerable
colleges which used great efforts to secure purity of knowledge by
making it scarce, and to exclude error by a rigid exclusiveness in
relation to fees and appointments, it happened that very ignorant young
gentlemen were promoted in town, and many more got a legal right to
practise over large areas in the country. Also, the high standard held
up to the public mind by the College of Physicians, which gave its peculiar
sanction to the expensive and highly rarefied medical instruction
obtained by graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, did not hinder quackery
from having an excellent time of it; for since professional practice
chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred
that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could only
be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic
prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance which had taken no degrees.
Considering that statistics had not yet embraced a calculation as to
the number of ignorant or canting doctors which absolutely must exist
in the teeth of all changes, it seemed to Lydgate that a change in the
units was the most direct mode of changing the numbers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant to be
a unit who would make a certain amount of difference towards that
spreading change which would one day tell appreciably upon the
averages, and in the mean time have the pleasure of making an
advantageous difference to the viscera of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own patients. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did
not simply aim at a more genuine kind of practice than was common. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was ambitious of a wider effect: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was fired with the possibility that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might work out the proof of an anatomical conception and make a link
in the chain of discovery.

<p/>Does it seem incongruous to you that a Middlemarch surgeon should dream
of himself as a discoverer? Most of us, indeed, know little of the
great originators until they have been lifted up among the
constellations and already rule our fates. But that Herschel, for
example, who <div class="bookquote">``broke the barriers of the heavens'' (<font color='red'><b>Herschel</b></font>)</div>--did he (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>) not once play
a provincial church-organ, and give music-lessons to stumbling
pianists? Each of those Shining Ones had to walk on the earth among
neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>) gait and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>) garments
than of anything which was to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>) a title to everlasting fame:
each of them had his (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>) little local personal history sprinkled with small
temptations and sordid cares, which made the retarding friction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herschel</b></font>)
course towards final companionship with the immortals. Lydgate was not
blind to the dangers of such friction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had plenty of confidence
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) resolution to avoid it as far as possible: being
seven-and-twenty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt himself experienced. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not going to
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes
of the capital, but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with
that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the
assiduous practice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession. There was fascination in the
hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other: the careful
observation and inference which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) daily work, the use of the lens
to further his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) judgment in special cases, would further his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought as
an instrument of larger inquiry. Was not this the typical pre-eminence
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would be a good Middlemarch doctor, and by that
very means keep himself in the track of far-reaching investigation. On
one point he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
career: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make
a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are
exposing adulteration, or hold shares in a gambling-hell that they may
have leisure to represent the cause of public morality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intended to
begin in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own case some particular reforms which were quite
certainly within his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reach, and much less of a problem than the
demonstrating of an anatomical conception. One of these reforms was to
act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision, and simply
prescribe, without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from
druggists. This was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the
style of general practitioner in a country town, and would be felt as
offensive criticism by his (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) professional brethren. But Lydgate meant to
innovate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) treatment also, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was wise enough to see that the
best security for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practising honestly according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) belief was
to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary.

<p/>Perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than
the present; we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when
America was beginning to be discovered, when a bold sailor, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
were wrecked, might alight on a new kingdom; and about 1829 the dark
territories of Pathology were a fine America for a spirited young
adventurer. Lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards
enlarging the scientific, rational basis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession. The more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) became interested in special questions of disease, such as the
nature of fever or fevers, the more keenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt the need for that
fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the
century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of
Bichat, who died when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was only one-and-thirty, but, like another
Alexander, left a realm large enough for many heirs. That great
Frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies,
fundamentally considered, are not associations of organs which can be
understood by studying them first apart, and then as it were federally;
but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues,
out of which the various organs--brain, heart, lungs, and so on--are
compacted, as the various accommodations of a house are built up in
various proportions of wood, iron, stone, brick, zinc, and the rest,
each material having its peculiar composition and proportions. No man,
one sees, can understand and estimate the entire structure or its
parts--what are its frailties and what its repairs, without knowing the
nature of the materials. And the conception wrought out by Bichat,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detailed study of the different tissues, acted necessarily on
medical questions as the turning of gas-light would act on a dim,
oil-lit street, showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of
structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms
of maladies and the action of medicaments. But results which depend on
human conscience and intelligence work slowly, and now at the end of
1829, most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the
old paths, and there was still scientific work to be done which might
have seemed to be a direct sequence of Bichat's. This great seer did
not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the
living organism, marking the limit of anatomical analysis; but it was
open to another mind to say, have not these structures some common
basis from which they have all started, as your sarsnet, gauze, net,
satin, and velvet from the raw cocoon? Here would be another light, as
of oxy-hydrogen, showing the very grain of things, and revising all
former explanations. Of this sequence to Bichat's work, already
vibrating along many currents of the European mind, Lydgate was
enamoured; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of
living structure, and help to define men's thought more accurately
after the true order. The work had not yet been done, but only
prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation. What was the
primitive tissue? In that way Lydgate put the question--not quite in
the way required by the awaiting answer; but such missing of the right
word befalls many seekers. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) counted on quiet intervals to be
watchfully seized, for taking up the threads of investigation--on many
hints to be won from diligent application, not only of the scalpel, but
of the microscope, which research had begun to use again with new
enthusiasm of reliance. Such was Lydgate's plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) future: to do
good small work for Middlemarch, and great work for the world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was certainly a happy fellow at this time: to be seven-and-twenty,
without any fixed vices, with a generous resolution that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) action
should be beneficent, and with ideas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brain that made life
interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic
rites of costly observance, which the eight hundred pounds left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
after buying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice would certainly not have gone far in paying
for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was at a starting-point which makes many a man's career a fine
subject for betting, if there were any gentlemen given to that
amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an
arduous purpose, with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of
circumstance, all the niceties of inward balance, by which a man swims
and makes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) point or else is carried headlong. The risk would remain
even with close knowledge of Lydgate's character; for character too is
a process and an unfolding. The man was still in the making, as much
as the Middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer, and there were both
virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding. The faults will
not, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
Among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little
too self-confident and disdainful; whose distinguished mind is a little
spotted with commonness; who is a little pinched here and protuberant
there with native prejudices; or whose better energies are liable to
lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient
solicitations? All these things might be alleged against Lydgate, but
then, they are the periphrases of a polite preacher, who talks of Adam,
and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew-renters. The
particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled
have distinguishable physiognomies, diction, accent, and grimaces;
filling up parts in very various dramas. Our vanities differ as our
noses do: all conceit is not the same conceit, but varies in
correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us
differs from another. Lydgate's conceit was of the arrogant sort,
never simpering, never impertinent, but massive in its claims and
benevolently contemptuous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would do a great deal for noodles, being
sorry for them, and feeling quite sure that they could have no power
over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had thought of joining the Saint Simonians when he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) was in
Paris, in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines. All
his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) faults were marked by kindred traits, and were those of a man who
had a fine baritone, whose clothes hung well upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and who even in
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction. Where then lay
the spots of commonness? says a young lady enamoured of that careless
grace. How could there be any commonness in a man so well-bred, so
ambitious of social distinction, so generous and unusual in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) views
of social duty? As easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius
if you take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unawares on the wrong subject, or as many a man who has
the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill-inspired in
imagining its lighter pleasures; unable to go beyond Offenbach's music,
or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque. Lydgate's spots of
commonness lay in the complexion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) prejudices, which, in spite of
noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as are found in
ordinary men of the world: that distinction of mind which belonged to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intellectual ardor, did not penetrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) feeling and judgment
about furniture, or women, or the desirability of its being known
-LRB-without his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) telling-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was better born than other country
surgeons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not mean to think of furniture at present; but
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes
of reform would lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) above the vulgarity of feeling that there
would be an incompatibility in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) furniture not being of the best.

<p/>As to women, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous
folly, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant to be final, since marriage at some distant
period would of course not be impetuous. For those who want to be
acquainted with Lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of
impetuous folly, for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving
of passion to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was prone, together with the chivalrous kindness
which helped to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) morally lovable. The story can be told
without many words. It happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was studying in Paris, and
just at the time when, over and above his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) other work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was occupied
with some galvanic experiments. One evening, tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
experimenting, and not being able to elicit the facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) needed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and
mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks, and went to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
evening at the theatre of the Porte Saint Martin, where there was a
melodrama which he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) had already seen several times; attracted, not by
the ingenious work of the collaborating authors, but by an actress
whose part it was to stab her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) lover, mistaking him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) for the
evil-designing duke of the piece. Lydgate was in love with this
actress, as a man is in love with a woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never expects to
speak to. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a Provencale, with dark eyes, a Greek profile, and
rounded majestic form, having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet
matronliness even in youth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice was a soft cooing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
but lately come to Paris, and bore a virtuous reputation, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband
acting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as the unfortunate lover. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acting which was
<div class="bookquote">``no better than it should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>the public</b></font>)</div>but the public was satisfied. Lydgate's
only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might
have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of
violets for a while, without prejudice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) galvanism, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
would presently return. But this evening the old drama had a new
catastrophe. At the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) lover, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was to fall gracefully, the wife veritably stabbed
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, who fell as death willed. A wild shriek pierced the
house, and the Provencale fell swooning: a shriek and a swoon were
demanded by the play, but the swooning too was real this time. Lydgate
leaped and climbed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hardly knew how, on to the stage, and was active
in help, making the acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) heroine by finding a contusion
on her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) head and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) gently in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) arms. Paris rang with the
story of this death:--was it a murder? Some of the actress's warmest
admirers were inclined to believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) guilt, and liked her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) the
better for it -LRB-such was the taste of those times-RRB-; but Lydgate was not
one of these. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vehemently contended for her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) innocence, and the
remote impersonal passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) beauty which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had felt before, had
passed now into personal devotion, and tender thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) lot. The
notion of murder was absurd: no motive was discoverable, the young
couple being understood to dote on each other; and it was not
unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought
these grave consequences. The legal investigation ended in Madame
Laure's release. Lydgate by this time had had many interviews with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>), and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) more and more adorable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) talked little; but that
was an additional charm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) was melancholy, and seemed grateful; her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>)
presence was enough, like that of the evening light. Lydgate was madly
anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) affection, and jealous lest any other man than
himself should win it and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But instead of
reopening her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) engagement at the Porte Saint Martin, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) would
have been all the more popular for the fatal episode, she (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) left Paris
without warning, forsaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) little court of admirers. Perhaps no
one carried inquiry far except Lydgate, who felt that all science had
come to a stand-still while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) imagined the unhappy Laure, stricken by
ever-wandering sorrow, herself wandering, and finding no faithful
comforter. Hidden actresses, however, are not so difficult to find as
some other hidden facts, and it was not long before Lydgate gathered
indications that Laure had taken the route to Lyons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) at
last acting with great success at Avignon under the same name, looking
more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) after the play, was received with the usual
quietude which seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) beautiful as clear depths of water, and
obtained leave to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the next day; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was bent on telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) adored her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and on asking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew that
this was like the sudden impulse of a madman--incongruous even with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
habitual foibles. No matter! It was the one thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
resolved to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had two selves within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) apparently, and they must
learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments.
Strange, that some of us, with quick alternate vision, see beyond our
infatuations, and even while we rave on the heights, behold the wide
plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us.

<p/>To have approached Laure with any suit that was not reverentially
tender would have been simply a contradiction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) whole feeling
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have come all the way from Paris to find me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the
next day, sitting before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with folded arms, and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with
eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders.
<div class="bookquote">``Are all Englishmen like that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I came because I could not live without trying to see you. You are
lonely; I love you; I want you to consent to be my wife; I will wait,
but I want you to promise that you will marry me--no one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laure</b></font>)</div><p/>Laure looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in silence with a melancholy radiance from under
her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) grand eyelids, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was full of rapturous certainty, and knelt
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) knees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tell you something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) cooing way, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>)
arms folded. <div class="bookquote">``My foot really slipped.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, deprecatingly. <div class="bookquote">``It was a fatal
accident--a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laure</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Laure paused a little and then said, slowly, <div class="bookquote">''_I meant to do it._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Laure</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate, strong man as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was, turned pale and trembled: moments seemed
to pass before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rose and stood at a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There was a secret, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said at last, even vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was
brutal to you: you hated him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wearied me; he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was too fond: he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would live in Paris, and not in
my country; that was not agreeable to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in a groan of horror. <div class="bookquote">``And you planned to
murder him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not plan: it came to me in the play--_I meant to do it._''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate stood mute, and unconsciously pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat on while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw this woman--the first to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
young adoration--amid the throng of stupid criminals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a good young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Laure</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But I do not like husbands. I
will never have another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Three days afterwards Lydgate was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) galvanism again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) Paris
chambers, believing that illusions were at an end for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heart and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) belief that human life might be made better. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had more
reason than ever for trusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) judgment, now that it was so
experienced; and henceforth he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would take a strictly scientific view of
woman, entertaining no expectations but such as were justified
beforehand.

<p/>No one in Middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of Lydgate's
past as has here been faintly shadowed, and indeed the respectable
townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager
attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did
not come under their own senses. Not only young virgins of that town,
but gray-bearded men also, were often in haste to conjecture how a new
acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes, contented with very
vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) for
that instrumentality. Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing
Lydgate and assimilating him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) very comfortably.



<p/>CHAPTER XVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All that in woman is adored
In thy fair self I find--
For the whole sex can but afford
The handsome and the kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SIR CHARLES SEDLEY.


<p/>The question whether Mr. Tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain
to the hospital was an exciting topic to the Middlemarchers; and
Lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power
exercised in the town by Mr. Bulstrode. The banker was evidently a
ruler, but there was an opposition party, and even among his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) supporters
there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a
compromise, and who frankly stated their impression that the general
scheme of things, and especially the casualties of trade, required you
to hold a candle to the devil.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode's power was not due simply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) being a country banker,
who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could
touch the springs of their credit; it was fortified by a beneficence
that was at once ready and severe--ready to confer obligations, and
severe in watching the result. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had gathered, as an industrious man
always at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) post, a chief share in administering the town charities,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private charities were both minute and abundant. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take
a great deal of pains about apprenticing Tegg the shoemaker's son, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would watch over Tegg's church-going; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would defend Mrs. Strype
the washerwoman against Stubbs's unjust exaction on the score of her (<font color='blue'><b>Strype</b></font>)
drying-ground, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) would himself scrutinize a calumny against Mrs.
Strype. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) private minor loans were numerous, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) would inquire
strictly into the circumstances both before and after. In this way a
man gathers a domain in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbors' hope and fear as well as
gratitude; and power, when once it has got into that subtle region,
propagates itself, spreading out of all proportion to its external
means. It was a principle with Mr. Bulstrode to gain as much power as
possible, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) might use it for the glory of God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went through a
great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust
his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) motives, and make clear to himself what God's glory required. But,
as we have seen, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) motives were not always rightly appreciated.
There were many crass minds in Middlemarch whose reflective scales
could only weigh things in the lump; and they had a strong suspicion
that since Mr. Bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion, eating
and drinking so little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did, and worreting himself about
everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) must have a sort of vampire's feast in the sense of
mastery.

<p/>The subject of the chaplaincy came up at Mr. Vincy's table when Lydgate
was dining there, and the family connection with Mr. Bulstrode did not,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) observed, prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the
host himself, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) reasons against the proposed arrangement
turned entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) objection to Mr. Tyke's sermons, which were all
doctrine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) preference for Mr. Farebrother, whose sermons were
free from that taint. Mr. Vincy liked well enough the notion of the
chaplain's having a salary, supposing it were given to Farebrother, who
was as good a little fellow as ever breathed, and the best preacher
anywhere, and companionable too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What line shall you take, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chichely, the coroner, a
great coursing comrade of Mr. Vincy's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I'm precious glad I'm not one of the Directors now. I shall vote
for referring the matter to the Directors and the Medical Board
together. I shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders,
Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, glancing first at Dr. Sprague, the senior
physician of the town, and then at Lydgate who sat opposite. <div class="bookquote">``You
medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will
prescribe, eh, Mr. Lydgate?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know little of either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``but in general, appointments
are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking. The fittest
man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most
agreeable. Sometimes, if you wanted to get a reform, your only way
would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of, and
put them out of the question.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Sprague, who was considered the physician of most <div class="bookquote">``weight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>though
Dr. Minchin was usually said to have more <div class="bookquote">``penetration,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>divested his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
large heavy face of all expression, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wine-glass while
Lydgate was speaking. Whatever was not problematical and suspected
about this young man--for example, a certain showiness as to foreign
ideas, and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and
forgotten by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) elders--was positively unwelcome to a physician whose
standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on
Meningitis, of which at least one copy marked <div class="bookquote">``own''  (<font color='red'><b>a physician</b></font>)</div>was bound in calf.
For my part I have some fellow-feeling with Dr. Sprague: one's
self-satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very
unpleasant to find deprecated.

<p/>Lydgate's remark, however, did not meet the sense of the company. Mr.
Vincy said, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) could have _his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)_ way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would not put
disagreeable fellows anywhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hang your reforms!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chichely. ``There's no greater humbug in
the world. You never hear of a reform, but it means some trick to put
in new men. I hope you are not one of the <div class="bookquote">``Lancet's' men, Mr.
Lydgate--wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal
profession: your words appear to point that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I disapprove of Wakley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sprague</b></font>)</div>interposed Dr. Sprague, <div class="bookquote">``no man more: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
an ill-intentioned fellow, who would sacrifice the respectability of
the profession, which everybody knows depends on the London Colleges,
for the sake of getting some notoriety for himself. There are men who
don't mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about.
But Wakley is right sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sprague</b></font>)</div>the Doctor added, judicially. <div class="bookquote">``I could
mention one or two points in which Wakley is in the right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chichely, <div class="bookquote">``I blame no man for standing up in favor
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own cloth; but, coming to argument, I should like to know how a
coroner is to judge of evidence if he (<font color='blue'><b>coroner</b></font>) has not had a legal training?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``legal training only makes a man more
incompetent in questions that require knowledge a of another kind.
People talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales
by a blind Justice. No man can judge what is good evidence on any
particular subject, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows that subject well. A lawyer is no
better than an old woman at a post-mortem examination. How is he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to
know the action of a poison? You might as well say that scanning verse
will teach you to scan the potato crops.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are aware, I suppose, that it is not the coroner's business to
conduct the post-mortem, but only to take the evidence of the medical
witness?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chichely, with some scorn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.
<div class="bookquote">``Questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance
of decent knowledge in a medical witness, and the coroner ought not to
be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the
stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>practitioner</b></font>) so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that Mr. Chichely was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>)
Majesty's coroner, and ended innocently with the question, <div class="bookquote">``Don't you
agree with me, Dr. Sprague?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Chichely Majesty coroner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To a certain extent--with regard to populous districts, and in the
metropolis,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Doctor</b></font>)</div>said the Doctor. <div class="bookquote">``But I hope it will be long before this
part of the country loses the services of my friend Chichely, even
though it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I
am sure Vincy will agree with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, give me a coroner who is a good coursing man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Vincy, jovially. <div class="bookquote">``And in my opinion, you're safest with a lawyer.
Nobody can know everything. Most things are `visitation of God.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And as
to poisoning, why, what you want to know is the law. Come, shall we
join the ladies?''

<p/>Lydgate's private opinion was that Mr. Chichely might be the very
coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) had not
meant to be personal. This was one of the difficulties of moving in
good Middlemarch society: it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a
qualification for any salaried office. Fred Vincy had called Lydgate a
prig, and now Mr. Chichely was inclined to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) prick-eared;
especially when, in the drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) seemed to be making himself
eminently agreeable to Rosamond, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) had easily monopolized in a
tete-a-tete, since Mrs. Vincy herself sat at the tea-table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
resigned no domestic function to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) daughter; and the matron's
blooming good-natured face, with the two volatile pink strings floating
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) fine throat, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) cheery manners to husband and children,
was certainly among the great attractions of the Vincy
house--attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with
the daughter. The tinge of unpretentious, inoffensive vulgarity in
Mrs. Vincy gave more effect to Rosamond's refinement, which was beyond
what Lydgate had expected.

<p/>Certainly, small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression
of refined manners, and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly
right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid.
And Rosamond could say the right thing; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was clever with that
sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous.
Happily she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never attempted to joke, and this perhaps was the most
decisive mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cleverness.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and Lydgate readily got into conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had not heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sing the other day at Stone Court. The only pleasure
he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) allowed himself during the latter part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) stay in Paris was to
go and hear music.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have studied music, probably?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I know the notes of many birds, and I know many melodies by ear;
but the music that I don't know at all, and have no notion about,
delights me--affects me. How stupid the world is that it does not make
more use of such a pleasure within its reach!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and you will find Middlemarch very tuneless. There are hardly
any good musicians. I only know two gentlemen who sing at all well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way,
leaving you to fancy the tune--very much as if it were tapped on a
drum?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have heard Mr. Bowyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) rare
smiles. <div class="bookquote">``But we are speaking very ill of our neighbors.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was almost forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must carry on the conversation,
in thinking how lovely this creature was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) garment seeming to be
made out of the faintest blue sky, herself so immaculately blond, as if
the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>);
and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready,
self-possessed grace. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had had the memory of Laure, Lydgate
had lost all taste for large-eyed silence: the divine cow no longer
attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and Rosamond was her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) very opposite. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) recalled
himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will let me hear some music to-night, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will let you hear my attempts, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``Papa
is sure to insist on my singing. But I shall tremble before you, who
have heard the best singers in Paris. I have heard very little: I have
only once been to London. But our organist at St. Peter's is a good
musician, and I go on studying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me what you saw in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very little.''  (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div>-LRB-A more naive girl would have said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, everything!''
 (<font color='red'><b>A girl</b></font>)</div>But Rosamond knew better.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``A few of the ordinary sights, such as raw
country girls are always taken to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you call yourself a raw country girl?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
with an involuntary emphasis of admiration, which made Rosamond blush
with pleasure. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) remained simply serious, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) long neck a
little, and put up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hand to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wondrous hair-plaits--an
habitual gesture with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as pretty as any movements of a kitten's paw.
Not that Rosamond was in the least like a kitten: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was a sylph
caught young and educated at Mrs. Lemon's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you my mind is raw,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lemon</b></font>) said immediately; <div class="bookquote">``I pass at
Middlemarch. I am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors. But I
am really afraid of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
knowledge is of a different sort. I am sure you could teach me a
thousand things--as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were
any common language between them. Happily, there is a common language
between women and men, and so the bears can get taught.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there is Fred beginning to strum! I must go and hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) from
jarring all your nerves,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, moving to the other side of
the room, where Fred having opened the piano, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's desire,
that Rosamond might give them some music, was parenthetically
performing <div class="bookquote">``Cherry Ripe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>with one hand. Able men who have passed
their examinations will do these things sometimes, not less than the
plucked Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred, pray defer your practising till to-morrow; you will make Mr.
Lydgate ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has an ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred laughed, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tune to the end.

<p/>Rosamond turned to Lydgate, smiling gently, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You perceive,
the bears will not always be taught.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now then, Rosy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, springing from the stool and twisting it
upward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), with a hearty expectation of enjoyment. <div class="bookquote">``Some good
rousing tunes first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond played admirably. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) master at Mrs. Lemon's school -LRB-close to
a county town with a memorable history that had its relics in church
and castle-RRB- was one of those excellent musicians here and there to be
found in our provinces, worthy to compare with many a noted
Kapellmeister in a country which offers more plentiful conditions of
musical celebrity. Rosamond, with the executant's instinct, had seized
his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) manner of playing, and gave forth his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) large rendering of noble
music with the precision of an echo. It was almost startling, heard
for the first time. A hidden soul seemed to be flowing forth from
Rosamond's fingers; and so indeed it was, since souls live on in
perpetual echoes, and to all fine expression there goes somewhere an
originating activity, if it be only that of an interpreter. Lydgate
was taken possession of, and began to believe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as something
exceptional. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, one need not be surprised to find
the rare conjunctions of nature under circumstances apparently
unfavorable: come where they may, they always depend on conditions that
are not obvious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and did not rise to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
any compliments, leaving that to others, now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) admiration was
deepened.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) singing was less remarkable, but also well trained, and sweet to
hear as a chime perfectly in tune. It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sang <div class="bookquote">``Meet me by
moonlight,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``I've been roaming'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; for mortals must share the
fashions of their time, and none but the ancients can be always
classical. But Rosamond could also sing <div class="bookquote">``Black-eyed Susan''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>with
effect, or Haydn's canzonets, or <div class="bookquote">``Voi, che sapete,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haydn</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Batti,
batti'' (<font color='red'><b>Haydn</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) only wanted to know what her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) audience liked.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father looked round at the company, delighting in their admiration.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mother sat, like a Niobe before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) troubles, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) youngest
little girl on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lap, softly beating the child's hand up and down in
time to the music. And Fred, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) general scepticism
about Rosy, listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) music with perfect allegiance, wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
could do the same thing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) flute. It was the pleasantest family
party that Lydgate had seen since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came to Middlemarch. The Vincys
had the readiness to enjoy, the rejection of all anxiety, and the
belief in life as a merry lot, which made a house exceptional in most
county towns at that time, when Evangelicalism had cast a certain
suspicion as of plague-infection over the few amusements which survived
in the provinces. At the Vincys' there was always whist, and the
card-tables stood ready now, making some of the company secretly
impatient of the music. Before it ceased Mr. Farebrother came in--a
handsome, broad-chested but otherwise small man, about forty, whose
black was very threadbare: the brilliancy was all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) quick gray
eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) came like a pleasant change in the light, arresting little
Louisa with fatherly nonsense as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was being led out of the room by
Miss Morgan, greeting everybody with some special word, and seeming to
condense more talk into ten minutes than had been held all through the
evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) claimed from Lydgate the fulfilment of a promise to come
and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can't let you off, you know, because I have some
beetles to show you. We collectors feel an interest in every new man
till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen all we have to show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) swerved to the whist-table, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands and saying,
<div class="bookquote">``Come now, let us be serious! Mr. Lydgate? not play? Ah! you are too
young and light for this kind of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate said to himself that the clergyman whose abilities were so
painful to Mr. Bulstrode, appeared to have found an agreeable resort in
this certainly not erudite household. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could half understand it: the
good-humor, the good looks of elder and younger, and the provision for
passing the time without any labor of intelligence, might make the
house beguiling to people who had no particular use for their odd hours.

<p/>Everything looked blooming and joyous except Miss Morgan, who was
brown, dull, and resigned, and altogether, as Mrs. Vincy often said,
just the sort of person for a governess. Lydgate did not mean to pay
many such visits himself. They were a wretched waste of the evenings;
and now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had talked a little more to Rosamond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant to
excuse himself and go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not like us at Middlemarch, I feel sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, when the
whist-players were settled. <div class="bookquote">``We are very stupid, and you have been
used to something quite different.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose all country towns are pretty much alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.
<div class="bookquote">``But I have noticed that one always believes one's own town to be more
stupid than any other. I have made up my mind to take Middlemarch as
it comes, and shall be much obliged if the town will take me in the
same way. I have certainly found some charms in it which are much
greater than I had expected.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean the rides towards Tipton and Lowick; every one is pleased
with those,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I mean something much nearer to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond rose and reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) netting, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you care
about dancing at all? I am not quite sure whether clever men ever
dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would dance with you if you would allow me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with a slight deprecatory laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I was only
going to say that we sometimes have dancing, and I wanted to know
whether you would feel insulted if you were asked to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on the condition I mentioned.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>After this chat Lydgate thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was going, but on moving
towards the whist-tables, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) got interested in watching Mr.
Farebrother's play, which was masterly, and also his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face, which was a
striking mixture of the shrewd and the mild. At ten o'clock supper was
brought in -LRB-such were the customs of Middlemarch-RRB- and there was
punch-drinking; but Mr. Farebrother had only a glass of water. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was
winning, but there seemed to be no reason why the renewal of rubbers
should end, and Lydgate at last took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) leave.

<p/>But as it was not eleven o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chose to walk in the brisk air
towards the tower of St. Botolph's, Mr. Farebrother's church, which
stood out dark, square, and massive against the starlight. It was the
oldest church in Middlemarch; the living, however, was but a vicarage
worth barely four hundred a-year. Lydgate had heard that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
wondered now whether Mr. Farebrother cared about the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) won at
cards; thinking, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seems a very pleasant fellow, but Bulstrode may
have his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) good reasons.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Many things would be easier to Lydgate if it
should turn out that Mr. Bulstrode was generally justifiable. <div class="bookquote">``What is
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) religious doctrine to me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) carries some good notions along
with it? One must use such brains as are to be found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>These were actually Lydgate's first meditations as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked away from
Mr. Vincy's, and on this ground I fear that many ladies will consider
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hardly worthy of their attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought of Rosamond and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
music only in the second place; and though, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) turn came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
dwelt on the image of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt no
agitation, and had no sense that any new current had set into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not marry yet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wished not to marry for several years; and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not ready to entertain the notion of being in love
with a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) happened to admire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did admire Rosamond
exceedingly; but that madness which had once beset him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) about Laure was
not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, likely to recur in relation to any other woman.
Certainly, if falling in love had been at all in question, it would
have been quite safe with a creature like this Miss Vincy, who had just
the kind of intelligence one would desire in a woman--polished,
refined, docile, lending itself to finish in all the delicacies of
life, and enshrined in a body which expressed this with a force of
demonstration that excluded the need for other evidence. Lydgate felt
sure that if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) married, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife would have that feminine
radiance, that distinctive womanhood which must be classed with flowers
and music, that sort of beauty which by its very nature was virtuous,
being moulded only for pure and delicate joys.

<p/>But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not mean to marry for the next five years--his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) more
pressing business was to look into Louis' new book on Fever, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was specially interested in, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had known Louis in Paris, and
had followed many anatomical demonstrations in order to ascertain the
specific differences of typhus and typhoid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went home and read far
into the smallest hour, bringing a much more testing vision of details
and relations into this pathological study than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had ever thought it
necessary to apply to the complexities of love and marriage, these
being subjects on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt himself amply informed by literature,
and that traditional wisdom which is handed down in the genial
conversation of men. Whereas Fever had obscure conditions, and gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that delightful labor of the imagination which is not mere
arbitrariness, but the exercise of disciplined power--combining and
constructing with the clearest eye for probabilities and the fullest
obedience to knowledge; and then, in yet more energetic alliance with
impartial Nature, standing aloof to invent tests by which to try its
own work.

<p/>Many men have been praised as vividly imaginative on the strength of
their profuseness in indifferent drawing or cheap narration:--reports
of very poor talk going on in distant orbs; or portraits of Lucifer
coming down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucifer</b></font>) bad errands as a large ugly man with bat's wings and
spurts of phosphorescence; or exaggerations of wantonness that seem to
reflect life in a diseased dream. But these kinds of inspiration
Lydgate regarded as rather vulgar and vinous compared with the
imagination that reveals subtle actions inaccessible by any sort of
lens, but tracked in that outer darkness through long pathways of
necessary sequence by the inward light which is the last refinement of
Energy, capable of bathing even the ethereal atoms in its ideally
illuminated space. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) part had tossed away all cheap
inventions where ignorance finds itself able and at ease: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
enamoured of that arduous invention which is the very eye of research,
provisionally framing its object and correcting it to more and more
exactness of relation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wanted to pierce the obscurity of those
minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible
thoroughfares which are the first lurking-places of anguish, mania, and
crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of
happy or unhappy consciousness.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) book, stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) legs towards the embers in the
grate, and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head, in that agreeable
afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a
specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections with all the
rest of our existence--seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back
after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted
strength--Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) studies, and
something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
profession.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I had not taken that turn when I was a lad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I might
have got into some stupid draught-horse work or other, and lived always
in blinkers. I should never have been happy in any profession that did
not call forth the highest intellectual strain, and yet keep me in good
warm contact with my neighbors. There is nothing like the medical
profession for that: one can have the exclusive scientific life that
touches the distance and befriend the old fogies in the parish too. It
is rather harder for a clergyman: Farebrother seems to be an anomaly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This last thought brought back the Vincys and all the pictures of the
evening. They floated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind agreeably enough, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bed-candle his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lips were curled with that incipient smile which is
apt to accompany agreeable recollections. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was an ardent fellow, but
at present his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ardor was absorbed in love of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work and in the
ambition of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life recognized as a factor in the better life
of mankind--like other heroes of science who had nothing but an obscure
country practice to begin with.

<p/>Poor Lydgate! or shall I say, Poor Rosamond! Each lived in a world of
which the other knew nothing. It had not occurred to Lydgate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had been a subject of eager meditation to Rosamond, who had neither any
reason for throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) marriage into distant perspective, nor any
pathological studies to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind from that ruminating habit,
that inward repetition of looks, words, and phrases, which makes a
large part in the lives of most girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not meant to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
or speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with more than the inevitable amount of admiration and
compliment which a man must give to a beautiful girl; indeed, it seemed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyment of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) music had remained almost silent, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared falling into the rudeness of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great surprise
at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) possession of such accomplishment. But Rosamond had registered
every look and word, and estimated them as the opening incidents of a
preconceived romance--incidents which gather value from the foreseen
development and climax. In Rosamond's romance it was not necessary to
imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) serious
business in the world: of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had a profession and was clever,
as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) good birth, which distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from all Middlemarch
admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and
getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have nothing to do with vulgar people, and perhaps at last
associate with relatives quite equal to the county people who looked
down on the Middlemarchers. It was part of Rosamond's cleverness to
discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank, and once when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
seen the Miss Brookes accompanying their uncle at the county assizes,
and seated among the aristocracy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) had envied them, notwithstanding
their plain dress.

<p/>If you think it incredible that to imagine Lydgate as a man of family
could cause thrills of satisfaction which had anything to do with the
sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Brookes</b></font>) was in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), I will ask you to use your power
of comparison a little more effectively, and consider whether red cloth
and epaulets have never had an influence of that sort. Our passions do
not live apart in locked chambers, but, dressed in their small wardrobe
of notions, bring their provisions to a common table and mess together,
feeding out of the common store according to their appetite.

<p/>Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius
Lydgate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in himself, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); and it was
excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men
might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), to believe
at once that Lydgate could be no exception. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) looks and words meant
more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) than other men's, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cared more for them: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
thought of them diligently, and diligently attended to that perfection
of appearance, behavior, sentiments, and all other elegancies, which
would find in Lydgate a more adequate admirer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had yet been
conscious of.

<p/>For Rosamond, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would never do anything that was disagreeable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), was industrious; and now more than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was active in
sketching her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) landscapes and market-carts and portraits of friends, in
practising her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) music, and in being from morning till night her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own
standard of a perfect lady, having always an audience in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own
consciousness, with sometimes the not unwelcome addition of a more
variable external audience in the numerous visitors of the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
found time also to read the best novels, and even the second best, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew much poetry by heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) favorite poem was <div class="bookquote">``Lalla Rookh.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best girl in the world! He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) will be a happy fellow who gets her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>was the sentiment of the elderly gentlemen who visited the Vincys; and
the rejected young men thought of trying again, as is the fashion in
country towns where the horizon is not thick with coming rivals. But
Mrs. Plymdale thought that Rosamond had been educated to a ridiculous
pitch, for what was the use of accomplishments which would be all laid
aside as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was married? While her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt Bulstrode, who had a
sisterly faithfulness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) brother's family, had two sincere
wishes for Rosamond--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might show a more serious turn of mind,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might meet with a husband whose wealth corresponded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
habits.



<p/>CHAPTER XVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The clerkly person smiled and said
Promise was a pretty maid,
But being poor she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) died unwed.''


 (<font color='red'><b>The Rev. Camden Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>The Rev. Camden Farebrother, whom Lydgate went to see the next evening,
lived in an old parsonage, built of stone, venerable enough to match
the church which it looked out upon. All the furniture too in the
house was old, but with another grade of age--that of Mr. Farebrother's
father and grandfather. There were painted white chairs, with gilding
and wreaths on them, and some lingering red silk damask with slits in
it. There were engraved portraits of Lord Chancellors and other
celebrated lawyers of the last century; and there were old pier-glasses
to reflect them, as well as the little satin-wood tables and the sofas
resembling a prolongation of uneasy chairs, all standing in relief
against the dark wainscot. This was the physiognomy of the drawing-room
into which Lydgate was shown; and there were three ladies to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), who were also old-fashioned, and of a faded but genuine
respectability: Mrs. Farebrother, the Vicar's white-haired mother,
befrilled and kerchiefed with dainty cleanliness, upright, quick-eyed,
and still under seventy; Miss Noble, her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) sister, a tiny old lady of
meeker aspect, with frills and kerchief decidedly more worn and mended;
and Miss Winifred Farebrother, the Vicar's elder sister, well-looking
like himself, but nipped and subdued as single women are apt to be who
spend their lives in uninterrupted subjection to their elders. Lydgate
had not expected to see so quaint a group: knowing simply that Mr.
Farebrother was a bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had thought of being ushered into a
snuggery where the chief furniture would probably be books and
collections of natural objects. The Vicar himself seemed to wear
rather a changed aspect, as most men do when acquaintances made
elsewhere see them for the first time in their own homes; some indeed
showing like an actor of genial parts disadvantageously cast for the
curmudgeon in a new piece. This was not the case with Mr. Farebrother:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) seemed a trifle milder and more silent, the chief talker being his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
mother, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) only put in a good-humored moderating remark here and
there. The old lady was evidently accustomed to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) company what
they ought to think, and to regard no subject as quite safe without her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
steering. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was afforded leisure for this function by having all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
little wants attended to by Miss Winifred. Meanwhile tiny Miss Noble
carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) arm a small basket, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) diverted a bit of
sugar, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) had first dropped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) saucer as if by mistake;
looking round furtively afterwards, and reverting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) teacup with a
small innocent noise as of a tiny timid quadruped. Pray think no ill
of Miss Noble. That basket held small savings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) more portable
food, destined for the children of her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) poor friends among whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>)
trotted on fine mornings; fostering and petting all needy creatures
being so spontaneous a delight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) regarded it much as if
it had been a pleasant vice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) was addicted to. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) was
conscious of being tempted to steal from those who had much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>)
might give to those who had nothing, and carried in her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) conscience the
guilt of that repressed desire. One must be poor to know the luxury of
giving!

<p/>Mrs. Farebrother welcomed the guest with a lively formality and
precision. She (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) presently informed him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) that they were not often in want
of medical aid in that house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had brought up her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) children to wear
flannel and not to over-eat themselves, which last habit she (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) considered
the chief reason why people needed doctors. Lydgate pleaded for those
whose fathers and mothers had over-eaten themselves, but Mrs.
Farebrother held that view of things dangerous: Nature was more just
than that; it would be easy for any felon to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>felon</b></font>) ancestors
ought to have been hanged instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>felon</b></font>). If those who had bad fathers
and mothers were bad themselves, they were hanged for that. There was
no need to go back on what you couldn't see.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is like old George the Third,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) objects
to metaphysics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I object to what is wrong, Camden. I say, keep hold of a few plain
truths, and make everything square with them. When I was young, Mr.
Lydgate, there never was any question about right and wrong. We knew
our catechism, and that was enough; we learned our creed and our duty.
Every respectable Church person had the same opinions. But now, if you
speak out of the Prayer-book itself, you are liable to be contradicted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes rather a pleasant time of it for those who like to maintain
their own point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my mother always gives way,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, slyly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Camden, you must not lead Mr. Lydgate into a mistake about
_me_. I shall never show that disrespect to my parents, to give up what
they taught me. Any one may see what comes of turning. If you change
once, why not twenty times?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A man might see good arguments for changing once, and not see them for
changing again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, amused with the decisive old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, they are never wanting,
when a man has no constancy of mind. My father never changed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man--few
better. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get
you a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That's my opinion,
and I think anybody's stomach will bear me out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About the dinner certainly, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the same thing, the dinner or the man. I am nearly seventy, Mr.
Lydgate, and I go upon experience. I am not likely to follow new
lights, though there are plenty of them here as elsewhere. I say, they
came in with the mixed stuffs that will neither wash nor wear. It was
not so in my youth: a Churchman was a Churchman, and a clergyman, you
might be pretty sure, was a gentleman, if nothing else. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) may
be no better than a Dissenter, and want to push aside my son on
pretence of doctrine. But whoever may wish to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) aside, I am
proud to say, Mr. Lydgate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will compare with any preacher in
this kingdom, not to speak of this town, which is but a low standard to
go by; at least, to my thinking, for I was born and bred at Exeter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mother is never partial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``What do
you think Tyke's mother says about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor creature! what indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) sharpness
blunted for the moment by her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) confidence in maternal judgments. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
says the truth to herself, depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what is the truth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``I am curious to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nothing bad at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is a zealous
fellow: not very learned, and not very wise, I think--because I don't
agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Camden!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Winifred</b></font>)</div>said Miss Winifred, <div class="bookquote">``Griffin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Griffin</b></font>) wife told me only
to-day, that Mr. Tyke said they should have no more coals if they came
to hear you preach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Winifred</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Farebrother laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) knitting, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had resumed after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) small allowance of tea and toast, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) son as if to
say <div class="bookquote">``You hear that?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>Miss Noble said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh poor things! poor things!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in reference, probably, to the double loss of preaching and coal. But
the Vicar answered quietly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because they are not my parishioners. And I don't think my
sermons are worth a load of coals to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, who could not let this pass, <div class="bookquote">``you
don't know my son: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) always undervalues himself. I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is
undervaluing the God who made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a most excellent
preacher.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be a hint for me to take Mr. Lydgate away to my study,
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``I promised to show you my
collection,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) added, turning to Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``shall we go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>All three ladies remonstrated. Mr. Lydgate ought not to be hurried
away without being allowed to accept another cup of tea: Miss Winifred
had abundance of good tea in the pot. Why was Camden in such haste to
take a visitor to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) den? There was nothing but pickled vermin, and
drawers full of blue-bottles and moths, with no carpet on the floor.
Mr. Lydgate must excuse it. A game at cribbage would be far better.
In short, it was plain that a vicar might be adored by his (<font color='blue'><b>vicar</b></font>) womankind as
the king of men and preachers, and yet be held by them to stand in much
need of their direction. Lydgate, with the usual shallowness of a
young bachelor, wondered that Mr. Farebrother had not taught them
better.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother is not used to my having visitors who can take any interest
in my hobbies,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) opened the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) study,
which was indeed as bare of luxuries for the body as the ladies had
implied, unless a short porcelain pipe and a tobacco-box were to be
excepted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Men of your profession don't generally smoke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said. Lydgate
smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Nor of mine either, properly, I suppose.
You will hear that pipe alleged against me by Bulstrode and Company.
They don't know how pleased the devil would be if I gave it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. You are of an excitable temper and want a sedative. I
am heavier, and should get idle with it. I should rush into idleness,
and stagnate there with all my might.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you mean to give it all to your work. I am some ten or twelve
years older than you, and have come to a compromise. I feed a weakness
or two lest they should get clamorous. See,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>continued the Vicar,
opening several small drawers, <div class="bookquote">``I fancy I have made an exhaustive study
of the entomology of this district. I am going on both with the fauna
and flora; but I have at least done my insects well. We are singularly
rich in orthoptera: I don't know whether--Ah! you have got hold of that
glass jar--you are looking into that instead of my drawers. You don't
really care about these things?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by the side of this lovely anencephalous monster. I have never
had time to give myself much to natural history. I was early bitten
with an interest in structure, and it is what lies most directly in my
profession. I have no hobby besides. I have the sea to swim in there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are a happy fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) heel
and beginning to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) pipe. ``You don't know what it is to want
spiritual tobacco--bad emendations of old texts, or small items about a
variety of Aphis Brassicae, with the well-known signature of
Philomicron, for the <div class="bookquote">``Twaddler's Magazine;' or a learned treatise on
the entomology of the Pentateuch, including all the insects not
mentioned, but probably met with by the Israelites in their passage
through the desert; with a monograph on the Ant, as treated by Solomon,
showing the harmony of the Book of Proverbs with the results of modern
research. You don't mind my fumigating you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was more surprised at the openness of this talk than at its
implied meaning--that the Vicar felt himself not altogether in the
right vocation. The neat fitting-up of drawers and shelves, and the
bookcase filled with expensive illustrated books on Natural History,
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) think again of the winnings at cards and their destination.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was beginning to wish that the very best construction of
everything that Mr. Farebrother did should be the true one. The
Vicar's frankness seemed not of the repulsive sort that comes from an
uneasy consciousness seeking to forestall the judgment of others, but
simply the relief of a desire to do with as little pretence as
possible. Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was not without a sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) freedom of
speech might seem premature, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) presently said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not yet told you that I have the advantage of you, Mr. Lydgate,
and know you better than you know me. You remember Trawley who shared
your apartment at Paris for some time? I was a correspondent of his (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) told me a good deal about you. I was not quite sure when you
first came that you were the same man. I was very glad when I found
that you were. Only I don't forget that you have not had the like
prologue about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate divined some delicacy of feeling here, but did not half
understand it. <div class="bookquote">``By the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what has become of Trawley? I
have quite lost sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hot on the French social systems,
and talked of going to the Backwoods to found a sort of Pythagorean
community. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is practising at a German bath, and has married a rich
patient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then my notions wear the best, so far,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with a short
scornful laugh. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have it, the medical profession was an
inevitable system of humbug. I said, the fault was in the men--men who
truckle to lies and folly. Instead of preaching against humbug outside
the walls, it might be better to set up a disinfecting apparatus
within. In short--I am reporting my own conversation--you may be sure
I had all the good sense on my side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your scheme is a good deal more difficult to carry out than the
Pythagorean community, though. You have not only got the old Adam in
yourself against you, but you have got all those descendants of the
original Adam who form the society around you. You see, I have paid
twelve or thirteen years more than you for my knowledge of
difficulties. But'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Farebrother broke off a moment, and then
added, <div class="bookquote">``you are eying that glass vase again. Do you want to make an
exchange? You shall not have it without a fair barter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>``I have some sea-mice--fine specimens--in spirits. And I will throw in
Robert Brown's new thing--<div class="bookquote">``Microscopic Observations on the Pollen of
Plants'--if you don't happen to have it already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, seeing how you long for the monster, I might ask a higher price.
Suppose I ask you to look through my drawers and agree with me about
all my new species?''  (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div>The Vicar, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) talked in this way,
alternately moved about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mouth, and returned to
hang rather fondly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) drawers. <div class="bookquote">``That would be good discipline,
you know, for a young doctor who has to please his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) patients in
Middlemarch. You must learn to be bored, remember. However, you shall
have the monster on your own terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think men overrate the necessity for humoring everybody's
nonsense, till they get despised by the very fools they humor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate, moving to Mr. Farebrother's side, and looking rather absently
at the insects ranged in fine gradation, with names subscribed in

that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart. But then you must be sure of having the value, and
you must keep yourself independent. Very few men can do that. Either
you slip out of service altogether, and become good for nothing, or you
wear the harness and draw a good deal where your yoke-fellows pull you.
But do look at these delicate orthoptera!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate had after all to give some scrutiny to each drawer, the Vicar
laughing at himself, and yet persisting in the exhibition.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Apropos of what you said about wearing harness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate began, after
they had sat down, <div class="bookquote">``I made up my mind some time ago to do with as
little of it as possible. That was why I determined not to try anything
in London, for a good many years at least. I didn't like what I saw
when I was studying there--so much empty bigwiggism, and obstructive
trickery. In the country, people have less pretension to knowledge,
and are less of companions, but for that reason they affect one's
amour-propre less: one makes less bad blood, and can follow one's own
course more quietly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--well--you have got a good start; you are in the right profession,
the work you feel yourself most fit for. Some people miss that, and
repent too late. But you must not be too sure of keeping your
independence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean of family ties?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, conceiving that these might
press rather tightly on Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not altogether. Of course they make many things more difficult. But
a good wife--a good unworldly woman--may really help a man, and keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more independent. There's a parishioner of mine--a fine fellow,
but who would hardly have pulled through as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has done without his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
wife. Do you know the Garths? I think they were not Peacock's
patients.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but there is a Miss Garth at old Featherstone's, at Lowick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Their daughter: an excellent girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is very quiet--I have hardly noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has taken notice of you, though, depend upon it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could hardly say <div class="bookquote">``Of course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gauges everybody. I prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for confirmation--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a
favorite of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother puffed a few moments in silence, Lydgate not caring to
know more about the Garths. At last the Vicar laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pipe,
stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) legs, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) bright eyes with a smile towards
Lydgate, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But we Middlemarchers are not so tame as you take us to be. We have
our intrigues and our parties. I am a party man, for example, and
Bulstrode is another. If you vote for me you will offend Bulstrode.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there against Bulstrode?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, emphatically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say there was anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) except that. If you vote
against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) you will make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) your enemy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I need mind about that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, rather
proudly; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to have good ideas about hospitals, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
spends large sums on useful public objects. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might help me a good
deal in carrying out my ideas. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) religious notions--why, as
Voltaire said, incantations will destroy a flock of sheep if
administered with a certain quantity of arsenic. I look for the man
who will bring the arsenic, and don't mind about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) incantations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good. But then you must not offend your arsenic-man. You will
not offend me, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, quite unaffectedly. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't translate my own convenience into other people's duties. I am
opposed to Bulstrode in many ways. I don't like the set he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belongs to:
they are a narrow ignorant set, and do more to make their neighbors
uncomfortable than to make them better. Their system is a sort of
worldly-spiritual cliqueism: they really look on the rest of mankind as
a doomed carcass which is to nourish them for heaven. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) added,
smilingly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't say that Bulstrode's new hospital is a bad thing;
and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wanting to oust me from the old one--why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thinks me
a mischievous fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) is only returning a compliment. And I am not
a model clergyman--only a decent makeshift.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was not at all sure that the Vicar maligned himself. A model
clergyman, like a model doctor, ought to think his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own profession the
finest in the world, and take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
moral pathology and therapeutics. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``What reason does
Bulstrode give for superseding you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I don't teach his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) opinions--which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) calls spiritual religion;
and that I have no time to spare. Both statements are true. But then
I could make time, and I should be glad of the forty pounds. That is
the plain fact of the case. But let us dismiss it. I only wanted to
tell you that if you vote for your arsenic-man, you are not to cut me
in consequence. I can't spare you. You are a sort of circumnavigator
come to settle among us, and will keep up my belief in the antipodes.
Now tell me all about them in Paris.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sir, the loftiest hopes on earth
Draw lots with meaner hopes: heroic breasts,
Breathing bad air, ran risk of pestilence;
Or, lacking lime-juice when they cross the Line,
May languish with the scurvy.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Some weeks passed after this conversation before the question of the
chaplaincy gathered any practical import for Lydgate, and without
telling himself the reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) deferred the predetermination on which
side he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should give his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vote. It would really have been a matter of
total indifference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)--that is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have taken the more
convenient side, and given his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vote for the appointment of Tyke without
any hesitation--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not cared personally for Mr. Farebrother.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) liking for the Vicar of St. Botolph's grew with growing
acquaintanceship. That, entering into Lydgate's position as a
new-comer who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own professional objects to secure, Mr.
Farebrother should have taken pains rather to warn off than to obtain
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) interest, showed an unusual delicacy and generosity, which
Lydgate's nature was keenly alive to. It went along with other points
of conduct in Mr. Farebrother which were exceptionally fine, and made
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) character resemble those southern landscapes which seem divided
between natural grandeur and social slovenliness. Very few men could
have been as filial and chivalrous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was to the mother, aunt, and
sister, whose dependence on him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had in many ways shaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) life rather
uneasily for himself; few men who feel the pressure of small needs are
so nobly resolute not to dress up their inevitably self-interested
desires in a pretext of better motives. In these matters he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was
conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) life would bear the closest scrutiny; and perhaps
the consciousness encouraged a little defiance towards the critical
strictness of persons whose celestial intimacies seemed not to improve
their domestic manners, and whose lofty aims were not needed to account
for their actions. Then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) preaching was ingenious and pithy, like
the preaching of the English Church in its robust age, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) sermons
were delivered without book. People outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) parish went to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>); and, since to fill the church was always the most difficult part
of a clergyman's function, here was another ground for a careless sense
of superiority. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was a likable man: sweet-tempered,
ready-witted, frank, without grins of suppressed bitterness or other
conversational flavors which make half of us an affliction to our
friends. Lydgate liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heartily, and wished for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friendship.

<p/>With this feeling uppermost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) continued to waive the question of the
chaplaincy, and to persuade himself that it was not only no proper
business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), but likely enough never to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with a demand for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vote. Lydgate, at Mr. Bulstrode's request, was laying down plans
for the internal arrangements of the new hospital, and the two were
often in consultation. The banker was always presupposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
could count in general on Lydgate as a coadjutor, but made no special
recurrence to the coming decision between Tyke and Farebrother. When
the General Board of the Infirmary had met, however, and Lydgate had
notice that the question of the chaplaincy was thrown on a council of
the directors and medical men, to meet on the following Friday, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
a vexed sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind on this trivial Middlemarch
business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not help hearing within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the distinct
declaration that Bulstrode was prime minister, and that the Tyke affair
was a question of office or no office; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not help an equally
pronounced dislike to giving up the prospect of office. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
observation was constantly confirming Mr. Farebrother's assurance that
the banker would not overlook opposition. <div class="bookquote">``Confound their petty
politics!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) thoughts for three mornings in the meditative
process of shaving, when he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had begun to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) must really hold
a court of conscience on this matter. Certainly there were valid
things to be said against the election of Mr. Farebrother: he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had too
much on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) hands already, especially considering how much time he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
spent on non-clerical occupations. Then again it was a continually
repeated shock, disturbing Lydgate's esteem, that the Vicar should
obviously play for the sake of money, liking the play indeed, but
evidently liking some end which it served. Mr. Farebrother contended
on theory for the desirability of all games, and said that Englishmen's
wit was stagnant for want of them; but Lydgate felt certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
would have played very much less but for the money. There was a
billiard-room at the Green Dragon, which some anxious mothers and wives
regarded as the chief temptation in Middlemarch. The Vicar was a
first-rate billiard-player, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did not frequent the Green
Dragon, there were reports that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had sometimes been there in the
daytime and had won money. And as to the chaplaincy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) did not
pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) cared for it, except for the sake of the forty pounds.
Lydgate was no Puritan, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not care for play, and winning money
at it had always seemed a meanness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had an ideal of
life which made this subservience of conduct to the gaining of small
sums thoroughly hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Hitherto in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own life his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wants had
been supplied without any trouble to himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) first impulse was
always to be liberal with half-crowns as matters of no importance to a
gentleman; it had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to devise a plan for getting
half-crowns. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had always known in a general way that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not
rich, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had never felt poor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no power of imagining the
part which the want of money plays in determining the actions of men.
Money had never been a motive to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not ready to frame
excuses for this deliberate pursuit of small gains. It was altogether
repulsive to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never entered into any calculation of the
ratio between the Vicar's income and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) more or less necessary
expenditure. It was possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would not have made such a
calculation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own case.

<p/>And now, when the question of voting had come, this repulsive fact told
more strongly against Mr. Farebrother than it had done before. One
would know much better what to do if men's characters were more
consistent, and especially if one's friends were invariably fit for any
function they desired to undertake! Lydgate was convinced that if
there had been no valid objection to Mr. Farebrother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) would have
voted for him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>), whatever Bulstrode might have felt on the subject: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
did not intend to be a vassal of Bulstrode's. On the other hand, there
was Tyke, a man entirely given to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clerical office, who was simply
curate at a chapel of ease in St. Peter's parish, and had time for
extra duty. Nobody had anything to say against Mr. Tyke, except that
they could not bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>), and suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>) of cant. Really, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>)
point of view, Bulstrode was thoroughly justified.

<p/>But whichever way Lydgate began to incline, there was something to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wince; and being a proud man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a little exasperated at being
obliged to wince. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not like frustrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own best purposes by
getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not like voting against
Farebrother, and helping to deprive him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) of function and salary; and the
question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave
the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards.
Moreover, Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for
Tyke he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself.
But would the end really be his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own convenience? Other people would
say so, and would allege that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was currying favor with Bulstrode for
the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world. What
then? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own part knew that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) personal prospects simply
had been concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would not have cared a rotten nut for the
banker's friendship or enmity. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) really cared for was a medium
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work, a vehicle for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ideas; and after all, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not bound
to prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could
demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test therapeutic
results, before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the
first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of
small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) inward debate, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) set out for the hospital, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hope was
really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to
the question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for
voting. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) trusted a little also to the energy which is
begotten by circumstances--some feeling rushing warmly and making
resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more
difficult. However it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not distinctly say to himself on
which side he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would vote; and all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was inwardly resenting
the subjection which had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). It would have seemed
beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
unmixed resolutions of independence and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) select purposes, would find
himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of
which was repugnant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) student's chambers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
prearranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) social action quite differently.

<p/>Lydgate was late in setting out, but Dr. Sprague, the two other
surgeons, and several of the directors had arrived early; Mr.
Bulstrode, treasurer and chairman, being among those who were still
absent. The conversation seemed to imply that the issue was
problematical, and that a majority for Tyke was not so certain as had
been generally supposed. The two physicians, for a wonder, turned out
to be unanimous, or rather, though of different minds, they concurred
in action. Dr. Sprague, the rugged and weighty, was, as every one had
foreseen, an adherent of Mr. Farebrother. The Doctor was more than
suspected of having no religion, but somehow Middlemarch tolerated this
deficiency in him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had been a Lord Chancellor; indeed it is
probable that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) professional weight was the more believed in, the
world-old association of cleverness with the evil principle being still
potent in the minds even of lady-patients who had the strictest ideas
of frilling and sentiment. It was perhaps this negation in the Doctor
which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) neighbors call him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) hard-headed and dry-witted;
conditions of texture which were also held favorable to the storing of
judgments connected with drugs. At all events, it is certain that if
any medical man had come to Middlemarch with the reputation of having
very definite religious views, of being given to prayer, and of
otherwise showing an active piety, there would have been a general
presumption against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) medical skill.

<p/>On this ground it was -LRB-professionally speaking-RRB- fortunate for Dr.
Minchin that his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) religious sympathies were of a general kind, and such
as gave a distant medical sanction to all serious sentiment, whether of
Church or Dissent, rather than any adhesion to particular tenets. If
Mr. Bulstrode insisted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was apt to do, on the Lutheran doctrine
of justification, as that by which a Church must stand or fall, Dr.
Minchin in return was quite sure that man was not a mere machine or a
fortuitous conjunction of atoms; if Mrs. Wimple insisted on a
particular providence in relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) stomach complaint, Dr. Minchin
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) part liked to keep the mental windows open and objected to
fixed limits; if the Unitarian brewer jested about the Athanasian
Creed, Dr. Minchin quoted Pope's <div class="bookquote">``Essay on Man.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pope</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) objected to the
rather free style of anecdote in which Dr. Sprague indulged, preferring
well-sanctioned quotations, and liking refinement of all kinds: it was
generally known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) had some kinship to a bishop, and sometimes
spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) holidays at <div class="bookquote">``the palace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a bishop</b></font>)</div><p/>Dr. Minchin was soft-handed, pale-complexioned, and of rounded outline,
not to be distinguished from a mild clergyman in appearance: whereas
Dr. Sprague was superfluously tall; his (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) trousers got creased at the
knees, and showed an excess of boot at a time when straps seemed
necessary to any dignity of bearing; you heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) go in and out, and
up and down, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) had come to see after the roofing. In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>)
had weight, and might be expected to grapple with a disease and throw
it; while Dr. Minchin might be better able to detect it lurking and to
circumvent it. They enjoyed about equally the mysterious privilege of
medical reputation, and concealed with much etiquette their contempt
for each other's skill. Regarding themselves as Middlemarch
institutions, they were ready to combine against all innovators, and
against non-professionals given to interference. On this ground they
were both in their hearts equally averse to Mr. Bulstrode, though Dr.
Minchin had never been in open hostility with him (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>), and never differed
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) without elaborate explanation to Mrs. Bulstrode, who had found
that Dr. Minchin alone understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) constitution. A layman who pried
into the professional conduct of medical men, and was always obtruding
his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) reforms,--though he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) was less directly embarrassing to the two
physicians than to the surgeon-apothecaries who attended paupers by
contract, was nevertheless offensive to the professional nostril as
such; and Dr. Minchin shared fully in the new pique against Bulstrode,
excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) apparent determination to patronize Lydgate. The
long-established practitioners, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Toller; were just
now standing apart and having a friendly colloquy, in which they agreed
that Lydgate was a jackanapes, just made to serve Bulstrode's purpose.
To non-medical friends they had already concurred in praising the other
young practitioner, who had come into the town on Mr. Peacock's
retirement without further recommendation than his (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) own merits and such
argument for solid professional acquirement as might be gathered from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) having apparently wasted no time on other branches of knowledge.
It was clear that Lydgate, by not dispensing drugs, intended to cast
imputations on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) equals, and also to obscure the limit between his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
own rank as a general practitioner and that of the physicians, who, in
the interest of the profession, felt bound to maintain its various
grades,--especially against a man who had not been to either of the
English universities and enjoyed the absence of anatomical and bedside
study there, but came with a libellous pretension to experience in
Edinburgh and Paris, where observation might be abundant indeed, but
hardly sound.

<p/>Thus it happened that on this occasion Bulstrode became identified with
Lydgate, and Lydgate with Tyke; and owing to this variety of
interchangeable names for the chaplaincy question, diverse minds were
enabled to form the same judgment concerning it.

<p/>Dr. Sprague said at once bluntly to the group assembled when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>)
entered, <div class="bookquote">``I go for Farebrother. A salary, with all my heart. But why
take it from the Vicar? He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) has none too much--has to insure his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) life,
besides keeping house, and doing a vicar's charities. Put forty pounds
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pocket and you'll do no harm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)'s a good fellow, is
Farebrother, with as little of the parson about him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) as will serve to
carry orders.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, ho! Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Powderell</b></font>)</div>said old Mr. Powderell, a retired iron-monger of
some standing--his (<font color='blue'><b>Powderell</b></font>) interjection being something between a laugh and a
Parliamentary disapproval; <div class="bookquote">``we must let you have your say. But what we
have to consider is not anybody's income--it's the souls of the poor
sick people'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Powderell</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Powderell's voice and face had a sincere pathos
in them. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) is a real Gospel preacher, is Mr. Tyke. I should vote

speech, whose glittering spectacles and erect hair were turned with
some severity towards innocent Mr. Powderell. <div class="bookquote">``But in my judgment it
behoves us, as Directors, to consider whether we will regard it as our

quarter. Will any member of the committee aver that he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would have
entertained the idea of displacing the gentleman who has always
discharged the function of chaplain here, if it had not been suggested
to him (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) by parties whose disposition it is to regard every institution
of this town as a machinery for carrying out their own views? I tax no
man's motives: let them lie between himself and a higher Power; but I
do say, that there are influences at work here which are incompatible
with genuine independence, and that a crawling servility is usually
dictated by circumstances which gentlemen so conducting themselves
could not afford either morally or financially to avow. I myself am a
layman, but I have given no inconsiderable attention to the divisions
in the Church and--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, damn the divisions!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>burst in Mr. Frank Hawley, lawyer and
town-clerk, who rarely presented himself at the board, but now looked
in hurriedly, whip in hand. <div class="bookquote">``We have nothing to do with them here.
Farebrother has been doing the work--what there was--without pay, and
if pay is to be given, it should be given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>). I call it a
confounded job to take the thing away from Farebrother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it would be as well for gentlemen not to give their remarks a
personal bearing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ned Plymdale/Mr. Plymdale/Mr. Ned</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Plymdale. <div class="bookquote">``I shall vote for the
appointment of Mr. Tyke, but I should not have known, if Mr. Hackbutt
hadn't hinted it, that I was a Servile Crawler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I disclaim any personalities. I expressly said, if I may be allowed
to repeat, or even to conclude what I was about to say--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, here's Minchin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Frank Hawley; at which everybody turned
away from Mr. Hackbutt, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) to feel the uselessness of superior
gifts in Middlemarch. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Doctor, I must have you on the right
side, eh?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Minchin, nodding and shaking hands here and
there; <div class="bookquote">``at whatever cost to my feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If there's any feeling here, it should be feeling for the man who is
turned out, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Frank Hawley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess I have feelings on the other side also. I have a divided
esteem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Minchin, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``I consider Mr. Tyke an
exemplary man--none more so--and I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>) to be proposed from
unimpeachable motives. I, for my part, wish that I could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>) my
vote. But I am constrained to take a view of the case which gives the
preponderance to Mr. Farebrother's claims. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is an amiable man, an
able preacher, and has been longer among us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Powderell</b></font>)</div><p/>Old Mr. Powderell looked on, sad and silent. Mr. Plymdale settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>)
cravat, uneasily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't set up Farebrother as a pattern of what a clergyman ought to
be, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Larcher</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Larcher, the eminent carrier, who had just come
in. <div class="bookquote">``I have no ill-will towards him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), but I think we owe something to
the public, not to speak of anything higher, in these appointments. In
my opinion Farebrother is too lax for a clergyman. I don't wish to
bring up particulars against him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) will make a little attendance
here go as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a devilish deal better than too much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, whose bad
language was notorious in that part of the county. <div class="bookquote">``Sick people can't
bear so much praying and preaching. And that methodistical sort of
religion is bad for the spirits--bad for the inside, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) added,
turning quickly round to the four medical men who were assembled.

<p/>But any answer was dispensed with by the entrance of three gentlemen,
with whom there were greetings more or less cordial. These were the
Reverend Edward Thesiger, Rector of St. Peter's, Mr. Bulstrode, and our
friend Mr. Brooke of Tipton, who had lately allowed himself to be put
on the board of directors in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) turn, but had never before attended,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) attendance now being due to Mr. Bulstrode's exertions. Lydgate was
the only person still expected.

<p/>Every one now sat down, Mr. Bulstrode presiding, pale and
self-restrained as usual. Mr. Thesiger, a moderate evangelical, wished
for the appointment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>) friend Mr. Tyke, a zealous able man, who,
officiating at a chapel of ease, had not a cure of souls too extensive
to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>) ample time for the new duty. It was desirable that
chaplaincies of this kind should be entered on with a fervent
intention: they were peculiar opportunities for spiritual influence;
and while it was good that a salary should be allotted, there was the
more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted
into a mere question of salary. Mr. Thesiger's manner had so much
quiet propriety that objectors could only simmer in silence.

<p/>Mr. Brooke believed that everybody meant well in the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
not himself attended to the affairs of the Infirmary, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had a
strong interest in whatever was for the benefit of Middlemarch, and was
most happy to meet the gentlemen present on any public question--<div class="bookquote">``any
public question, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke repeated, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) nod of
perfect understanding. <div class="bookquote">``I am a good deal occupied as a magistrate, and
in the collection of documentary evidence, but I regard my time as
being at the disposal of the public--and, in short, my friends have
convinced me that a chaplain with a salary--a salary, you know--is a
very good thing, and I am happy to be able to come here and vote for
the appointment of Mr. Tyke, who, I understand, is an unexceptionable
man, apostolic and eloquent and everything of that kind--and I am the
last man to withhold my vote--under the circumstances, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me that you have been crammed with one side of the
question, Mr. Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Frank Hawley, who was afraid of nobody,
and was a Tory suspicious of electioneering intentions. <div class="bookquote">``You don't
seem to know that one of the worthiest men we have has been doing duty
as chaplain here for years without pay, and that Mr. Tyke is proposed
to supersede him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mr. Hawley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Brooke has been
fully informed of Mr. Farebrother's character and position.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) enemies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>flashed out Mr. Hawley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust there is no personal hostility concerned here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thesiger</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Thesiger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll swear there is, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Hawley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, in a subdued tone, <div class="bookquote">``the merits of the
question may be very briefly stated, and if any one present doubts that
every gentleman who is about to give his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) vote has not been fully
informed, I can now recapitulate the considerations that should weigh
on either side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see the good of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we all
know whom we mean to vote for. Any man who wants to do justice does
not wait till the last minute to hear both sides of the question. I
have no time to lose, and I propose that the matter be put to the vote
at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>each person</b></font>)</div><p/>A brief but still hot discussion followed before each person wrote
<div class="bookquote">``Tyke''  (<font color='red'><b>each person</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``Farebrother''  (<font color='red'><b>each person</b></font>)</div>on a piece of paper and slipped it into a glass
tumbler; and in the mean time Mr. Bulstrode saw Lydgate enter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I perceive that the votes are equally divided at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bulstrode, in a clear biting voice. Then, looking up at Lydgate--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a casting-vote still to be given. It is yours, Mr. Lydgate:
will you be good enough to write?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The thing is settled now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wrench</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wrench, rising. <div class="bookquote">``We all know how
Mr. Lydgate will vote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to speak with some peculiar meaning, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
rather defiantly, and keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pencil suspended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely mean that you are expected to vote with Mr. Bulstrode. Do
you regard that meaning as offensive?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It may be offensive to others. But I shall not desist from voting
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) on that account.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate immediately wrote down <div class="bookquote">``Tyke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>So the Rev. Walter Tyke became chaplain to the Infirmary, and Lydgate
continued to work with Mr. Bulstrode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was really uncertain whether
Tyke were not the more suitable candidate, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) consciousness
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been quite free from indirect bias he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should
have voted for Mr. Farebrother. The affair of the chaplaincy remained
a sore point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) memory as a case in which this petty medium of
Middlemarch had been too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>). How could a man be satisfied
with a decision between such alternatives and under such circumstances?
No more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has chosen from
among such shapes as the resources of the age offer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), wearing it at
best with a resignation which is chiefly supported by comparison.

<p/>But Mr. Farebrother met him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) with the same friendliness as before. The
character of the publican and sinner is not always practically
incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us
scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the
faultiness of our own arguments, or the dulness of our own jokes. But
the Vicar of St. Botolph's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture
of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was too
much as other men were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had become remarkably unlike them in
this--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) could excuse others for thinking slightly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and
could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The world has been too strong for _me_, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) said one day to
Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``But then I am not a mighty man--I shall never be a man of
renown. The choice of Hercules is a pretty fable; but Prodicus makes
it easy work for the hero, as if the first resolves were enough.
Another story says that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) came to hold the distaff, and at last wore
the Nessus shirt. I suppose one good resolve might keep a man right if
everybody else's resolve helped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vicar's talk was not always inspiriting: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had escaped being a
Pharisee, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not escaped that low estimate of possibilities
which we rather hastily arrive at as an inference from our own failure.
Lydgate thought that there was a pitiable infirmity of will in Mr.
Farebrother.



<p/>CHAPTER XIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``L' altra vedete ch`ha fatto alla guancia
Della sua palma, sospirando, letto.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Purgatorio, vii.


<p/>When George the Fourth was still reigning over the privacies of
Windsor, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, and Mr. Vincy
was mayor of the old corporation in Middlemarch, Mrs. Casaubon, born
Dorothea Brooke, had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) wedding journey to Rome. In those days
the world in general was more ignorant of good and evil by forty years
than it is at present. Travellers did not often carry full information
on Christian art either in their heads or their pockets; and even the
most brilliant English critic of the day mistook the flower-flushed
tomb of the ascended Virgin for an ornamental vase due to the painter's
fancy. Romanticism, which has helped to fill some dull blanks with
love and knowledge, had not yet penetrated the times with its leaven
and entered into everybody's food; it was fermenting still as a
distinguishable vigorous enthusiasm in certain long-haired German
artists at Rome, and the youth of other nations who worked or idled
near them were sometimes caught in the spreading movement.

<p/>One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long, but
abundant and curly, and who was otherwise English in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) equipment, had
just turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back on the Belvedere Torso in the Vatican and was
looking out on the magnificent view of the mountains from the adjoining
round vestibule. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sufficiently absorbed not to notice the
approach of a dark-eyed, animated German who came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) and placing
a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) shoulder, said with a strong accent, <div class="bookquote">``Come here, quick!
else she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) will have changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) pose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Quickness was ready at the call, and the two figures passed lightly
along by the Meleager, towards the hall where the reclining Ariadne,
then called the Cleopatra, lies in the marble voluptuousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>)
beauty, the drapery folding around her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) with a petal-like ease and
tenderness. They were just in time to see another figure standing
against a pedestal near the reclining marble: a breathing blooming
girl, whose form, not shamed by the Ariadne, was clad in Quakerish gray
drapery; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long cloak, fastened at the neck, was thrown backward from
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms, and one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cheek, pushing
somewhat backward the white beaver bonnet which made a sort of halo to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face around the simply braided dark-brown hair. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was not
looking at the sculpture, probably not thinking of it: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) large eyes
were fixed dreamily on a streak of sunlight which fell across the
floor. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) became conscious of the two strangers who suddenly
paused as if to contemplate the Cleopatra, and, without looking at
them, immediately turned away to join a maid-servant and courier who
were loitering along the hall at a little distance off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of that for a fine bit of antithesis?''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said the
German, searching in his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) friend's face for responding admiration, but
going on volubly without waiting for any other answer. <div class="bookquote">``There lies
antique beauty, not corpse-like even in death, but arrested in the
complete contentment of its sensuous perfection: and here stands beauty
in its breathing life, with the consciousness of Christian centuries in
its bosom. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) should be dressed as a nun; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) looks
almost what you call a Quaker; I would dress her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) as a nun in my
picture. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) is married; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) wedding-ring on that
wonderful left hand, otherwise I should have thought the sallow
Geistlicher was her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) father. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) a good while
ago, and just now I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) in that magnificent pose. Only think! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
is perhaps rich, and would like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) portrait taken. Ah! it is
no use looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>)--there she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) goes! Let us follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) companion, with a little frown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are singular, Ladislaw. You look struck together. Do you know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Della</b></font>) is married to my cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will Ladislaw,
sauntering down the hall with a preoccupied air, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) German
friend kept at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) side and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! the Geistlicher? He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) looks more like an uncle--a more useful sort
of relation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is not my uncle. I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is my second cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ladislaw/Young/Young Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said
Ladislaw, with some irritation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Schon, schon. Don't be snappish. You are not angry with me for
thinking Mrs. Second-Cousin the most perfect young Madonna I ever saw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry? nonsense. I have only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) once before, for a couple of
minutes, when my cousin introduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Madonna</b></font>) to me, just before I left
England. They were not married then. I didn't know they were coming
to Rome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will go to see them now--you will find out what they have for
an address--since you know the name. Shall we go to the post? And you
could speak about the portrait.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound you, Naumann! I don't know what I shall do. I am not so
brazen as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah! that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish. If you were
an artist, you would think of Mistress Second-Cousin as antique form
animated by Christian sentiment--a sort of Christian Antigone--sensuous
force controlled by spiritual passion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, and that your painting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) was the chief outcome of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>)
existence--the divinity passing into higher completeness and all but
exhausted in the act of covering your bit of canvas. I am amateurish
if you like: I do _not_ think that all the universe is straining
towards the obscure significance of your pictures.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it is, my dear!--so far as it is straining through me, Adolf
Naumann: that stands firm,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the good-natured painter, putting a
hand on Ladislaw's shoulder, and not in the least disturbed by the
unaccountable touch of ill-humor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``See now! My existence
presupposes the existence of the whole universe--does it _not?_ and my
function is to paint--and as a painter I have a conception which is
altogether genialisch, of your great-aunt or second grandmother as a
subject for a picture; therefore, the universe is straining towards
that picture through that particular hook or claw which it puts forth
in the shape of me--not true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how if another claw in the shape of me is straining to thwart
it?--the case is a little less simple then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all: the result of the struggle is the same thing--picture or
no picture--logically.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will could not resist this imperturbable temper, and the cloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
face broke into sunshiny laughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, my friend--you will help?''  (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div>said Naumann, in a hopeful tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; nonsense, Naumann! English ladies are not at everybody's service
as models. And you want to express too much with your painting. You
would only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which
every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And
what is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor
stuff after all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising
them. Language is a finer medium.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, for those who can't paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div>said Naumann. <div class="bookquote">``There you have
perfect right. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The artist</b></font>)</div><p/>The amiable artist carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) sting, but Ladislaw did not choose to
appear stung. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) went on as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had not heard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for beings
vague. After all, the true seeing is within; and painting stares at
you with an insistent imperfection. I feel that especially about
representations of women. As if a woman were a mere colored
superficies! You must wait for movement and tone. There is a
difference in their very breathing: they change from moment to
moment.--This woman whom you have just seen, for example: how would you
paint her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, pray? But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice is much diviner than anything you
have seen of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I see, I see. You are jealous. No man must presume to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
can paint your ideal. This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt!
<div class="bookquote">``Der Neffe als Onkel' in a tragic sense--ungeheuer!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You and I shall quarrel, Naumann, if you call that lady my aunt again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to be called then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. Suppose I get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in spite of you, and find
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) very much wishes to be painted?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, suppose!''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will Ladislaw, in a contemptuous undertone,
intended to dismiss the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was conscious of being irritated
by ridiculously small causes, which were half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own creation. Why
was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) making any fuss about Mrs. Casaubon? And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) felt as if
something had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) with regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). There are characters
which are continually creating collisions and nodes for themselves in
dramas which nobody is prepared to act with them. Their
susceptibilities will clash against objects that remain innocently
quiet.



<p/>CHAPTER XX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A child forsaken, waking suddenly,
Whose gaze afeard on all things round doth rove,
And seeth only that it cannot see
The meeting eyes of love.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Two hours later, Dorothea was seated in an inner room or boudoir of a
handsome apartment in the Via Sistina.

<p/>I am sorry to add that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was sobbing bitterly, with such abandonment
to this relief of an oppressed heart as a woman habitually controlled
by pride on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own account and thoughtfulness for others will
sometimes allow herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels securely alone. And Mr.
Casaubon was certain to remain away for some time at the Vatican.

<p/>Yet Dorothea had no distinctly shapen grievance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could state
even to herself; and in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) confused thought and passion,
the mental act that was struggling forth into clearness was a
self-accusing cry that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feeling of desolation was the fault of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own spiritual poverty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had married the man of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) choice, and with
the advantage over most girls that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had contemplated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage
chiefly as the beginning of new duties: from the very first she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
thought of Mr. Casaubon as having a mind so much above her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
must often be claimed by studies which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not entirely share;
moreover, after the brief narrow experience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) girlhood she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
beholding Rome, the city of visible history, where the past of a whole
hemisphere seems moving in funeral procession with strange ancestral
images and trophies gathered from afar.

<p/>But this stupendous fragmentariness heightened the dreamlike
strangeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bridal life. Dorothea had now been five weeks in
Rome, and in the kindly mornings when autumn and winter seemed to go
hand in hand like a happy aged couple one of whom would presently
survive in chiller loneliness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had driven about at first with Mr.
Casaubon, but of late chiefly with Tantripp and their experienced
courier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been led through the best galleries, had been taken
to the chief points of view, had been shown the grandest ruins and the
most glorious churches, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ended by oftenest choosing to drive
out to the Campagna where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could feel alone with the earth and sky,
away-from the oppressive masquerade of ages, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own life too
seemed to become a masque with enigmatical costumes.

<p/>To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power of a
knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, and
traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, Rome
may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world. But
let them conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic broken
revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly on the
notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and Swiss
Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and on art chiefly of
the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) small
allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) actions into their
mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the
quality of a pleasure or a pain; a girl who had lately become a wife,
and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself
plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) personal lot. The weight
of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs to whom it
formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo-foreign society;
but Dorothea had no such defence against deep impressions. Ruins and
basilicas, palaces and colossi, set in the midst of a sordid present,
where all that was living and warm-blooded seemed sunk in the deep
degeneracy of a superstition divorced from reverence; the dimmer but
yet eager Titanic life gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the
long vistas of white forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold the
monotonous light of an alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious
ideals, sensuous and spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of
breathing forgetfulness and degradation, at first jarred her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) as with an
electric shock, and then urged themselves on her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) with that ache
belonging to a glut of confused ideas which check the flow of emotion.
Forms both pale and glowing took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) young sense, and
fixed themselves in her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) memory even when she (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) was not thinking of them,
preparing strange associations which remained through her (<font color='blue'><b>midst</b></font>) after-years.
Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed each other
like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain states of
dull forlornness Dorothea all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life continued to see the vastness of
St. Peter's, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention in the
attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the mosaics
above, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading
itself everywhere like a disease of the retina.

<p/>Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea's was anything very
exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out among
incongruities and left to <div class="bookquote">``find their feet''  (<font color='red'><b>souls</b></font>)</div>among them, while their
elders go about their business. Nor can I suppose that when Mrs.
Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wedding,
the situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discouragement, some
faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary,
is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what
is not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of
frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of
mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we
had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be
like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we
should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it
is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.

<p/>However, Dorothea was crying, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been required to state the
cause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could only have done so in some such general words as I have
already used: to have been driven to be more particular would have been
like trying to give a history of the lights and shadows, for that new
real future which was replacing the imaginary drew its material from
the endless minutiae by which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) view of Mr. Casaubon and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wifely
relation, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), was gradually changing with
the secret motion of a watch-hand from what it had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) maiden
dream. It was too early yet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fully to recognize or at least
admit the change, still more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to have readjusted that
devotedness which was so necessary a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mental life that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was almost sure sooner or later to recover it. Permanent rebellion,
the disorder of a life without some loving reverent resolve, was not
possible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was now in an interval when the very force of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) nature heightened its confusion. In this way, the early months of
marriage often are times of critical tumult--whether that of a
shrimp-pool or of deeper waters--which afterwards subsides into
cheerful peace.

<p/>But was not Mr. Casaubon just as learned as before? Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) forms of
expression changed, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sentiments become less laudable? Oh
waywardness of womanhood! did his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) chronology fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) ability
to state not only a theory but the names of those who held it; or his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
provision for giving the heads of any subject on demand? And was not
Rome the place in all the world to give free play to such
accomplishments? Besides, had not Dorothea's enthusiasm especially
dwelt on the prospect of relieving the weight and perhaps the sadness
with which great tasks lie on him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) who has to achieve them?-- And that
such weight pressed on Mr. Casaubon was only plainer than before.

<p/>All these are crushing questions; but whatever else remained the same,
the light had changed, and you cannot find the pearly dawn at noonday.
The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are
acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few
imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of
married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than
what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether
the same. And it would be astonishing to find how soon the change is
felt if we had no kindred changes to compare with it. To share
lodgings with a brilliant dinner-companion, or to see your favorite
politician in the Ministry, may bring about changes quite as rapid: in
these cases too we begin by knowing little and believing much, and we
sometimes end by inverting the quantities.

<p/>Still, such comparisons might mislead, for no man was more incapable of
flashy make-believe than Mr. Casaubon: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was as genuine a character as
any ruminant animal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not actively assisted in creating any
illusions about himself. How was it that in the weeks since her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
marriage, Dorothea had not distinctly observed but felt with a stifling
depression, that the large vistas and wide fresh air which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
dreamed of finding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's mind were replaced by anterooms and
winding passages which seemed to lead nowhither? I suppose it was that
in courtship everything is regarded as provisional and preliminary, and
the smallest sample of virtue or accomplishment is taken to guarantee
delightful stores which the broad leisure of marriage will reveal. But
the door-sill of marriage once crossed, expectation is concentrated on
the present. Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is
impossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not
within sight--that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.

<p/>In their conversation before marriage, Mr. Casaubon had often dwelt on
some explanation or questionable detail of which Dorothea did not see
the bearing; but such imperfect coherence seemed due to the brokenness
of their intercourse, and, supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) faith in their future, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had listened with fervid patience to a recitation of possible arguments
to be brought against Mr. Casaubon's entirely new view of the
Philistine god Dagon and other fish-deities, thinking that hereafter
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should see this subject which touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) so nearly from the same
high ground whence doubtless it had become so important to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Again,
the matter-of-course statement and tone of dismissal with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
treated what to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were the most stirring thoughts, was easily
accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste and preoccupation in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself shared during their engagement. But now, since they
had been in Rome, with all the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) emotion roused to
tumultuous activity, and with life made a new problem by new elements,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been becoming more and more aware, with a certain terror, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was continually sliding into inward fits of anger and
repulsion, or else into forlorn weariness. How far the judicious
Hooker or any other hero of erudition would have been the same at Mr.
Casaubon's time of life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had no means of knowing, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could
not have the advantage of comparison; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's way of
commenting on the strangely impressive objects around them had begun to
affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with a sort of mental shiver: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had perhaps the best
intention of acquitting himself worthily, but only of acquitting
himself. What was fresh to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was worn out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); and such
capacity of thought and feeling as had ever been stimulated in him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) by
the general life of mankind had long shrunk to a sort of dried
preparation, a lifeless embalmment of knowledge.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Does this interest you, Dorothea? Shall we stay a
little longer? I am ready to stay if you wish it,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
as if going or staying were alike dreary. Or, <div class="bookquote">``Should you like to go
to the Farnesina, Dorothea? It contains celebrated frescos designed or
painted by Raphael, which most persons think it worth while to visit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But do you care about them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>was always Dorothea's question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are, I believe, highly esteemed. Some of them represent the
fable of Cupid and Psyche, which is probably the romantic invention of
a literary period, and cannot, I think, be reckoned as a genuine
mythical product. But if you like these wall-paintings we can easily
drive thither; and you will then, I think, have seen the chief works of
Raphael, any of which it were a pity to omit in a visit to Rome. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raphael</b></font>) is
the painter who has been held to combine the most complete grace of
form with sublimity of expression. Such at least I have gathered to be
the opinion of cognoscenti.''

 (<font color='red'><b>clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>This kind of answer given in a measured official tone, as of a
clergyman reading according to the rubric, did not help to justify the
glories of the Eternal City, or to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the hope that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew
more about them the world would be joyously illuminated for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). There
is hardly any contact more depressing to a young ardent creature than
that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in
a blank absence of interest or sympathy.

<p/>On other subjects indeed Mr. Casaubon showed a tenacity of occupation
and an eagerness which are usually regarded as the effect of
enthusiasm, and Dorothea was anxious to follow this spontaneous
direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thoughts, instead of being made to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) away from it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was gradually ceasing to expect with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) former delightful confidence that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should see any wide opening
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Poor Mr. Casaubon himself was lost among small
closets and winding stairs, and in an agitated dimness about the
Cabeiri, or in an exposure of other mythologists' ill-considered
parallels, easily lost sight of any purpose which had prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to
these labors. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) taper stuck before him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) forgot the absence of
windows, and in bitter manuscript remarks on other men's notions about
the solar deities, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had become indifferent to the sunlight.

<p/>These characteristics, fixed and unchangeable as bone in Mr. Casaubon,
might have remained longer unfelt by Dorothea if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been
encouraged to pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) girlish and womanly feeling--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would
have held her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands between his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and listened with the delight of
tenderness and understanding to all the little histories which made up
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience, and would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the same sort of intimacy in
return, so that the past life of each could be included in their mutual
knowledge and affection--or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could have fed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) affection with
those childlike caresses which are the bent of every sweet woman, who
has begun by showering kisses on the hard pate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bald doll,
creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
love. That was Dorothea's bent. With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) yearning to know what
was afar from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and to be widely benignant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ardor enough for
what was near, to have kissed Mr. Casaubon's coat-sleeve, or to have
caressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) shoe-latchet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have made any other sign of
acceptance than pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) unfailing propriety, to be of
a most affectionate and truly feminine nature, indicating at the same
time by politely reaching a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) regarded these
manifestations as rather crude and startling. Having made his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) clerical
toilet with due care in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was prepared only for those
amenities of life which were suited to the well-adjusted stiff cravat
of the period, and to a mind weighted with unpublished matter.

<p/>And by a sad contradiction Dorothea's ideas and resolves seemed like
melting ice floating and lost in the warm flood of which they had been
but another form. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was humiliated to find herself a mere victim of
feeling, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could know nothing except through that medium: all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) strength was scattered in fits of agitation, of struggle, of
despondency, and then again in visions of more complete renunciation,
transforming all hard conditions into duty. Poor Dorothea! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
certainly troublesome--to herself chiefly; but this morning for the
first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been troublesome to Mr. Casaubon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had begun, while they were taking coffee, with a determination to
shake off what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inwardly called her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) selfishness, and turned a face
all cheerful attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, ``My dear Dorothea,
we must now think of all that is yet left undone, as a preliminary to
our departure. I would fain have returned home earlier that we might
have been at Lowick for the Christmas; but my inquiries here have been
protracted beyond their anticipated period. I trust, however, that the
time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you. Among the sights of
Europe, that of Rome has ever been held one of the most striking and in
some respects edifying. I well remember that I considered it an epoch
in my life when I visited it for the first time; after the fall of
Napoleon, an event which opened the Continent to travellers. Indeed I
think it is one among several cities to which an extreme hyperbole has
been applied--<div class="bookquote">``See Rome and die:' but in your case I would propose an
emendation and say, See Rome as a bride, and live henceforth as a happy
wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon pronounced this little speech with the most conscientious
intention, blinking a little and swaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head up and down, and
concluding with a smile. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not found marriage a rapturous state,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had no idea of being anything else than an irreproachable
husband, who would make a charming young woman as happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deserved
to be.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you are thoroughly satisfied with our stay--I mean, with the
result so far as your studies are concerned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, trying to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind fixed on what most affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with that peculiar pitch of voice which makes
the word half a negative. <div class="bookquote">``I have been led farther than I had
foreseen, and various subjects for annotation have presented themselves
which, though I have no direct need of them, I could not pretermit.
The task, notwithstanding the assistance of my amanuensis, has been a
somewhat laborious one, but your society has happily prevented me from
that too continuous prosecution of thought beyond the hours of study
which has been the snare of my solitary life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad that my presence has made any difference to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, who had a vivid memory of evenings in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had supposed
that Mr. Casaubon's mind had gone too deep during the day to be able to
get to the surface again. I fear there was a little temper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
reply. <div class="bookquote">``I hope when we get to Lowick, I shall be more useful to you,
and be able to enter a little more into what interests you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with a slight bow. <div class="bookquote">``The notes
I have here made will want sifting, and you can, if you please, extract
them under my direction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all your notes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, whose heart had already burned
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) on this subject, so that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not help speaking
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tongue. <div class="bookquote">``All those rows of volumes--will you not now do what
you used to speak of?--will you not make up your mind what part of them
you will use, and begin to write the book which will make your vast
knowledge useful to the world? I will write to your dictation, or I
will copy and extract what you tell me: I can be of no other use.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea, in a most unaccountable, darkly feminine manner, ended with a
slight sob and eyes full of tears.

<p/>The excessive feeling manifested would alone have been highly
disturbing to Mr. Casaubon, but there were other reasons why Dorothea's
words were among the most cutting and irritating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could
have been impelled to use. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was as blind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) inward troubles as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not yet learned those hidden conflicts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband which claim our pity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not yet listened patiently to
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heartbeats, but only felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own was beating violently. In
Mr. Casaubon's ear, Dorothea's voice gave loud emphatic iteration to
those muffled suggestions of consciousness which it was possible to
explain as mere fancy, the illusion of exaggerated sensitiveness:
always when such suggestions are unmistakably repeated from without,
they are resisted as cruel and unjust. We are angered even by the full
acceptance of our humiliating confessions--how much more by hearing in
hard distinct syllables from the lips of a near observer, those
confused murmurs which we try to call morbid, and strive against as if
they were the oncoming of numbness! And this cruel outward accuser was
there in the shape of a wife--nay, of a young bride, who, instead of
observing his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) abundant pen-scratches and amplitude of paper with the
uncritical awe of an elegant-minded canary-bird, seemed to present
herself as a spy watching everything with a malign power of inference.
Here, towards this particular point of the compass, Mr. Casaubon had a
sensitiveness to match Dorothea's, and an equal quickness to imagine
more than the fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had formerly observed with approbation her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
capacity for worshipping the right object; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) now foresaw with sudden
terror that this capacity might be replaced by presumption, this
worship by the most exasperating of all criticism,--that which sees
vaguely a great many fine ends, and has not the least notion what it
costs to reach them.

<p/>For the first time since Dorothea had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), Mr. Casaubon's face
had a quick angry flush upon it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, with irritation reined in by propriety, <div class="bookquote">``you may
rely upon me for knowing the times and the seasons, adapted to the
different stages of a work which is not to be measured by the facile
conjectures of ignorant onlookers. It had been easy for me to gain a
temporary effect by a mirage of baseless opinion; but it is ever the
trial of the scrupulous explorer to be saluted with the impatient scorn
of chatterers who attempt only the smallest achievements, being indeed
equipped for no other. And it were well if all such could be
admonished to discriminate judgments of which the true subject-matter
lies entirely beyond their reach, from those of which the elements may
be compassed by a narrow and superficial survey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This speech was delivered with an energy and readiness quite unusual
with Mr. Casaubon. It was not indeed entirely an improvisation, but
had taken shape in inward colloquy, and rushed out like the round
grains from a fruit when sudden heat cracks it. Dorothea was not only
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wife: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was a personification of that shallow world which
surrounds the appreciated or desponding author.

<p/>Dorothea was indignant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) turn. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) not been repressing
everything in herself except the desire to enter into some fellowship
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's chief interests?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My judgment _was_ a very superficial one--such as I am capable of
forming,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) answered, with a prompt resentment, that needed no
rehearsal. <div class="bookquote">``You showed me the rows of notebooks--you have often spoken
of them--you have often said that they wanted digesting. But I never
heard you speak of the writing that is to be published. Those were
very simple facts, and my judgment went no farther. I only begged you
to let me be of some good to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea rose to leave the table and Mr. Casaubon made no reply, taking
up a letter which lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as if to reperuse it. Both were
shocked at their mutual situation--that each should have betrayed anger
towards the other. If they had been at home, settled at Lowick in
ordinary life among their neighbors, the clash would have been less
embarrassing: but on a wedding journey, the express object of which is
to isolate two people on the ground that they are all the world to each
other, the sense of disagreement is, to say the least, confounding and
stultifying. To have changed your longitude extensively and placed
yourselves in a moral solitude in order to have small explosions, to
find conversation difficult and to hand a glass of water without
looking, can hardly be regarded as satisfactory fulfilment even to the
toughest minds. To Dorothea's inexperienced sensitiveness, it seemed
like a catastrophe, changing all prospects; and to Mr. Casaubon it was
a new pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) never having been on a wedding journey before, or found
himself in that close union which was more of a subjection than he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had
been able to imagine, since this charming young bride not only obliged
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to much consideration on her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) behalf -LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had sedulously
given-RRB-, but turned out to be capable of agitating him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cruelly just
where he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) most needed soothing. Instead of getting a soft fence against
the cold, shadowy, unapplausive audience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) life, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) only given
it a more substantial presence?

<p/>Neither of them felt it possible to speak again at present. To have
reversed a previous arrangement and declined to go out would have been
a show of persistent anger which Dorothea's conscience shrank from,
seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) already began to feel herself guilty. However just her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
indignation might be, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ideal was not to claim justice, but to give
tenderness. So when the carriage came to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) drove with Mr.
Casaubon to the Vatican, walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) through the stony avenue of
inscriptions, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) parted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) at the entrance to the
Library, went on through the Museum out of mere listlessness as to what
was around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not spirit to turn round and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
would drive anywhere. It was when Mr. Casaubon was quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that
Naumann had first seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) had entered the long gallery of
sculpture at the same time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); but here Naumann had to await
Ladislaw with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) was to settle a bet of champagne about an
enigmatical mediaeval-looking figure there. After they had examined
the figure, and had walked on finishing their dispute, they had parted,
Ladislaw lingering behind while Naumann had gone into the Hall of
Statues where he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) again saw Dorothea, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in that brooding
abstraction which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pose remarkable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not really see the
streak of sunlight on the floor more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw the statues: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
inwardly seeing the light of years to come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own home and over the
English fields and elms and hedge-bordered highroads; and feeling that
the way in which they might be filled with joyful devotedness was not
so clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as it had been. But in Dorothea's mind there was a
current into which all thought and feeling were apt sooner or later to
flow--the reaching forward of the whole consciousness towards the
fullest truth, the least partial good. There was clearly something
better than anger and despondency.



<p/>CHAPTER XXI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hire facounde eke full womanly and plain,
No contrefeted termes had she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
To semen wise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>CHAUCER</b></font>)</div>--CHAUCER.


<p/>It was in that way Dorothea came to be sobbing as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
securely alone. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was presently roused by a knock at the door,
which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hastily dry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes before saying, <div class="bookquote">``Come in.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Tantripp
had brought a card, and said that there was a gentleman waiting in the
lobby. The courier had told him (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) that only Mrs. Casaubon was at home,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>courier</b></font>) was a relation of Mr. Casaubon's: would she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) see him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, without pause; <div class="bookquote">``show him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) into the salon.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
chief impressions about young Ladislaw were that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
at Lowick she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been made aware of Mr. Casaubon's generosity towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and also that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own hesitation about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) career. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was alive to anything that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) an opportunity for
active sympathy, and at this moment it seemed as if the visit had come
to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) self-absorbed discontent--to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's goodness, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had now the right to be
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) helpmate in all kind deeds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) waited a minute or two, but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) passed into the next room there were just signs enough that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
been crying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) open face look more youthful and appealing than
usual. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) met Ladislaw with that exquisite smile of good-will which
is unmixed with vanity, and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was the elder
by several years, but at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) looked much the younger, for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) transparent complexion flushed suddenly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) spoke with a
shyness extremely unlike the ready indifference of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) manner with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
male companion, while Dorothea became all the calmer with a wondering
desire to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) at ease.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not aware that you and Mr. Casaubon were in Rome, until this
morning, when I saw you in the Vatican Museum,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I knew you
at once--but--I mean, that I concluded Mr. Casaubon's address would be
found at the Poste Restante, and I was anxious to pay my respects to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) and you as early as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) is not here now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) will be glad to hear of
you, I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, seating herself unthinkingly between
the fire and the light of the tall window, and pointing to a chair
opposite, with the quietude of a benignant matron. The signs of
girlish sorrow in her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) face were only the more striking. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon
is much engaged; but you will leave your address--will you not?--and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will write to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ladislaw/Young/Young Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Ladislaw, beginning to lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) diffidence in
the interest with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was observing the signs of weeping which had
altered her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``My address is on my card. But if you will allow me
I will call again to-morrow at an hour when Mr. Casaubon is likely to
be at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) goes to read in the Library of the Vatican every day, and you can
hardly see him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) except by an appointment. Especially now. We are about
to leave Rome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is very busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is usually away almost from
breakfast till dinner. But I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will wish you to dine with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Will Ladislaw was struck mute for a few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had never been
fond of Mr. Casaubon, and if it had not been for the sense of
obligation, would have laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as a Bat of erudition. But the
idea of this dried-up pedant, this elaborator of small explanations
about as important as the surplus stock of false antiquities kept in a
vendor's back chamber, having first got this adorable young creature to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and then passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) honeymoon away from her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>), groping after
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mouldy futilities -LRB-Will was given to hyperbole-RRB---this sudden
picture stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) with a sort of comic disgust: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was divided
between the impulse to laugh aloud and the equally unseasonable impulse
to burst into scornful invective.

<p/>For an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) felt that the struggle, was causing a queer
contortion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mobile features, but with a good effort he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) resolved
it into nothing more offensive than a merry smile.

<p/>Dorothea wondered; but the smile was irresistible, and shone back from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face too. Will Ladislaw's smile was delightful, unless you were
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) beforehand: it was a gush of inward light illuminating
the transparent skin as well as the eyes, and playing about every curve
and line as if some Ariel were touching them with a new charm, and
banishing forever the traces of moodiness. The reflection of that
smile could not but have a little merriment in it too, even under dark
eyelashes still moist, as Dorothea said inquiringly, <div class="bookquote">``Something amuses
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, quick in finding resources. <div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of the
sort of figure I cut the first time I saw you, when you annihilated my
poor sketch with your criticism.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My criticism?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, wondering still more. <div class="bookquote">``Surely not. I
always feel particularly ignorant about painting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspected you of knowing so much, that you knew how to say just what
was most cutting. You said--I dare say you don't remember it as I
do--that the relation of my sketch to nature was quite hidden from you.
At least, you implied that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will could laugh now as well as smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was really my ignorance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, admiring
Will's good-humor. <div class="bookquote">``I must have said so only because I never could see
any beauty in the pictures which my uncle told me all judges thought
very fine. And I have gone about with just the same ignorance in Rome.
There are comparatively few paintings that I can really enjoy. At
first when I enter a room where the walls are covered with frescos, or
with rare pictures, I feel a kind of awe--like a child present at great
ceremonies where there are grand robes and processions; I feel myself
in the presence of some higher life than my own. But when I begin to
examine the pictures one by one the life goes out of them, or else is
something violent and strange to me. It must be my own dulness. I am
seeing so much all at once, and not understanding half of it. That
always makes one feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything
is very fine and not be able to feel that it is fine--something like
being blind, while people talk of the sky.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be
acquired,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. -LRB-It was impossible now to doubt the directness
of Dorothea's confession.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Art is an old language with a great many
artificial affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets
out of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing. I enjoy the art of
all sorts here immensely; but I suppose if I could pick my enjoyment to
pieces I should find it made up of many different threads. There is
something in daubing a little one's self, and having an idea of the
process.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean perhaps to be a painter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with a new direction
of interest. <div class="bookquote">``You mean to make painting your profession? Mr. Casaubon
will like to hear that you have chosen a profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, with some coldness. <div class="bookquote">``I have quite made up my
mind against it. It is too one-sided a life. I have been seeing a
great deal of the German artists here: I travelled from Frankfort with
one of them. Some are fine, even brilliant fellows--but I should not
like to get into their way of looking at the world entirely from the
studio point of view.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I can understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, cordially. <div class="bookquote">``And in Rome it
seems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the
world than pictures. But if you have a genius for painting, would it
not be right to take that as a guide? Perhaps you might do better
things than these--or different, so that there might not be so many
pictures almost all alike in the same place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no mistaking this simplicity, and Will was won by it into
frankness. <div class="bookquote">``A man must have a very rare genius to make changes of that
sort. I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing
well what has been done already, at least not so well as to make it
worth while. And I should never succeed in anything by dint of
drudgery. If things don't come easily to me I never get them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard Mr. Casaubon say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) regrets your want of patience,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, gently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was rather shocked at this mode of taking
all life as a holiday.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know Mr. Casaubon's opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and I differ.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The slight streak of contempt in this hasty reply offended Dorothea.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was all the more susceptible about Mr. Casaubon because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
morning's trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly you differ,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, rather proudly. <div class="bookquote">``I did not think of
comparing you: such power of persevering devoted labor as Mr.
Casaubon's is not common.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Will saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was offended, but this only gave an additional
impulse to the new irritation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) latent dislike towards Mr.
Casaubon. It was too intolerable that Dorothea should be worshipping
this husband: such weakness in a woman is pleasant to no man but the
husband in question. Mortals are easily tempted to pinch the life out
of their neighbor's buzzing glory, and think that such killing is no
murder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) answered, promptly. <div class="bookquote">``And therefore it is a pity that
it should be thrown away, as so much English scholarship is, for want
of knowing what is being done by the rest of the world. If Mr.
Casaubon read German he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would save himself a great deal of trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, startled and anxious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I merely mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, in an offhand way, <div class="bookquote">``that the Germans have
taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which
are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have
made good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) deafened
himself in that direction: it was almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) read
a Latin treatise written by a German. I was very sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Will only thought of giving a good pinch that would annihilate that
vaunted laboriousness, and was unable to imagine the mode in which
Dorothea would be wounded. Young Mr. Ladislaw was not at all deep
himself in German writers; but very little achievement is required in
order to pity another man's shortcomings.

<p/>Poor Dorothea felt a pang at the thought that the labor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's life might be void, which left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) no energy to spare for the
question whether this young relative who was so much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ought not to have repressed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) observation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not even speak,
but sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands, absorbed in the piteousness of that
thought.

<p/>Will, however, having given that annihilating pinch, was rather
ashamed, imagining from Dorothea's silence that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had offended her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
still more; and having also a conscience about plucking the
tail-feathers from a benefactor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I regretted it especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) resumed, taking the usual course from
detraction to insincere eulogy, <div class="bookquote">``because of my gratitude and respect
towards my cousin. It would not signify so much in a man whose talents
and character were less distinguished.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes, brighter than usual with excited feeling, and
said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saddest recitative, <div class="bookquote">``How I wish I had learned German when I
was at Lausanne! There were plenty of German teachers. But now I can
be of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a new light, but still a mysterious light, for Will in
Dorothea's last words. The question how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had come to accept Mr.
Casaubon--which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had dismissed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) by saying that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must be disagreeable in spite of appearances--was not now to be
answered on any such short and easy method. Whatever else she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might
be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not disagreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not coldly clever and indirectly
satirical, but adorably simple and full of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was an angel
beguiled. It would be a unique delight to wait and watch for the
melodious fragments in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart and soul came forth so directly
and ingenuously. The Aeolian harp again came into his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must have made some original romance for herself in this marriage.
And if Mr. Casaubon had been a dragon who had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
lair with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) talons simply and without legal forms, it would have been
an unavoidable feat of heroism to release her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and fall at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feet.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was something more unmanageable than a dragon: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was a
benefactor with collective society at his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was at that
moment entering the room in all the unimpeachable correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
demeanor, while Dorothea was looking animated with a newly roused alarm
and regret, and Will was looking animated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) admiring speculation
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon felt a surprise which was quite unmixed with pleasure, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not swerve from his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) usual politeness of greeting, when Will rose
and explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) presence. Mr. Casaubon was less happy than usual,
and this perhaps made him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) look all the dimmer and more faded; else, the
effect might easily have been produced by the contrast of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) young
cousin's appearance. The first impression on seeing Will was one of
sunny brightness, which added to the uncertainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) changing
expression. Surely, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) very features changed their form, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) jaw
looked sometimes large and sometimes small; and the little ripple in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) nose was a preparation for metamorphosis. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head
quickly his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hair seemed to shake out light, and some persons thought
they saw decided genius in this coruscation. Mr. Casaubon, on the
contrary, stood rayless.

<p/>As Dorothea's eyes were turned anxiously on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was perhaps
not insensible to the contrast, but it was only mingled with other
causes in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more conscious of that new alarm on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) behalf
which was the first stirring of a pitying tenderness fed by the
realities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) lot and not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own dreams. Yet it was a source of
greater freedom to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that Will was there; his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) young equality was
agreeable, and also perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) openness to conviction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt an
immense need of some one to speak to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never before seen any
one who seemed so quick and pliable, so likely to understand everything.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon gravely hoped that Will was passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) time profitably as
well as pleasantly in Rome--had thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) intention was to remain in
South Germany--but begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to come and dine to-morrow, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could
converse more at large: at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was somewhat weary. Ladislaw
understood, and accepting the invitation immediately took his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) leave.

<p/>Dorothea's eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband anxiously, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) sank down
wearily at the end of a sofa, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) elbow supported his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) head
and looked on the floor. A little flushed, and with bright eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
seated herself beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me for speaking so hastily to you this morning. I was wrong.
I fear I hurt you and made the day more burdensome.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad that you feel that, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) spoke
quietly and bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head a little, but there was still an uneasy
feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do forgive me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with a quick sob. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) need
for some manifestation of feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was ready to exaggerate her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
fault. Would not love see returning penitence afar off, and fall on
its neck and kiss it?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Dorothea--`who with repentance is not satisfied, is not of
heaven nor earth:'--you do not think me worthy to be banished by that
severe sentence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, exerting himself to make a strong
statement, and also to smile faintly.

<p/>Dorothea was silent, but a tear which had come up with the sob would
insist on falling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are excited, my dear. And I also am feeling some unpleasant
consequences of too much mental disturbance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon. In
fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thought to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ought not to have
received young Ladislaw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) absence: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) abstained, partly from
the sense that it would be ungracious to bring a new complaint in the
moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) penitent acknowledgment, partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) wanted to
avoid further agitation of himself by speech, and partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was
too proud to betray that jealousy of disposition which was not so
exhausted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) scholarly compeers that there was none to spare in
other directions. There is a sort of jealousy which needs very little
fire: it is hardly a passion, but a blight bred in the cloudy, damp
despondency of uneasy egoism.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it is time for us to dress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) added, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) watch.
They both rose, and there was never any further allusion between them
to what had passed on this day.

<p/>But Dorothea remembered it to the last with the vividness with which we
all remember epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies,
or some new motive is born. Today she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had begun to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feeling from
Mr. Casaubon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had felt the waking of a presentiment that there
might be a sad consciousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) life which made as great a need on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) side as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own.

<p/>We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder
to feed our supreme selves: Dorothea had early begun to emerge from
that stupidity, but yet it had been easier to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to imagine how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
would devote herself to Mr. Casaubon, and become wise and strong in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
strength and wisdom, than to conceive with that distinctness which is
no longer reflection but feeling--an idea wrought back to the
directness of sense, like the solidity of objects--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had an
equivalent centre of self, whence the lights and shadows must always
fall with a certain difference.



<p/>CHAPTER XXII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nous câusames longtemps; elle était simple et bonne.
Ne sachant pas le mal, elle faisait le bien;
Des richesses du coeur elle me fit l'aumône,
Et tout en écoutant comme le coeur se donne,
Sans oser y penser je lui donnai le mien;
Elle emporta ma vie, et n'en sut jamais rien.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--ALFRED DE MUSSET.


<p/>Will Ladislaw was delightfully agreeable at dinner the next day, and
gave no opportunity for Mr. Casaubon to show disapprobation. On the
contrary it seemed to Dorothea that Will had a happier way of drawing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband into conversation and of deferentially listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ever observed in any one before. To be sure, the
listeners about Tipton were not highly gifted! Will talked a good deal
himself, but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) said was thrown in with such rapidity, and with
such an unimportant air of saying something by the way, that it seemed
a gay little chime after the great bell. If Will was not always
perfect, this was certainly one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) good days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) described touches
of incident among the poor people in Rome, only to be seen by one who
could move about freely; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) found himself in agreement with Mr.
Casaubon as to the unsound opinions of Middleton concerning the
relations of Judaism and Catholicism; and passed easily to a
half-enthusiastic half-playful picture of the enjoyment he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) got out of
the very miscellaneousness of Rome, which made the mind flexible with
constant comparison, and saved you from seeing the world's ages as a
set of box-like partitions without vital connection. Mr. Casaubon's
studies, Will observed, had always been of too broad a kind for that,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had perhaps never felt any such sudden effect, but for himself
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) confessed that Rome had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) quite a new sense of history as a
whole: the fragments stimulated his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) imagination and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
constructive. Then occasionally, but not too often, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) appealed to
Dorothea, and discussed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sentiment were an item
to be considered in the final judgment even of the Madonna di Foligno
or the Laocoon. A sense of contributing to form the world's opinion
makes conversation particularly cheerful; and Mr. Casaubon too was not
without his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) young wife, who spoke better than most women,
as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had perceived in choosing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).

<p/>Since things were going on so pleasantly, Mr. Casaubon's statement that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) labors in the Library would be suspended for a couple of days, and
that after a brief renewal he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should have no further reason for staying
in Rome, encouraged Will to urge that Mrs. Casaubon should not go away
without seeing a studio or two. Would not Mr. Casaubon take her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)? That
sort of thing ought not to be missed: it was quite special: it was a
form of life that grew like a small fresh vegetation with its
population of insects on huge fossils. Will would be happy to conduct
them--not to anything wearisome, only to a few examples.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon, seeing Dorothea look earnestly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), could not but
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would be interested in such visits: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was now at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
service during the whole day; and it was agreed that Will should come
on the morrow and drive with them.

<p/>Will could not omit Thorwaldsen, a living celebrity about whom even Mr.
Casaubon inquired, but before the day was far advanced he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) led the way
to the studio of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) friend Adolf Naumann, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mentioned as one of
the chief renovators of Christian art, one of those who had not only
revived but expanded that grand conception of supreme events as
mysteries at which the successive ages were spectators, and in relation
to which the great souls of all periods became as it were
contemporaries. Will added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had made himself Naumann's pupil
for the nonce.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been making some oil-sketches under him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``I hate
copying. I must put something of my own in. Naumann has been painting
the Saints drawing the Car of the Church, and I have been making a
sketch of Marlowe's Tamburlaine Driving the Conquered Kings in his (<font color='blue'><b>Marlowe</b></font>)
Chariot. I am not so ecclesiastical as Naumann, and I sometimes twit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) excess of meaning. But this time I mean to outdo him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) in
breadth of intention. I take Tamburlaine in his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) chariot for the
tremendous course of the world's physical history lashing on the
harnessed dynasties. In my opinion, that is a good mythical
interpretation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>Will here looked at Mr. Casaubon, who received this
offhand treatment of symbolism very uneasily, and bowed with a neutral
air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The sketch must be very grand, if it conveys so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.
<div class="bookquote">``I should need some explanation even of the meaning you give. Do you
intend Tamburlaine to represent earthquakes and volcanoes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``and migrations of races and clearings
of forests--and America and the steam-engine. Everything you can
imagine!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a difficult kind of shorthand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, smiling towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``It would require all your knowledge to be able to read
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon blinked furtively at Will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had a suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was
being laughed at. But it was not possible to include Dorothea in the
suspicion.

<p/>They found Naumann painting industriously, but no model was present;
his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) pictures were advantageously arranged, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) own plain vivacious
person set off by a dove-colored blouse and a maroon velvet cap, so
that everything was as fortunate as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) had expected the beautiful
young English lady exactly at that time.

<p/>The painter in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) confident English gave little dissertations on his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)
finished and unfinished subjects, seeming to observe Mr. Casaubon as
much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did Dorothea. Will burst in here and there with ardent
words of praise, marking out particular merits in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) friend's work;
and Dorothea felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was getting quite new notions as to the
significance of Madonnas seated under inexplicable canopied thrones
with the simple country as a background, and of saints with
architectural models in their hands, or knives accidentally wedged in
their skulls. Some things which had seemed monstrous to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were
gathering intelligibility and even a natural meaning: but all this was
apparently a branch of knowledge in which Mr. Casaubon had not
interested himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I would rather feel that painting is beautiful than have to
read it as an enigma; but I should learn to understand these pictures
sooner than yours with the very wide meaning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, speaking
to Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of my painting before Naumann,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) will tell
you, it is all pfuscherei, which is his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) most opprobrious word!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sincere eyes on Naumann, who
made a slight grimace and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) does not mean it seriously with painting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) walk must be
belles-lettres. That is wi-ide.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div><p/>Naumann's pronunciation of the vowel seemed to stretch the word
satirically. Will did not half like it, but managed to laugh: and Mr.
Casaubon, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) felt some disgust at the artist's German accent,
began to entertain a little respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) judicious severity.

<p/>The respect was not diminished when Naumann, after drawing Will aside
for a moment and looking, first at a large canvas, then at Mr.
Casaubon, came forward again and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Ladislaw thinks you will pardon me, sir, if I say that a
sketch of your head would be invaluable to me for the St. Thomas
Aquinas in my picture there. It is too much to ask; but I so seldom
see just what I want--the idealistic in the real.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You astonish me greatly, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looks improved
with a glow of delight; <div class="bookquote">``but if my poor physiognomy, which I have been
accustomed to regard as of the commonest order, can be of any use to
you in furnishing some traits for the angelical doctor, I shall feel
honored. That is to say, if the operation will not be a lengthy one;
and if Mrs. Casaubon will not object to the delay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>As for Dorothea, nothing could have pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more, unless it had
been a miraculous voice pronouncing Mr. Casaubon the wisest and
worthiest among the sons of men. In that case her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tottering faith
would have become firm again.

<p/>Naumann's apparatus was at hand in wonderful completeness, and the
sketch went on at once as well as the conversation. Dorothea sat down
and subsided into calm silence, feeling happier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had done for a
long while before. Every one about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seemed good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to
herself that Rome, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had only been less ignorant, would have been
full of beauty: its sadness would have been winged with hope. No nature
could be less suspicious than hers: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was a child she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) believed
in the gratitude of wasps and the honorable susceptibility of sparrows,
and was proportionately indignant when their baseness was made manifest.

<p/>The adroit artist was asking Mr. Casaubon questions about English
polities, which brought long answers, and, Will meanwhile had perched
himself on some steps in the background overlooking all.

<p/>Presently Naumann said--<div class="bookquote">``Now if I could lay this by for half an hour
and take it up again--come and look, Ladislaw--I think it is perfect so
far.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div><p/>Will vented those adjuring interjections which imply that admiration is
too strong for syntax; and Naumann said in a tone of piteous regret--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah--now--if I could but have had more--but you have other
engagements--I could not ask it--or even to come again to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, let us stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``We have nothing to do to-day except
go about, have we?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, looking entreatingly at Mr. Casaubon.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be a pity not to make the head as good as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am at your service, sir, in the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with
polite condescension. <div class="bookquote">``Having given up the interior of my head to
idleness, it is as well that the exterior should work in this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are unspeakably good--now I am happy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div>said Naumann, and then went
on in German to Will, pointing here and there to the sketch as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>)
were considering that. Putting it aside for a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) looked round
vaguely, as if seeking some occupation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) visitors, and afterwards
turning to Mr. Casaubon, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the beautiful bride, the gracious lady, would not be unwilling
to let me fill up the time by trying to make a slight sketch of
her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)--not, of course, as you see, for that picture--only as a single
study.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon, bowing, doubted not that Mrs. Casaubon would oblige him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),
and Dorothea said, at once, <div class="bookquote">``Where shall I put myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Naumann was all apologies in asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to stand, and allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) to
adjust her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attitude, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) submitted without any of the affected
airs and laughs frequently thought necessary on such occasions, when
the painter said, <div class="bookquote">``It is as Santa Clara that I want you to
stand--leaning so, with your cheek against your hand--so--looking at
that stool, please, so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was divided between the inclination to fall at the Saint's feet
and kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) robe, and the temptation to knock Naumann down while he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>)
was adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arm. All this was impudence and desecration, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>)
repented that he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>The artist was diligent, and Will recovering himself moved about and
occupied Mr. Casaubon as ingeniously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not in the
end prevent the time from seeming long to that gentleman, as was clear
from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) expressing a fear that Mrs. Casaubon would be tired. Naumann
took the hint and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, if you can oblige me again; I will release the lady-wife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mr. Casaubon's patience held out further, and when after all it
turned out that the head of Saint Thomas Aquinas would be more perfect
if another sitting could be had, it was granted for the morrow. On the
morrow Santa Clara too was retouched more than once. The result of all
was so far from displeasing to Mr. Casaubon, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) arranged for the
purchase of the picture in which Saint Thomas Aquinas sat among the
doctors of the Church in a disputation too abstract to be represented,
but listened to with more or less attention by an audience above. The
Santa Clara, which was spoken of in the second place, Naumann declared
himself to be dissatisfied with--he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) could not, in conscience, engage
to make a worthy picture of it; so about the Santa Clara the
arrangement was conditional.

<p/>I will not dwell on Naumann's jokes at the expense of Mr. Casaubon that
evening, or on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dithyrambs about Dorothea's charm, in all which Will
joined, but with a difference. No sooner did Naumann mention any
detail of Dorothea's beauty, than Will got exasperated at his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>)
presumption: there was grossness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) choice of the most ordinary
words, and what business had he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lips? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not a
woman to be spoken of as other women were. Will could not say just
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) thought, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) became irritable. And yet, when after some
resistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) had consented to take the Casaubons to his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) friend's
studio, he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) had been allured by the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) pride in being
the person who could grant Naumann such an opportunity of studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
loveliness--or rather her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) divineness, for the ordinary phrases which
might apply to mere bodily prettiness were not applicable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).
-LRB-Certainly all Tipton and its neighborhood, as well as Dorothea
herself, would have been surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) beauty being made so much of.
In that part of the world Miss Brooke had been only a <div class="bookquote">``fine young
woman.'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Brooke/MISS BROOKE/Brooke</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oblige me by letting the subject drop, Naumann. Mrs. Casaubon is not
to be talked of as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were a model,''  (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div>said Will. Naumann stared at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Schon! I will talk of my Aquinas. The head is not a bad type, after
all. I dare say the great scholastic himself would have been flattered
to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Schon</b></font>) portrait asked for. Nothing like these starchy doctors for
vanity! It was as I thought: he (<font color='blue'><b>Schon</b></font>) cared much less for her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) portrait than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Schon</b></font>) own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Schon</b></font>)'s a cursed white-blooded pedantic coxcomb,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, with
gnashing impetuosity. His (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) obligations to Mr. Casaubon were not known
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hearer, but Will himself was thinking of them, and wishing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could discharge them all by a check.

<p/>Naumann gave a shrug and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is good they go away soon, my dear.
They are spoiling your fine temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Naumann/Adolf Naumann</b></font>)</div><p/>All Will's hope and contrivance were now concentrated on seeing
Dorothea when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) only wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to take more emphatic
notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) only wanted to be something more special in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
remembrance than he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) could yet believe himself likely to be. He (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) was
rather impatient under that open ardent good-will, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) saw was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
usual state of feeling. The remote worship of a woman throned out of
their reach plays a great part in men's lives, but in most cases the
worshipper longs for some queenly recognition, some approving sign by
which his (<font color='blue'><b>worshipper</b></font>) soul's sovereign may cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>worshipper</b></font>) without descending from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
high place. That was precisely what Will wanted. But there were
plenty of contradictions in his (<font color='blue'><b>worshipper</b></font>) imaginative demands. It was beautiful
to see how Dorothea's eyes turned with wifely anxiety and beseeching to
Mr. Casaubon: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have lost some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) halo if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been
without that duteous preoccupation; and yet at the next moment the
husband's sandy absorption of such nectar was too intolerable; and
Will's longing to say damaging things about him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was perhaps not the
less tormenting because he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt the strongest reasons for restraining
it.

<p/>Will had not been invited to dine the next day. Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) persuaded
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was bound to call, and that the only eligible time was
the middle of the day, when Mr. Casaubon would not be at home.

<p/>Dorothea, who had not been made aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) former reception of Will
had displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, had no hesitation about seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be come to pay a farewell visit. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
entered she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking at some cameos which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been buying for
Celia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) greeted Will as if his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) visit were quite a matter of course,
and said at once, having a cameo bracelet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so glad you are come. Perhaps you understand all about cameos,
and can tell me if these are really good. I wished to have you with us
in choosing them, but Mr. Casaubon objected: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thought there was not
time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) work to-morrow, and we shall go away in three
days. I have been uneasy about these cameos. Pray sit down and look
at them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not particularly knowing, but there can be no great mistake about
these little Homeric bits: they are exquisitely neat. And the color is
fine: it will just suit you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion. You
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with me at Lowick: she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is light-haired and very pretty--at
least I think so. We were never so long away from each other in our
lives before. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a great pet and never was naughty in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life. I
found out before I came away that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted me to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) some cameos,
and I should be sorry for them not to be good--after their kind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea added the last words with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem not to care about cameos,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, seating himself at some
distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) closed the cases.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, frankly, I don't think them a great object in life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are a heretic about art generally. How is that? I should
have expected you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I am dull about many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, simply. <div class="bookquote">``I
should like to make life beautiful--I mean everybody's life. And then
all this immense expense of art, that seems somehow to lie outside life
and make it no better for the world, pains one. It spoils my enjoyment
of anything when I am made to think that most people are shut out from
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call that the fanaticism of sympathy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, impetuously. <div class="bookquote">``You
might say the same of landscape, of poetry, of all refinement. If you
carried it out you ought to be miserable in your own goodness, and turn
evil that you might have no advantage over others. The best piety is
to enjoy--when you can. You are doing the most then to save the
earth's character as an agreeable planet. And enjoyment radiates. It
is of no use to try and take care of all the world; that is being taken
care of when you feel delight--in art or in anything else. Would you
turn all the youth of the world into a tragic chorus, wailing and
moralizing over misery? I suspect that you have some false belief in
the virtues of misery, and want to make your life a martyrdom.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Will
had gone further than he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) intended, and checked himself. But Dorothea's
thought was not taking just the same direction as his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
answered without any special emotion--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you mistake me. I am not a sad, melancholy creature. I am
never unhappy long together. I am angry and naughty--not like Celia: I
have a great outburst, and then all seems glorious again. I cannot
help believing in glorious things in a blind sort of way. I should be
quite willing to enjoy the art here, but there is so much that I don't
know the reason of--so much that seems to me a consecration of ugliness
rather than beauty. The painting and sculpture may be wonderful, but
the feeling is often low and brutal, and sometimes even ridiculous.
Here and there I see what takes me at once as noble--something that I
might compare with the Alban Mountains or the sunset from the Pincian
Hill; but that makes it the greater pity that there is so little of the
best kind among all that mass of things over which men have toiled so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course there is always a great deal of poor work: the rarer things
want that soil to grow in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, taking up that thought into the chief current
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anxiety; <div class="bookquote">``I see it must be very difficult to do anything good.
I have often felt since I have been in Rome that most of our lives
would look much uglier and more bungling than the pictures, if they
could be put on the wall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea parted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lips again as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were going to say more, but
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind and paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are too young--it is an anachronism for you to have such
thoughts,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Will, energetically, with a quick shake of the head
habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You talk as if you had never known any youth. It is
monstrous--as if you had had a vision of Hades in your childhood, like
the boy in the legend. You have been brought up in some of those
horrible notions that choose the sweetest women to devour--like
Minotaurs. And now you will go and be shut up in that stone prison at
Lowick: you will be buried alive. It makes me savage to think of it!
I would rather never have seen you than think of you with such a
prospect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will again feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had gone too far; but the meaning we attach
to words depends on our feeling, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) tone of angry regret had so
much kindness in it for Dorothea's heart, which had always been giving
out ardor and had never been fed with much from the living beings
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt a new sense of gratitude and answered with a
gentle smile--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very good of you to be anxious about me. It is because you did
not like Lowick yourself: you had set your heart on another kind of
life. But Lowick is my chosen home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The last sentence was spoken with an almost solemn cadence, and Will
did not know what to say, since it would not be useful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to
embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) slippers, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would die for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): it was
clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) required nothing of the sort; and they were both silent
for a moment or two, when Dorothea began again with an air of saying at
last what had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind beforehand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you again about something you said the other day.
Perhaps it was half of it your lively way of speaking: I notice that
you like to put things strongly; I myself often exaggerate when I speak
hastily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, observing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke with a timidity
quite new in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I have a hyperbolical tongue: it catches fire as it
goes. I dare say I shall have to retract.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean what you said about the necessity of knowing German--I mean,
for the subjects that Mr. Casaubon is engaged in. I have been thinking
about it; and it seems to me that with Mr. Casaubon's learning he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must
have before him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) the same materials as German scholars--has he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea's timidity was due to an indistinct consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
in the strange situation of consulting a third person about the
adequacy of Mr. Casaubon's learning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not exactly the same materials,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would be
duly reserved. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is not an Orientalist, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) does not
profess to have more than second-hand knowledge there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there are very valuable books about antiquities which were written
a long while ago by scholars who knew nothing about these modern
things; and they are still used. Why should Mr. Casaubon's not be
valuable, like theirs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with more remonstrant energy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was impelled to have the argument aloud, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been having
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on the line of study taken,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, also getting a
tone of rejoinder. <div class="bookquote">``The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing
as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view.
Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to
refute Paracelsus? Do you not see that it is no use now to be crawling
a little way after men of the last century--men like Bryant--and
correcting their mistakes?--living in a lumber-room and furbishing up
broken-legged theories about Chus and Mizraim?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you bear to speak so lightly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with a look
between sorrow and anger. <div class="bookquote">``If it were as you say, what could be sadder
than so much ardent labor all in vain? I wonder it does not affect you
more painfully, if you really think that a man like Mr. Casaubon, of so
much goodness, power, and learning, should in any way fail in what has
been the labor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) best years.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was beginning to be shocked that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had got to such a point of supposition, and indignant with Will for
having led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You questioned me about the matter of fact, not of feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said
Will. <div class="bookquote">``But if you wish to punish me for the fact, I submit. I am not
in a position to express my feeling toward Mr. Casaubon: it would be at
best a pensioner's eulogy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, coloring deeply. <div class="bookquote">``I am aware, as you
say, that I am in fault in having introduced the subject. Indeed, I am
wrong altogether. Failure after long perseverance is much grander than
never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, determined to change the
situation--<div class="bookquote">``so much so that I have made up my mind not to run that
risk of never attaining a failure. Mr. Casaubon's generosity has
perhaps been dangerous to me, and I mean to renounce the liberty it has
given me. I mean to go back to England shortly and work my own
way--depend on nobody else than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is fine--I respect that feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with returning
kindness. <div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Casaubon, I am sure, has never thought of anything
in the matter except what was most for your welfare.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has obstinacy and pride enough to serve instead of love, now she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
has married him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will to himself. Aloud he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said, rising--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not see you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, stay till Mr. Casaubon comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I am so
glad we met in Rome. I wanted to know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I have made you angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``I have made you think ill of
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no. My sister tells me I am always angry with people who do not
say just what I like. But I hope I am not given to think ill of them.
In the end I am usually obliged to think ill of myself for being so
impatient.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, you don't like me; I have made myself an unpleasant thought to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with the most open kindness. <div class="bookquote">``I like you
very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was not quite contented, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would apparently have
been of more importance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had been disliked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said nothing, but
looked dull, not to say sulky.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am quite interested to see what you will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea went on
cheerfully. <div class="bookquote">``I believe devoutly in a natural difference of vocation.
If it were not for that belief, I suppose I should be very narrow--there
are so many things, besides painting, that I am quite ignorant
of. You would hardly believe how little I have taken in of music and
literature, which you know so much of. I wonder what your vocation
will turn out to be: perhaps you will be a poet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends. To be a poet is to have a soul so quick to discern that
no shade of quality escapes it, and so quick to feel, that discernment
is but a hand playing with finely ordered variety on the chords of
emotion--a soul in which knowledge passes instantaneously into feeling,
and feeling flashes back as a new organ of knowledge. One may have
that condition by fits only.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you leave out the poems,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I think they are wanted
to complete the poet. I understand what you mean about knowledge
passing into feeling, for that seems to be just what I experience. But
I am sure I could never produce a poem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You _are_ a poem--and that is to be the best part of a poet--what
makes up the poet's consciousness in his (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) best moods,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will,
showing such originality as we all share with the morning and the
spring-time and other endless renewals.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, laughing out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) words in a
bird-like modulation, and looking at Will with playful gratitude in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``What very kind things you say to me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could ever do anything that would be what you call kind--that
I could ever be of the slightest service to you. I fear I shall never
have the opportunity.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will spoke with fervor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, cordially. <div class="bookquote">``It will come; and I shall
remember how well you wish me. I quite hoped that we should be friends
when I first saw you--because of your relationship to Mr. Casaubon.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>There was a certain liquid brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes, and Will was
conscious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own were obeying a law of nature and filling too.
The allusion to Mr. Casaubon would have spoiled all if anything at that
moment could have spoiled the subduing power, the sweet dignity, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
noble unsuspicious inexperience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And there is one thing even now that you can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
rising and walking a little way under the strength of a recurring
impulse. <div class="bookquote">``Promise me that you will not again, to any one, speak of
that subject--I mean about Mr. Casaubon's writings--I mean in that
kind of way. It was I who led to it. It was my fault. But promise
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) brief pacing and stood opposite Will, looking
gravely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, I will promise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, reddening however. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
never said a cutting word about Mr. Casaubon again and left off
receiving favors from him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), it would clearly be permissible to hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
the more. The poet must know how to hate, says Goethe; and Will was at
least ready with that accomplishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) must go now
without waiting for Mr. Casaubon, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would come to take leave of
at the last moment. Dorothea gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand, and they exchanged a
simple <div class="bookquote">``Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But going out of the porte cochere he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) met Mr. Casaubon, and that
gentleman, expressing the best wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cousin, politely waived
the pleasure of any further leave-taking on the morrow, which would be
sufficiently crowded with the preparations for departure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you about our cousin Mr. Ladislaw, which I
think will heighten your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband
in the coarse of the evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had mentioned immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
entering that Will had just gone away, and would come again, but Mr.
Casaubon had said, <div class="bookquote">``I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) outside, and we made our final adieux, I
believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>saying this with the air and tone by which we imply that any
subject, whether private or public, does not interest us enough to wish
for a further remark upon it. So Dorothea had waited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that, my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div>said Mr Casaubon -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) always said <div class="bookquote">``my love''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) manner was the coldest-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mind to leave off wandering at once, and to give up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) dependence on your generosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) means soon to go back to
England, and work his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own way. I thought you would consider that a
good sign,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with an appealing look into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
neutral face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mention the precise order of occupation to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would
addict himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) felt the danger which lay for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) in your
generosity. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) will write to you about it. Do you not think
better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) resolve?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall await his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) communication on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) I was sure that the thing you considered in all you did for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own welfare. I remembered your goodness in what you said
about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) at Lowick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a duty towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) other hand on
Dorothea's in conscientious acceptance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) caress, but with a glance
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could not hinder from being uneasy. <div class="bookquote">``The young man, I
confess, is not otherwise an object of interest to me, nor need we, I
think, discuss his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future course, which it is not ours to determine
beyond the limits which I have sufficiently indicated.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea did
not mention Will again.





<p/>BOOK III.





<p/>WAITING FOR DEATH.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your horses of the Sun,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said,
<div class="bookquote">``And first-rate whip Apollo!
Whate'er they be, I'll eat my head,
But I will beat them hollow.''


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred Vincy, we have seen, had a debt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) mind, and though no such
immaterial burthen could depress that buoyant-hearted young gentleman
for many hours together, there were circumstances connected with this
debt which made the thought of it unusually importunate. The creditor
was Mr. Bambridge a horse-dealer of the neighborhood, whose company was
much sought in Middlemarch by young men understood to be <div class="bookquote">``addicted to
pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>During the vacations Fred had naturally required more
amusements than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had ready money for, and Mr. Bambridge had been
accommodating enough not only to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) for the hire of horses and
the accidental expense of ruining a fine hunter, but also to make a
small advance by which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) might be able to meet some losses at
billiards. The total debt was a hundred and sixty pounds. Bambridge
was in no alarm about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) money, being sure that young Vincy had
backers; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had required something to show for it, and Fred had at
first given a bill with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own signature. Three months later he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had
renewed this bill with the signature of Caleb Garth. On both occasions
Fred had felt confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should meet the bill himself, having
ample funds at disposal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own hopefulness. You will hardly demand
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) confidence should have a basis in external facts; such
confidence, we know, is something less coarse and materialistic: it is
a comfortable disposition leading us to expect that the wisdom of
providence or the folly of our friends, the mysteries of luck or the
still greater mystery of our high individual value in the universe,
will bring about agreeable issues, such as are consistent with our good
taste in costume, and our general preference for the best style of
thing. Fred felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should have a present from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should have a run of luck, that by dint of <div class="bookquote">``swapping''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should
gradually metamorphose a horse worth forty pounds into a horse that
would fetch a hundred at any moment--<div class="bookquote">``judgment''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>being always equivalent
to an unspecified sum in hard cash. And in any case, even supposing
negations which only a morbid distrust could imagine, Fred had always
-LRB-at that time-RRB- his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's pocket as a last resource, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
assets of hopefulness had a sort of gorgeous superfluity about them.
Of what might be the capacity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's pocket, Fred had only a
vague notion: was not trade elastic? And would not the deficiencies of
one year be made up for by the surplus of another? The Vincys lived in
an easy profuse way, not with any new ostentation, but according to the
family habits and traditions, so that the children had no standard of
economy, and the elder ones retained some of their infantine notion
that their father might pay for anything if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would. Mr. Vincy
himself had expensive Middlemarch habits--spent money on coursing, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) cellar, and on dinner-giving, while mamma had those running
accounts with tradespeople, which give a cheerful sense of getting
everything one wants without any question of payment. But it was in
the nature of fathers, Fred knew, to bully one about expenses: there
was always a little storm over his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) extravagance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had to disclose a
debt, and Fred disliked bad weather within doors. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was too filial to
be disrespectful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) bore the thunder with the
certainty that it was transient; but in the mean time it was
disagreeable to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother cry, and also to be obliged to look
sulky instead of having fun; for Fred was so good-tempered that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
looked glum under scolding, it was chiefly for propriety's sake. The
easier course plainly, was to renew the bill with a friend's signature.
Why not? With the superfluous securities of hope at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) command, there
was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should not have increased other people's
liabilities to any extent, but for the fact that men whose names were
good for anything were usually pessimists, indisposed to believe that
the universal order of things would necessarily be agreeable to an
agreeable young gentleman.

<p/>With a favor to ask we review our list of friends, do justice to their
more amiable qualities, forgive their little offenses, and concerning
each in turn, try to arrive at the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will be eager to
oblige us, our own eagerness to be obliged being as communicable as
other warmth. Still there is always a certain number who are dismissed
as but moderately eager until the others have refused; and it happened
that Fred checked off all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) friends but one, on the ground that
applying to them would be disagreeable; being implicitly convinced that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) at least -LRB-whatever might be maintained about mankind generally-RRB- had
a right to be free from anything disagreeable. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should ever
fall into a thoroughly unpleasant position--wear trousers shrunk with
washing, eat cold mutton, have to walk for want of a horse, or to <div class="bookquote">``duck
under''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in any sort of way--was an absurdity irreconcilable with those
cheerful intuitions implanted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) by nature. And Fred winced under
the idea of being looked down upon as wanting funds for small debts.
Thus it came to pass that the friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chose to apply to was at
once the poorest and the kindest--namely, Caleb Garth.

<p/>The Garths were very fond of Fred, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was of them; for when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and
Rosamond were little ones, and the Garths were better off, the slight
connection between the two families through Mr. Featherstone's double
marriage -LRB-the first to Mr. Garth's sister, and the second to Mrs.
Vincy's-RRB- had led to an acquaintance which was carried on between the
children rather than the parents: the children drank tea together out
of their toy teacups, and spent whole days together in play. Mary was
a little hoyden, and Fred at six years old thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) the nicest girl
in the world, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wife with a brass ring which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had cut
from an umbrella. Through all the stages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) education he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had kept
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) affection for the Garths, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) habit of going to their house as
a second home, though any intercourse between them and the elders of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) family had long ceased. Even when Caleb Garth was prosperous, the
Vincys were on condescending terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) wife, for there
were nice distinctions of rank in Middlemarch; and though old
manufacturers could not any more than dukes be connected with none but
equals, they were conscious of an inherent social superiority which was
defined with great nicety in practice, though hardly expressible
theoretically. Since then Mr. Garth had failed in the building
business, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had unfortunately added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) other avocations of
surveyor, valuer, and agent, had conducted that business for a time
entirely for the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) assignees, and had been living
narrowly, exerting himself to the utmost that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) might after all pay
twenty shillings in the pound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had now achieved this, and from all
who did not think it a bad precedent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) honorable exertions had won
him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) due esteem; but in no part of the world is genteel visiting founded
on esteem, in the absence of suitable furniture and complete
dinner-service. Mrs. Vincy had never been at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) ease with Mrs. Garth,
and frequently spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) as a woman who had had to work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
bread--meaning that Mrs. Garth had been a teacher before her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) marriage;
in which case an intimacy with Lindley Murray and Mangnall's Questions
was something like a draper's discrimination of calico trademarks, or a
courier's acquaintance with foreign countries: no woman who was better
off needed that sort of thing. And since Mary had been keeping Mr.
Featherstone's house, Mrs. Vincy's want of liking for the Garths had
been converted into something more positive, by alarm lest Fred should
engage himself to this plain girl, whose parents <div class="bookquote">``lived in such a small
way.''  (<font color='red'><b>parents</b></font>)</div>Fred, being aware of this, never spoke at home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) visits to
Mrs. Garth, which had of late become more frequent, the increasing
ardor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) affection for Mary inclining him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the more towards those
who belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>Mr. Garth had a small office in the town, and to this Fred went with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) request. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) obtained it without much difficulty, for a large
amount of painful experience had not sufficed to make Caleb Garth
cautious about his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own affairs, or distrustful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) fellow-men when
they had not proved themselves untrustworthy; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had the highest
opinion of Fred, was <div class="bookquote">``sure the lad would turn out well--an open
affectionate fellow, with a good bottom to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) character--you might
trust him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Such was Caleb's psychological argument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
was one of those rare men who are rigid to themselves and indulgent to
others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a certain shame about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) neighbors' errors, and never
spoke of them willingly; hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was not likely to divert his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind
from the best mode of hardening timber and other ingenious devices in
order to preconceive those errors. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had to blame any one, it was
necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to move all the papers within his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) reach, or describe
various diagrams with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stick, or make calculations with the odd
money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pocket, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could begin; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would rather do
other men's work than find fault with their doing. I fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was a bad
disciplinarian.

<p/>When Fred stated the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) debt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wish to meet it
without troubling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, and the certainty that the money would be
forthcoming so as to cause no one any inconvenience, Caleb pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
spectacles upward, listened, looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) favorite's clear young
eyes, and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), not distinguishing confidence about the future
from veracity about the past; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) felt that it was an occasion for a
friendly hint as to conduct, and that before giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) signature he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
must give a rather strong admonition. Accordingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) took the paper
and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spectacles, measured the space at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) command, reached
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) pen and examined it, dipped it in the ink and examined it again,
then pushed the paper a little way from him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spectacles
again, showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) bushy
eyebrows, which gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) face a peculiar mildness -LRB-pardon these details
for once--you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb
Garth-RRB-, and said in a comfortable tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a misfortune, eh, that breaking the horse's knees? And then,
these exchanges, they don't answer when you have `cute jockeys to deal
with. You'll be wiser another time, my boy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon Caleb drew down his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spectacles, and proceeded to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
signature with the care which he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) always gave to that performance; for
whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) did in the way of business he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) did well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) contemplated
the large well-proportioned letters and final flourish, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head a
trifle on one side for an instant, then handed it to Fred, said
<div class="bookquote">``Good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>and returned forthwith to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) absorption in a plan for Sir
James Chettam's new farm-buildings.

<p/>Either because his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) interest in this work thrust the incident of the
signature from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) memory, or for some reason of which Caleb was more
conscious, Mrs. Garth remained ignorant of the affair.

<p/>Since it occurred, a change had come over Fred's sky, which altered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
view of the distance, and was the reason why his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle Featherstone's
present of money was of importance enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) color come and
go, first with a too definite expectation, and afterwards with a
proportionate disappointment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) failure in passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) examination,
had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) accumulation of college debts the more unpardonable by his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
father, and there had been an unprecedented storm at home. Mr. Vincy
had sworn that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had anything more of that sort to put up with,
Fred should turn out and get his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) living how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had never
yet quite recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) good-humored tone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) son, who had
especially enraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) by saying at this stage of things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did
not want to be a clergyman, and would rather not <div class="bookquote">``go on with that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a clergyman</b></font>)</div>Fred was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would have been yet more severely dealt with
if his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) family as well as himself had not secretly regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) as Mr.
Featherstone's heir; that old gentleman's pride in him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), and apparent
fondness for him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), serving in the stead of more exemplary conduct--just
as when a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act
kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of
his (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) being sent to the house of correction as if he (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) were a ragged boy
who had stolen turnips. In fact, tacit expectations of what would be
done for him (<font color='blue'><b>nobleman</b></font>) by uncle Featherstone determined the angle at which most
people viewed Fred Vincy in Middlemarch; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) own consciousness,
what uncle Featherstone would do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) in an emergency, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
would do simply as an incorporated luck, formed always an immeasurable
depth of aerial perspective. But that present of bank-notes, once
made, was measurable, and being applied to the amount of the debt,
showed a deficit which had still to be filled up either by Fred's
<div class="bookquote">``judgment''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>or by luck in some other shape. For that little episode of
the alleged borrowing, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father the agent in
getting the Bulstrode certificate, was a new reason against going to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father for money towards meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) actual debt. Fred was keen
enough to foresee that anger would confuse distinctions, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
denial of having borrowed expressly on the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle's will
would be taken as a falsehood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
one vexatious affair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had left another untold: in such cases the
complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous
duplicity. Now Fred piqued himself on keeping clear of lies, and even
fibs; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) often shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) shoulders and made a significant grimace at
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) called Rosamond's fibs -LRB-it is only brothers who can associate
such ideas with a lovely girl-RRB-; and rather than incur the accusation of
falsehood he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would even incur some trouble and self-restraint. It was
under strong inward pressure of this kind that Fred had taken the wise
step of depositing the eighty pounds with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother. It was a pity
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not at once given them to Mr. Garth; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) meant to make
the sum complete with another sixty, and with a view to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had
kept twenty pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own pocket as a sort of seed-corn, which,
planted by judgment, and watered by luck, might yield more than
threefold--a very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young
gentleman's infinite soul, with all the numerals at command.

<p/>Fred was not a gambler: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not that specific disease in which the
suspension of the whole nervous energy on a chance or risk becomes as
necessary as the dram to the drunkard; he (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) had only the tendency to that
diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity, but is
carried on with the healthiest chyle-fed blood, keeping up a joyous
imaginative activity which fashions events according to desire, and
having no fears about its own weather, only sees the advantage there
must be to others in going aboard with it. Hopefulness has a pleasure
in making a throw of any kind, because the prospect of success is
certain; and only a more generous pleasure in offering as many as
possible a share in the stake. Fred liked play, especially billiards,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) liked hunting or riding a steeple-chase; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) only liked it the
better because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wanted money and hoped to win. But the twenty
pounds' worth of seed-corn had been planted in vain in the seductive
green plot--all of it at least which had not been dispersed by the
roadside--and Fred found himself close upon the term of payment with no
money at command beyond the eighty pounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had deposited with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother. The broken-winded horse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) rode represented a
present which had been made to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a long while ago by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle
Featherstone: his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father always allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to keep a horse, Mr.
Vincy's own habits making him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) regard this as a reasonable demand even
for a son who was rather exasperating. This horse, then, was Fred's
property, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) anxiety to meet the imminent bill he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) determined to
sacrifice a possession without which life would certainly be worth
little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) made the resolution with a sense of heroism--heroism forced
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) by the dread of breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) word to Mr. Garth, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) love for
Mary and awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would start for Houndsley horse-fair
which was to be held the next morning, and--simply sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse,
bringing back the money by coach?--Well, the horse would hardly fetch
more than thirty pounds, and there was no knowing what might happen; it
would be folly to balk himself of luck beforehand. It was a hundred to
one that some good chance would fall in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) way; the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) thought
of it, the less possible it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should not have a good
chance, and the less reasonable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should not equip himself with
the powder and shot for bringing it down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would ride to Houndsley
with Bambridge and with Horrock <div class="bookquote">``the vet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Horrock/Mr. Horrock</b></font>)</div>and without asking them
anything expressly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) should virtually get the benefit of their
opinion. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) set out, Fred got the eighty pounds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother.

<p/>Most of those who saw Fred riding out of Middlemarch in company with
Bambridge and Horrock, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) way of course to Houndsley horse-fair,
thought that young Vincy was pleasure-seeking as usual; and but for an
unwonted consciousness of grave matters on hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) himself would have
had a sense of dissipation, and of doing what might be expected of a
gay young fellow. Considering that Fred was not at all coarse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
rather looked down on the manners and speech of young men who had not
been to the university, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had written stanzas as pastoral and
unvoluptuous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) flute-playing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) attraction towards Bambridge and
Horrock was an interesting fact which even the love of horse-flesh
would not wholly account for without that mysterious influence of
Naming which determinates so much of mortal choice. Under any other
name than <div class="bookquote">``pleasure''  (<font color='red'><b>Horrock/Mr. Horrock</b></font>)</div>the society of Messieurs Bambridge and Horrock
must certainly have been regarded as monotonous; and to arrive with
them at Houndsley on a drizzling afternoon, to get down at the Red Lion
in a street shaded with coal-dust, and dine in a room furnished with a
dirt-enamelled map of the county, a bad portrait of an anonymous horse
in a stable, His (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) Majesty George the Fourth with legs and cravat, and
various leaden spittoons, might have seemed a hard business, but for
the sustaining power of nomenclature which determined that the pursuit
of these things was <div class="bookquote">``gay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Eliot</b></font>)</div><p/>In Mr. Horrock there was certainly an apparent unfathomableness which
offered play to the imagination. Costume, at a glance, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) a
thrilling association with horses -LRB-enough to specify the hat-brim which
took the slightest upward angle just to escape the suspicion of bending
downwards-RRB-, and nature had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) a face which by dint of Mongolian
eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) hat-brim in a
moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable
sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a
susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to
create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund
of humor--too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable
crust,--and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate
enough to know it, would be _the_ thing and no other. It is a
physiognomy seen in all vocations, but perhaps it has never been more
powerful over the youth of England than in a judge of horses.

<p/>Mr. Horrock, at a question from Fred about his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) horse's fetlock, turned
sideways in his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) saddle, and watched the horse's action for the space of
three minutes, then turned forward, twitched his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) own bridle, and
remained silent with a profile neither more nor less sceptical than it
had been.

<p/>The part thus played in dialogue by Mr. Horrock was terribly effective.
A mixture of passions was excited in Fred--a mad desire to thrash
Horrock's opinion into utterance, restrained by anxiety to retain the
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) friendship. There was always the chance that Horrock
might say something quite invaluable at the right moment.

<p/>Mr. Bambridge had more open manners, and appeared to give forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>)
ideas without economy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) was loud, robust, and was sometimes spoken
of as being <div class="bookquote">``given to indulgence'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--chiefly in swearing, drinking, and
beating his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) wife. Some people who had lost by him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) a vicious
man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) regarded horse-dealing as the finest of the arts, and might
have argued plausibly that it had nothing to do with morality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) was
undeniably a prosperous man, bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) drinking better than others bore
their moderation, and, on the whole, flourished like the green
bay-tree. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) range of conversation was limited, and like the fine
old tune, <div class="bookquote">``Drops of brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>gave you after a while a sense of
returning upon itself in a way that might make weak heads dizzy. But a
slight infusion of Mr. Bambridge was felt to give tone and character to
several circles in Middlemarch; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) was a distinguished figure in
the bar and billiard-room at the Green Dragon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) knew some anecdotes
about the heroes of the turf, and various clever tricks of Marquesses
and Viscounts which seemed to prove that blood asserted its
pre-eminence even among black-legs; but the minute retentiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>)
memory was chiefly shown about the horses he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had himself bought and
sold; the number of miles they would trot you in no time without
turning a hair being, after the lapse of years, still a subject of
passionate asseveration, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) would assist the imagination of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) hearers by solemnly swearing that they never saw anything like it.
In short, Mr. Bambridge was a man of pleasure and a gay companion.

<p/>Fred was subtle, and did not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) friends that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was going to
Houndsley bent on selling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wished to get indirectly at
their genuine opinion of its value, not being aware that a genuine
opinion was the last thing likely to be extracted from such eminent
critics. It was not Mr. Bambridge's weakness to be a gratuitous
flatterer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had never before been so much struck with the fact that
this unfortunate bay was a roarer to a degree which required the
roundest word for perdition to give you any idea of it.

<p/>``You made a bad hand at swapping when you went to anybody but me,
Vincy! Why, you never threw your leg across a finer horse than that
chestnut, and you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) for this brute. If you set him (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) cantering,
he (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) goes on like twenty sawyers. I never heard but one worse roarer in
my life, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor;
he (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) used to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) gig seven years ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) wanted me to
take him (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>), but I said, ``Thank you, Peg, I don't deal in
wind-instruments.<div class="bookquote">'' That was what I said. It went the round of the
country, that joke did. But, what the hell! the horse was a penny
trumpet to that roarer of yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you said just now his (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) was worse than mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, more
irritable than usual.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I said a lie, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bambridge, emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``There wasn't
a penny to choose between 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred spurred his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse, and they trotted on a little way. When they
slackened again, Mr. Bambridge said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not but what the roan was a better trotter than yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm quite satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) paces, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who required
all the consciousness of being in gay company to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I say
his (<font color='blue'><b>vet</b></font>) trot is an uncommonly clean one, eh, Horrock?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Horrock looked before him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) with as complete a neutrality as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>)
had been a portrait by a great master.

<p/>Fred gave up the fallacious hope of getting a genuine opinion; but on
reflection he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) saw that Bambridge's depreciation and Horrock's silence
were both virtually encouraging, and indicated that they thought better
of the horse than they chose to say.

<p/>That very evening, indeed, before the fair had set in, Fred thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
saw a favorable opening for disposing advantageously of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse, but
an opening which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) congratulate himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) foresight in
bringing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eighty pounds. A young farmer, acquainted with
Mr. Bambridge, came into the Red Lion, and entered into conversation
about parting with a hunter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) introduced at once as Diamond,
implying that it was a public character. For himself he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) only wanted a
useful hack, which would draw upon occasion; being about to marry and
to give up hunting. The hunter was in a friend's stable at some little
distance; there was still time for gentlemen to see it before dark.
The friend's stable had to be reached through a back street where you
might as easily have been poisoned without expense of drugs as in any
grim street of that unsanitary period. Fred was not fortified against
disgust by brandy, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) companions were, but the hope of having at
last seen the horse that would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to make money was
exhilarating enough to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) over the same ground again the first
thing in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) felt sure that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did not come to a
bargain with the farmer, Bambridge would; for the stress of
circumstances, Fred felt, was sharpening his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) acuteness and endowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
with all the constructive power of suspicion. Bambridge had run down
Diamond in a way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) never would have done -LRB-the horse being a
friend's-RRB- if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had not thought of buying it; every one who looked at
the animal--even Horrock--was evidently impressed with its merit. To
get all the advantage of being with men of this sort, you must know how
to draw your inferences, and not be a spoon who takes things literally.
The color of the horse was a dappled gray, and Fred happened to know
that Lord Medlicote's man was on the look-out for just such a horse.
After all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) running down, Bambridge let it out in the course of the
evening, when the farmer was absent, that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had seen worse horses go
for eighty pounds. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) contradicted himself twenty times
over, but when you know what is likely to be true you can test a man's
admissions. And Fred could not but reckon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own judgment of a horse
as worth something. The farmer had paused over Fred's respectable
though broken-winded steed long enough to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) thought it worth
consideration, and it seemed probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would take it, with
five-and-twenty pounds in addition, as the equivalent of Diamond. In
that case Fred, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had parted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) new horse for at least
eighty pounds, would be fifty-five pounds in pocket by the transaction,
and would have a hundred and thirty-five pounds towards meeting the
bill; so that the deficit temporarily thrown on Mr. Garth would at the
utmost be twenty-five pounds. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was hurrying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
clothes in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) saw so clearly the importance of not losing
this rare chance, that if Bambridge and Horrock had both dissuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) would not have been deluded into a direct interpretation of their
purpose: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) would have been aware that those deep hands held something
else than a young fellow's interest. With regard to horses, distrust
was your only clew. But scepticism, as we know, can never be
thoroughly applied, else life would come to a standstill: something we
must believe in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it
is virtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish
reliance on another. Fred believed in the excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) bargain,
and even before the fair had well set in, had got possession of the
dappled gray, at the price of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) old horse and thirty pounds in
addition--only five pounds more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had expected to give.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) felt a little worried and wearied, perhaps with mental debate,
and without waiting for the further gayeties of the horse-fair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) set
out alone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) fourteen miles' journey, meaning to take it very
quietly and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse fresh.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The offender's sorrow brings but small relief
To him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) who wears the strong offence's cross.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: Sonnets.


<p/>I am sorry to say that only the third day after the propitious events
at Houndsley Fred Vincy had fallen into worse spirits than he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had known
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) life before. Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had been disappointed as to the
possible market for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) horse, but that before the bargain could be
concluded with Lord Medlicote's man, this Diamond, in which hope to the
amount of eighty pounds had been invested, had without the slightest
warning exhibited in the stable a most vicious energy in kicking, had
just missed killing the groom, and had ended in laming himself severely
by catching his (<font color='blue'><b>groom</b></font>) leg in a rope that overhung the stable-board. There was
no more redress for this than for the discovery of bad temper after
marriage--which of course old companions were aware of before the
ceremony. For some reason or other, Fred had none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) usual
elasticity under this stroke of ill-fortune: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was simply aware that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had only fifty pounds, that there was no chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) getting any
more at present, and that the bill for a hundred and sixty would be
presented in five days. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father on the
plea that Mr. Garth should be saved from loss, Fred felt smartingly
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father would angrily refuse to rescue Mr. Garth from the
consequence of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would call encouraging extravagance and deceit.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was so utterly downcast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could frame no other project than to
go straight to Mr. Garth and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) the sad truth, carrying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
the fifty pounds, and getting that sum at least safely out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own
hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) father, being at the warehouse, did not yet know of the
accident: when he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would storm about the vicious brute being
brought into his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) stable; and before meeting that lesser annoyance Fred
wanted to get away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) courage to face the greater. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) took
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's nag, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had told Mr.
Garth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would ride to Stone Court and confess all to Mary. In fact,
it is probable that but for Mary's existence and Fred's love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) conscience would have been much less active both in previously
urging the debt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) thought and impelling him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) not to spare himself
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) usual fashion by deferring an unpleasant task, but to act as
directly and simply as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could. Even much stronger mortals than Fred
Vincy hold half their rectitude in the mind of the being they love
best. <div class="bookquote">``The theatre of all my actions is fallen,''  (<font color='red'><b>an personage</b></font>)</div>said an antique
personage when his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) chief friend was dead; and they are fortunate who
get a theatre where the audience demands their best. Certainly it
would have made a considerable difference to Fred at that time if Mary
Garth had had no decided notions as to what was admirable in character.

<p/>Mr. Garth was not at the office, and Fred rode on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) house, which
was a little way outside the town--a homely place with an orchard in
front of it, a rambling, old-fashioned, half-timbered building, which
before the town had spread had been a farm-house, but was now
surrounded with the private gardens of the townsmen. We get the fonder
of our houses if they have a physiognomy of their own, as our friends
have. The Garth family, which was rather a large one, for Mary had
four brothers and one sister, were very fond of their old house, from
which all the best furniture had long been sold. Fred liked it too,
knowing it by heart even to the attic which smelt deliciously of apples
and quinces, and until to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had never come to it without pleasant
expectations; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) heart beat uneasily now with the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
should probably have to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) confession before Mrs. Garth, of whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was rather more in awe than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was
inclined to sarcasm and to impulsive sallies, as Mary was. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
present matronly age at least, Mrs. Garth never committed herself by
over-hasty speech; having, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) said, borne the yoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) youth,
and learned self-control. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had that rare sense which discerns what
is unalterable, and submits to it without murmuring. Adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
husband's virtues, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had very early made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) mind to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
incapacity of minding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own interests, and had met the consequences
cheerfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had been magnanimous enough to renounce all pride in
teapots or children's frilling, and had never poured any pathetic
confidences into the ears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) feminine neighbors concerning Mr.
Garth's want of prudence and the sums he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) might have had if he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had been
like other men. Hence these fair neighbors thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) either proud or
eccentric, and sometimes spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) to their husbands as <div class="bookquote">``your fine
Mrs. Garth.''  (<font color='red'><b>husbands</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was not without her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) criticism of them in return, being
more accurately instructed than most matrons in Middlemarch, and--where
is the blameless woman?--apt to be a little severe towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex,
which in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opinion was framed to be entirely subordinate. On the
other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was disproportionately indulgent towards the failings
of men, and was often heard to say that these were natural. Also, it
must be admitted that Mrs. Garth was a trifle too emphatic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
resistance to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) held to be follies: the passage from governess
into housewife had wrought itself a little too strongly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
consciousness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) rarely forgot that while her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) grammar and accent
were above the town standard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) wore a plain cap, cooked the family
dinner, and darned all the stockings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had sometimes taken pupils
in a peripatetic fashion, making them follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) about in the kitchen
with their book or slate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) thought it good for them to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
could make an excellent lather while she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) corrected their blunders
<div class="bookquote">``without looking,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--that a woman with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeves tucked up above her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
elbows might know all about the Subjunctive Mood or the Torrid
Zone--that, in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might possess <div class="bookquote">``education''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and other good
things ending in <div class="bookquote">``tion,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and worthy to be pronounced emphatically,
without being a useless doll. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made remarks to this edifying
effect, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a firm little frown on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brow, which yet did not
hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face from looking benevolent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words which came forth
like a procession were uttered in a fervid agreeable contralto.
Certainly, the exemplary Mrs. Garth had her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) droll aspects, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
character sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) oddities, as a very fine wine sustains a flavor
of skin.

<p/>Towards Fred Vincy she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had a motherly feeling, and had always been
disposed to excuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) errors, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would probably not have
excused Mary for engaging herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) daughter being included
in that more rigorous judgment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own sex. But
this very fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) exceptional indulgence towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) made it the
harder to Fred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must now inevitably sink in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) opinion. And
the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) visit turned out to be still more unpleasant
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had expected; for Caleb Garth had gone out early to look at
some repairs not far off. Mrs. Garth at certain hours was always in
the kitchen, and this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was carrying on several occupations
at once there--making her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) pies at the well-scoured deal table on one
side of that airy room, observing Sally's movements at the oven and
dough-tub through an open door, and giving lessons to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) youngest boy
and girl, who were standing opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) at the table with their
books and slates before them. A tub and a clothes-horse at the other
end of the kitchen indicated an intermittent wash of small things also
going on.

<p/>Mrs. Garth, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) sleeves turned above her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) elbows, deftly handling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) pastry--applying her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) rolling-pin and giving ornamental pinches,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) expounded with grammatical fervor what were the right views
about the concord of verbs and pronouns with <div class="bookquote">``nouns of multitude or
signifying many,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was a sight agreeably amusing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was of the same
curly-haired, square-faced type as Mary, but handsomer, with more
delicacy of feature, a pale skin, a solid matronly figure, and a
remarkable firmness of glance. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) snowy-frilled cap she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reminded
one of that delightful Frenchwoman whom we have all seen marketing,
basket on arm. Looking at the mother, you might hope that the daughter
would become like her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), which is a prospective advantage equal to a
dowry--the mother too often standing behind the daughter like a
malignant prophecy--<div class="bookquote">``Such as I am, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) will shortly be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now let us go through that once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, pinching an
apple-puff which seemed to distract Ben, an energetic young male with a
heavy brow, from due attention to the lesson. <div class="bookquote">''`Not without regard to
the import of the word as conveying unity or plurality of idea'--tell
me again what that means, Ben.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Mrs. Garth, like more celebrated educators, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) favorite ancient
paths, and in a general wreck of society would have tried to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``Lindley Murray''  (<font color='red'><b>educators</b></font>)</div>above the waves.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh--it means--you must think what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, rather
peevishly. <div class="bookquote">``I hate grammar. What's the use of it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To teach you to speak and write correctly, so that you can be
understood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, with severe precision. <div class="bookquote">``Should you like
to speak as old Job does?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, stoutly; ``it's funnier. He (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) says, ``Yo goo'--that's
just as good as <div class="bookquote">``You go.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) says, ``A ship's in the garden,<div class="bookquote">'' instead of 'a sheep,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said
Letty, with an air of superiority. <div class="bookquote">``You might think he (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) meant a ship
off the sea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you mightn't, if you weren't silly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben. <div class="bookquote">``How could a ship
off the sea come there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These things belong only to pronunciation, which is the least part of
grammar,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth. <div class="bookquote">``That apple-peel is to be eaten by the
pigs, Ben; if you eat it, I must give them your piece of pasty. Job
has only to speak about very plain things. How do you think you would
write or speak about anything more difficult, if you knew no more of
grammar than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the
wrong places, and instead of making people understand you, they would
turn away from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't care, I should leave off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, with a sense that
this was an agreeable issue where grammar was concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you are getting tired and stupid, Ben,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth,
accustomed to these obstructive arguments from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) male offspring.
Having finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) pies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) moved towards the clothes-horse, and
said, <div class="bookquote">``Come here and tell me the story I told you on Wednesday, about
Cincinnatus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know! he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was a farmer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Ben, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was a Roman--let _me_ tell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said Letty, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) elbow
contentiously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You silly thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was a Roman farmer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) was ploughing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but before that--that didn't come first--people wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said
Letty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but you must say what sort of a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>insisted Ben.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a wise man, like my father, and that made the people want his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Ben, let me tell the story straight on, as mother told it us,''

from the tub. <div class="bookquote">``When your brother began, you ought to have waited to
see if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and

Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation,
and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem,
that of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Now,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well--oh--well--why, there was a great deal of fighting, and they were

 (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dictator, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said Letty, with injured looks, and not without a wish
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) mother repent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, dictator!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``But that isn't a
good word: he (<font color='blue'><b>dictator</b></font>) didn't tell them to write on slates.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Ben, you are not so ignorant as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth,
carefully serious. <div class="bookquote">``Hark, there is a knock at the door! Run, Letty,
and open it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>The knock was Fred's; and when Letty said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) father was not in
yet, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) mother was in the kitchen, Fred had no alternative.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could not depart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) usual practice of going to see Mrs. Garth
in the kitchen if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) happened to be at work there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) arm
round Letty's neck silently, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) into the kitchen without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
usual jokes and caresses.

<p/>Mrs. Garth was surprised to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not
a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was given to express, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) only said, quietly
continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) work--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, Fred, so early in the day? You look quite pale. Has anything
happened?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to Mr. Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, not yet ready to say
more--<div class="bookquote">``and to you also,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) added, after a little pause, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had no
doubt that Mrs. Garth knew everything about the bill, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must in the
end speak of it before her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), if not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) solely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Caleb will be in again in a few minutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, who
imagined some trouble between Fred and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) is sure not to
be long, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) has some work at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) desk that must be done this
morning. Do you mind staying with me, while I finish my matters here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we needn't go on about Cincinnatus, need we?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, who had
taken Fred's whip out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hand, and was trying its efficiency on the
cat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, go out now. But put that whip down. How very mean of you to whip
poor old Tortoise! Pray take the whip from him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, old boy, give it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me ride on your horse to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, rendering up the
whip, with an air of not being obliged to do it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not to-day--another time. I am not riding my own horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you see Mary to-day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with an unpleasant twinge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to come home soon, and play at forfeits, and make fun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough, enough, Ben! run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, seeing that Fred was
teased...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are Letty and Ben your only pupils now, Mrs. Garth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, when
the children were gone and it was needful to say something that would
pass the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was not yet sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should wait for Mr.
Garth, or use any good opportunity in conversation to confess to Mrs.
Garth herself, give her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) the money and ride away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One--only one. Fanny Hackbutt comes at half past eleven. I am not
getting a great income now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I am at a low
ebb with pupils. But I have saved my little purse for Alfred's
premium: I have ninety-two pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) can go to Mr. Hanmer's now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
is just at the right age.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>This did not lead well towards the news that Mr. Garth was on the brink
of losing ninety-two pounds and more. Fred was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Young
gentlemen who go to college are rather more costly than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>Mrs.
Garth innocently continued, pulling out the edging on a cap-border.
<div class="bookquote">``And Caleb thinks that Alfred will turn out a distinguished engineer:
he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) wants to give the boy a good chance. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is! I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)
coming in. We will go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) in the parlor, shall we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>When they entered the parlor Caleb had thrown down his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hat and was
seated at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) desk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Fred, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said, in a tone of mild surprise, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
pen still undipped; <div class="bookquote">``you are here betimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But missing the usual
expression of cheerful greeting in Fred's face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) immediately added,
<div class="bookquote">``Is there anything up at home?--anything the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Garth, I am come to tell something that I am afraid will give
you a bad opinion of me. I am come to tell you and Mrs. Garth that I
can't keep my word. I can't find the money to meet the bill after all.
I have been unfortunate; I have only got these fifty pounds towards the
hundred and sixty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>While Fred was speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had taken out the notes and laid them on
the desk before Mr. Garth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had burst forth at once with the plain
fact, feeling boyishly miserable and without verbal resources. Mrs.
Garth was mutely astonished, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband for an
explanation. Caleb blushed, and after a little pause said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I didn't tell you, Susan: I put my name to a bill for Fred; it was
for a hundred and sixty pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) made sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could meet it himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>There was an evident change in Mrs. Garth's face, but it was like a
change below the surface of water which remains smooth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
eyes on Fred, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have asked your father for the rest of the money and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
has refused you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) lip, and speaking with more difficulty;
<div class="bookquote">``but I know it will be of no use to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and unless it were of use,
I should not like to mention Mr. Garth's name in the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has come at an unfortunate time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hesitating
way, looking down at the notes and nervously fingering the paper,
<div class="bookquote">``Christmas upon us--I'm rather hard up just now. You see, I have to
cut out everything like a tailor with short measure. What can we do,
Susan? I shall want every farthing we have in the bank. It's a
hundred and ten pounds, the deuce take it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must give you the ninety-two pounds that I have put by for Alfred's
premium,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, gravely and decisively, though a nice ear
might have discerned a slight tremor in some of the words. <div class="bookquote">``And I have
no doubt that Mary has twenty pounds saved from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) salary by this
time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will advance it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garth had not again looked at Fred, and was not in the least
calculating what words she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) should use to cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the most effectively.
Like the eccentric woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at present absorbed in
considering what was to be done, and did not fancy that the end could
be better achieved by bitter remarks or explosions. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made
Fred feel for the first time something like the tooth of remorse.
Curiously enough, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pain in the affair beforehand had consisted
almost entirely in the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must seem dishonorable, and sink
in the opinion of the Garths: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not occupied himself with the
inconvenience and possible injury that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) breach might occasion them,
for this exercise of the imagination on other people's needs is not
common with hopeful young gentlemen. Indeed we are most of us brought
up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is
something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong. But
at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) suddenly saw himself as a pitiful rascal who was
robbing two women of their savings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall certainly pay it all, Mrs. Garth--ultimately,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stammered
out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ultimately,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, who having a special dislike to
fine words on ugly occasions, could not now repress an epigram. <div class="bookquote">``But
boys cannot well be apprenticed ultimately: they should be apprenticed
at fifteen.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had never been so little inclined to make excuses for
Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was the most in the wrong, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb. <div class="bookquote">``Fred made sure of
finding the money. But I'd no business to be fingering bills. I
suppose you have looked all round and tried all honest means?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
added, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) merciful gray eyes on Fred. Caleb was too delicate,
to specify Mr. Featherstone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have tried everything--I really have. I should have had a
hundred and thirty pounds ready but for a misfortune with a horse which
I was about to sell. My uncle had given me eighty pounds, and I paid
away thirty with my old horse in order to get another which I was going
to sell for eighty or more--I meant to go without a horse--but now it
has turned out vicious and lamed itself. I wish I and the horses too
had been at the devil, before I had brought this on you. There's no
one else I care so much for: you and Mrs. Garth have always been so
kind to me. However, it's no use saying that. You will always think
me a rascal now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred turned round and hurried out of the room, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was
getting rather womanish, and feeling confusedly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) being sorry
was not of much use to the Garths. They could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mount, and
quickly pass through the gate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am disappointed in Fred Vincy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth. <div class="bookquote">``I would not have
believed beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would have drawn you into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) debts. I
knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was extravagant, but I did not think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would be so mean
as to hang his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) risks on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) oldest friend, who could the least afford
to lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was a fool, Susan:''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you were,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife, nodding and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``But I should not
have gone to publish it in the market-place. Why should you keep such
things from me? It is just so with your buttons: you let them burst
off without telling me, and go out with your wristband hanging. If I
had only known I might have been ready with some better plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sadly cut up, I know, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, looking feelingly at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I can't abide your losing the money you've scraped together for
Alfred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very well that I _had_ scraped it together; and it is you who
will have to suffer, for you must teach the boy yourself. You must
give up your bad habits. Some men take to drinking, and you have taken
to working without pay. You must indulge yourself a little less in
that. And you must ride over to Mary, and ask the child what money she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
has.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb had pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) chair back, and was leaning forward, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
head slowly, and fitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) finger-tips together with much nicety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mary!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) went on in a lowered tone, <div class="bookquote">``I'm
afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) may be fond of Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no! She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) always laughs at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not likely to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
in any other than a brotherly way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb made no rejoinder, but presently lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spectacles, drew up
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) chair to the desk, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Deuce take the bill--I wish it was
at Hanover! These things are a sad interruption to business!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>The first part of this speech comprised his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) whole store of maledictory
expression, and was uttered with a slight snarl easy to imagine. But
it would be difficult to convey to those who never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) utter the
word <div class="bookquote">``business,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>the peculiar tone of fervid veneration, of religious
regard, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wrapped it, as a consecrated symbol is wrapped in
its gold-fringed linen.

<p/>Caleb Garth often shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) head in meditation on the value, the
indispensable might of that myriad-headed, myriad-handed labor by which
the social body is fed, clothed, and housed. It had laid hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
imagination in boyhood. The echoes of the great hammer where roof or
keel were a-making, the signal-shouts of the workmen, the roar of the
furnace, the thunder and plash of the engine, were a sublime music to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>); the felling and lading of timber, and the huge trunk vibrating
star-like in the distance along the highway, the crane at work on the
wharf, the piled-up produce in warehouses, the precision and variety of
muscular effort wherever exact work had to be turned out,--all these
sights of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) youth had acted on him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) as poetry without the aid of the
poets, had made a philosophy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) without the aid of philosophers,
a religion without the aid of theology. His (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) early ambition had been to
have as effective a share as possible in this sublime labor, which was
peculiarly dignified by him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) with the name of <div class="bookquote">``business;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
had only been a short time under a surveyor, and had been chiefly his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
own teacher, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) knew more of land, building, and mining than most of
the special men in the county.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) classification of human employments was rather crude, and, like the
categories of more celebrated men, would not be acceptable in these
advanced times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) divided them into <div class="bookquote">``business, politics, preaching,
learning, and amusement.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had nothing to say against the last four;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) regarded them as a reverential pagan regarded other gods than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own. In the same way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) thought very well of all ranks, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
would not himself have liked to be of any rank in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had not such
close contact with <div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as to get often honorably decorated with
marks of dust and mortar, the damp of the engine, or the sweet soil of
the woods and fields. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had never regarded himself as other
than an orthodox Christian, and would argue on prevenient grace if the
subject were proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) virtual divinities were good
practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of
undertakings: his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) prince of darkness was a slack workman. But there
was no spirit of denial in Caleb, and the world seemed so wondrous to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was ready to accept any number of systems, like any number
of firmaments, if they did not obviously interfere with the best
land-drainage, solid building, correct measuring, and judicious boring
-LRB-for coal-RRB-. In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had a reverential soul with a strong practical
intelligence. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could not manage finance: he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) knew values well,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had no keenness of imagination for monetary results in the shape
of profit and loss: and having ascertained this to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) cost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
determined to give up all forms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) beloved <div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which
required that talent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) gave himself up entirely to the many kinds of
work which he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could do without handling capital, and was one of those
precious men within his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) own district whom everybody would choose to
work for them, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) work well, charged very little, and
often declined to charge at all. It is no wonder, then, that the
Garths were poor, and <div class="bookquote">``lived in a small way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>However, they did not
mind it.



<p/>CHAPTER XXV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love seeketh not itself to please,
Nor for itself hath any care
But for another gives its ease
And builds a heaven in hell's despair.
... . .
Love seeketh only self to please,
To bind another to its delight,
Joys in another's loss of ease,
And builds a hell in heaven's despite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--W. BLAKE: Songs of Experience


<p/>Fred Vincy wanted to arrive at Stone Court when Mary could not expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>), and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) uncle was not down-stairs in that case she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be
sitting alone in the wainscoted parlor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) horse in the yard
to avoid making a noise on the gravel in front, and entered the parlor
without other notice than the noise of the door-handle. Mary was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
usual corner, laughing over Mrs. Piozzi's recollections of Johnson, and
looked up with the fun still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face. It gradually faded as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
saw Fred approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) without speaking, and stand before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
elbow on the mantel-piece, looking ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) too was silent, only
raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) inquiringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``I am a good-for-nothing blackguard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think one of those epithets would do at a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary,
trying to smile, but feeling alarmed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you will never think well of me any more. You will think me a
liar. You will think me dishonest. You will think I didn't care for
you, or your father and mother. You always do make the worst of me, I
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot deny that I shall think all that of you, Fred, if you give me
good reasons. But please to tell me at once what you have done. I
would rather know the painful truth than imagine it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I owed money--a hundred and sixty pounds. I asked your father to put

And now, I have been so unlucky--a horse has turned out badly--I can
only pay fifty pounds. And I can't ask my father for the money: he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
would not give me a farthing. And my uncle gave me a hundred a little
while ago. So what can I do? And now your father has no ready money
to spare, and your mother will have to pay away her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ninety-two pounds

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, poor mother, poor father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes filling with tears,
and a little sob rising which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried to repress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looked
straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and took no notice of Fred, all the consequences at
home becoming present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) too remained silent for some moments,
feeling more miserable than ever. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't have hurt you for the
world, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said at last. <div class="bookquote">``You can never forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What does it matter whether I forgive you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, passionately.
<div class="bookquote">``Would that make it any better for my mother to lose the money she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has
been earning by lessons for four years, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might send Alfred to

you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say what you like, Mary. I deserve it all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, more quietly, <div class="bookquote">``and my anger
is of no use.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes, threw aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) book, rose and
fetched her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sewing.

<p/>Fred followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes, hoping that they would meet hers, and
in that way find access for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) imploring penitence. But no! Mary
could easily avoid looking upward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do care about your mother's money going,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
seated again and sewing quickly. <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask you, Mary--don't
you think that Mr. Featherstone--if you were to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)--tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), I
mean, about apprenticing Alfred--would advance the money?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My family is not fond of begging, Fred. We would rather work for our
money. Besides, you say that Mr. Featherstone has lately given you a
hundred pounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) rarely makes presents; he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) has never made presents
to us. I am sure my father will not ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for anything; and even if
I chose to beg of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), it would be of no use.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so miserable, Mary--if you knew how miserable I am, you would be
sorry for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are other things to be more sorry for than that. But selfish
people always think their own discomfort of more importance than
anything else in the world. I see enough of that every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly fair to call me selfish. If you knew what things other
young men do, you would think me a good way off the worst.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that people who spend a great deal of money on themselves
without knowing how they shall pay, must be selfish. They are always
thinking of what they can get for themselves, and not of what other

he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant it. There is not a better man in the world than your father,
and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you make any comparison between my father and you, Fred?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, in a deep tone of indignation. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) never got into trouble
by thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own idle pleasures, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was always
thinking of the work he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was doing for other people. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has fared
hard, and worked hard to make good everybody's loss.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think that I shall never try to make good anything, Mary. It
is not generous to believe the worst of a man. When you have got any
power over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I think you might try and use it to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better;
but that is what you never do. However, I'm going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred ended,
languidly. <div class="bookquote">``I shall never speak to you about anything again. I'm very
sorry for all the trouble I've caused--that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) work out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand and looked up. There is
often something maternal even in a girlish love, and Mary's hard
experience had wrought her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nature to an impressibility very different
from that hard slight thing which we call girlishness. At Fred's last
words she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt an instantaneous pang, something like what a mother
feels at the imagined sobs or cries of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) naughty truant child, which
may lose itself and get harm. And when, looking up, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
dull despairing glance, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) surmounted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) anger and all
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) other anxieties.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Fred, how ill you look! Sit down a moment. Don't go yet. Let me
tell uncle that you are here. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has been wondering that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has not
seen you for a whole week.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary spoke hurriedly, saying the words
that came first without knowing very well what they were, but saying
them in a half-soothing half-beseeching tone, and rising as if to go
away to Mr. Featherstone. Of course Fred felt as if the clouds had
parted and a gleam had come: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) moved and stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say one word, Mary, and I will do anything. Say you will not think
the worst of me--will not give me up altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As if it were any pleasure to me to think ill of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, in a
mournful tone. <div class="bookquote">``As if it were not very painful to me to see you an
idle frivolous creature. How can you bear to be so contemptible, when
others are working and striving, and there are so many things to be
done--how can you bear to be fit for nothing in the world that is
useful? And with so much good in your disposition, Fred,--you might
be worth a great deal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to be anything you like, Mary, if you will say that you
love me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be ashamed to say that I loved a man who must always be
hanging on others, and reckoning on what they would do for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What
will you be when you are forty? Like Mr. Bowyer, I suppose--just as
idle, living in Mrs. Beck's front parlor--fat and shabby, hoping
somebody will invite you to dinner--spending your morning in learning a
comic song--oh no! learning a tune on the flute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's lips had begun to curl with a smile as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had asked
that question about Fred's future -LRB-young souls are mobile-RRB-, and before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face had its full illumination of fun. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) it was
like the cessation of an ache that Mary could laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and with a
passive sort of smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tried to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) slipped away
quickly towards the door and said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall tell uncle. You _must_ see
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) for a moment or two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred secretly felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) future was guaranteed against the
fulfilment of Mary's sarcastic prophecies, apart from that <div class="bookquote">``anything''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was ready to do if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would define it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) never dared in
Mary's presence to approach the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) expectations from Mr.
Featherstone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) always ignored them, as if everything depended on
himself. But if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) actually came into the property, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must
recognize the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) position. All this passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind
somewhat languidly, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) went up to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stayed but
a little while, excusing himself on the ground that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a cold; and
Mary did not reappear before he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) left the house. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) rode home,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) began to be more conscious of being ill, than of being melancholy.

<p/>When Caleb Garth arrived at Stone Court soon after dusk, Mary was not
surprised, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) seldom had leisure for paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a visit, and
was not at all fond of having to talk with Mr. Featherstone. The old
man, on the other hand, felt himself ill at ease with a brother-in-law
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) could not annoy, who did not mind about being considered poor,
had nothing to ask of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>), and understood all kinds of farming and
mining business better than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) did. But Mary had felt sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
parents would want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father had not come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would have obtained leave to go home for an hour or two the next day.
After discussing prices during tea with Mr. Featherstone Caleb rose to
bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) good-by, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I want to speak to you, Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took a candle into another large parlor, where there was no fire,
and setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table, turned
round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
with childish kisses which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) delighted in,--the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
large brows softening as the expression of a great beautiful dog
softens when it is caressed. Mary was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favorite child, and whatever
Susan might say, and right as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was on all other subjects, Caleb
thought it natural that Fred or any one else should think Mary more
lovable than other girls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got something to tell you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hesitating
way. <div class="bookquote">``No very good news; but then it might be worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About money, father? I think I know what it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay? how can that be? You see, I've been a bit of a fool again, and
put my name to a bill, and now it comes to paying; and your mother has
got to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) savings, that's the worst of it, and even they
won't quite make things even. We wanted a hundred and ten pounds: your
mother has ninety-two, and I have none to spare in the bank; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
thinks that you have some savings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes; I have more than four-and-twenty pounds. I thought you would
come, father, so I put it in my bag. See! beautiful white notes and
gold.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary took out the folded money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reticule and put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but how--we only want eighteen--here, put the rest back,
child,--but how did you know about it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
unconquerable indifference to money, was beginning to be chiefly
concerned about the relation the affair might have to Mary's affections.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred told me this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) come on purpose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was a good deal distressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid Fred is not to be trusted, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, with
hesitating tenderness. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) means better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) acts, perhaps. But I
should think it a pity for any body's happiness to be wrapped up in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and so would your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so should I, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, not looking up, but putting the
back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's hand against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to pry, my dear. But I was afraid there might be
something between you and Fred, and I wanted to caution you. You see,
Mary'' (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>--here Caleb's voice became more tender; he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had been pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
hat about on the table and looking at it, but finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) daughter--<div class="bookquote">``a woman, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) be as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) may, has got
to put up with the life her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband makes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Your mother has had
to put up with a good deal because of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary turned the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips and smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, nobody's perfect, but'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Garth shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) head to
help out the inadequacy of words--<div class="bookquote">``what I am thinking of is--what it
must be for a wife when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s never sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hasn't
got a principle in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more afraid of doing the wrong thing
by others than of getting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own toes pinched. That's the long and
the short of it, Mary. Young folks may get fond of each other before
they know what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can
only get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear.
However, you have more sense than most, and you haven't been kept in
cotton-wool: there may be no occasion for me to say this, but a father
trembles for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter, and you are all by yourself here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't fear for me, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, gravely meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's
eyes; <div class="bookquote">``Fred has always been very good to me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is kind-hearted and
affectionate, and not false, I think, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) self-indulgence. But
I will never engage myself to one who has no manly independence, and
who goes on loitering away his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) time on the chance that others will
provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). You and my mother have taught me too much pride for
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right--that's right. Then I am easy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Garth, taking
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) hat. <div class="bookquote">``But it's hard to run away with your earnings, eh child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) deepest tone of remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``Take
pocketfuls of love besides to them all at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) last word
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) closed the outer door on himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose your father wanted your earnings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said old Mr.
Featherstone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) usual power of unpleasant surmise, when Mary
returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) makes but a tight fit, I reckon. You're of age
now; you ought to be saving for yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I consider my father and mother the best part of myself, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said
Mary, coldly.

<p/>Mr. Featherstone grunted: he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) could not deny that an ordinary sort of
girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might be expected to be useful, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) thought of another
rejoinder, disagreeable enough to be always apropos. <div class="bookquote">``If Fred Vincy
comes to-morrow, now, don't you keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) chattering: let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) come up to

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) beats me and I rail at him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>): O worthy satisfaction!
would it were otherwise--that I could beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) railed at me.--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Troilus and Cressida.


<p/>But Fred did not go to Stone Court the next day, for reasons that were
quite peremptory. From those visits to unsanitary Houndsley streets in
search of Diamond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) had brought back not only a bad bargain in
horse-flesh, but the further misfortune of some ailment which for a day
or two had deemed mere depression and headache, but which got so much
worse when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) visit to Stone Court that, going into
the dining-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) threw himself on the sofa, and in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>)
mother's anxious question, said, <div class="bookquote">``I feel very ill: I think you must
send for Wrench.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Wrench came, but did not apprehend anything serious, spoke of a <div class="bookquote">``slight
derangement,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and did not speak of coming again on the morrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Diamond</b></font>) had
a due value for the Vincys' house, but the wariest men are apt to be
dulled by routine, and on worried mornings will sometimes go through
their business with the zest of the daily bell-ringer. Mr. Wrench was
a small, neat, bilious man, with a well-dressed wig: he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) had a laborious
practice, an irascible temper, a lymphatic wife and seven children; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) was already rather late before setting out on a four-miles drive to
meet Dr. Minchin on the other side of Tipton, the decease of Hicks, a
rural practitioner, having increased Middlemarch practice in that
direction. Great statesmen err, and why not small medical men? Mr.
Wrench did not neglect sending the usual white parcels, which this time
had black and drastic contents. Their effect was not alleviating to
poor Fred, who, however, unwilling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was
<div class="bookquote">``in for an illness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rose at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) usual easy hour the next morning and
went down-stairs meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in
sitting and shivering by the fire. Mr. Wrench was again sent for, but
was gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) rounds, and Mrs. Vincy seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) darling's changed
looks and general misery, began to cry and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would send for Dr.
Sprague.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, nonsense, mother! It's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hot
dry hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall soon be all right. I must have taken cold in
that nasty damp ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, who was seated near the window -LRB-the dining-room
windows looked on that highly respectable street called Lowick Gate-RRB-,
<div class="bookquote">``there is Mr. Lydgate, stopping to speak to some one. If I were you I
would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has cured Ellen Bulstrode. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cures
every one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vincy sprang to the window and opened it in an instant, thinking
only of Fred and not of medical etiquette. Lydgate was only two yards
off on the other side of some iron palisading, and turned round at the
sudden sound of the sash, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). In two minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was in the room, and Rosamond went out, after waiting just long enough
to show a pretty anxiety conflicting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sense of what was
becoming.

<p/>Lydgate had to hear a narrative in which Mrs. Vincy's mind insisted
with remarkable instinct on every point of minor importance, especially
on what Mr. Wrench had said and had not said about coming again. That
there might be an awkward affair with Wrench, Lydgate saw at once; but
the case was serious enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dismiss that consideration: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was convinced that Fred was in the pink-skinned stage of typhoid fever,
and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had taken just the wrong medicines. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must go to bed
immediately, must have a regular nurse, and various appliances and
precautions must be used, about which Lydgate was particular. Poor
Mrs. Vincy's terror at these indications of danger found vent in such
words as came most easily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thought it <div class="bookquote">``very ill usage on the part
of Mr. Wrench, who had attended their house so many years in preference
to Mr. Peacock, though Mr. Peacock was equally a friend. Why Mr.
Wrench should neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) children more than others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) could not for
the life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) understand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) had not neglected Mrs. Larcher's when
they had the measles, nor indeed would Mrs. Vincy have wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>)
should. And if anything should happen--''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Here poor Mrs. Vincy's spirit quite broke down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) Niobe throat
and good-humored face were sadly convulsed. This was in the hall out
of Fred's hearing, but Rosamond had opened the drawing-room door, and
now came forward anxiously. Lydgate apologized for Mr. Wrench, said
that the symptoms yesterday might have been disguising, and that this
form of fever was very equivocal in its beginnings: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would go
immediately to the druggist's and have a prescription made up in order
to lose no time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would write to Mr. Wrench and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) what had
been done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must come again--you must go on attending Fred. I can't have
my boy left to anybody who may come or not. I bear nobody ill-will,
thank God, and Mr. Wrench saved me in the pleurisy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>)'d better
have let me die--if--if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will meet Mr. Wrench here, then, shall I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, really
believing that Wrench was not well prepared to deal wisely with a case
of this kind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray make that arrangement, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
mother's aid, and supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) arm to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) away.

<p/>When Mr. Vincy came home he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was very angry with Wrench, and did not
care if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) never came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) house again. Lydgate should go on now,
whether Wrench liked it or not. It was no joke to have fever in the
house. Everybody must be sent to now, not to come to dinner on
Thursday. And Pritchard needn't get up any wine: brandy was the best
thing against infection. <div class="bookquote">``I shall drink brandy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>added Mr. Vincy,
emphatically--as much as to say, this was not an occasion for firing
with blank-cartridges. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)'s an uncommonly unfortunate lad, is Fred.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'d need have--some luck by-and-by to make up for all this--else I
don't know who'd have an eldest son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't say so, Vincy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, with a quivering lip, <div class="bookquote">``if you
don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to be taken from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will worret you to death, Lucy; _that_ I can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy,
more mildly. <div class="bookquote">``However, Wrench shall know what I think of the matter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>-LRB-What Mr. Vincy thought confusedly was, that the fever might somehow
have been hindered if Wrench had shown the proper solicitude about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)--the Mayor's--family.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``I'm the last man to give in to the cry
about new doctors, or new parsons either--whether they're Bulstrode's
men or not. But Wrench shall know what I think, take it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Wrench did not take it at all well. Lydgate was as polite as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could
be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) offhand way, but politeness in a man who has placed you at a
disadvantage is only an additional exasperation, especially if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
happens to have been an object of dislike beforehand. Country
practitioners used to be an irritable species, susceptible on the point
of honor; and Mr. Wrench was one of the most irritable among them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>)
did not refuse to meet Lydgate in the evening, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) temper was
somewhat tried on the occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had to hear Mrs. Vincy say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Wrench, what have I ever done that you should use me so?-- To
go away, and never to come again! And my boy might have been stretched
a corpse!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vincy, who had been keeping up a sharp fire on the enemy Infection,
and was a good deal heated in consequence, started up when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) heard
Wrench come in, and went into the hall to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what, Wrench, this is beyond a joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mayor</b></font>)</div>said the Mayor,
who of late had had to rebuke offenders with an official air, and how
broadened himself by putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) thumbs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) armholes.-- <div class="bookquote">``To let
fever get unawares into a house like this. There are some things that
ought to be actionable, and are not so-- that's my opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>But irrational reproaches were easier to bear than the sense of being
instructed, or rather the sense that a younger man, like Lydgate,
inwardly considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in need of instruction, for <div class="bookquote">``in point of fact,''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wrench afterwards said, Lydgate paraded flighty, foreign notions,
which would not wear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) swallowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ire for the moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
afterwards wrote to decline further attendance in the case. The house
might be a good one, but Mr. Wrench was not going to truckle to anybody
on a professional matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>) reflected, with much probability on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wrench</b></font>)
side, that Lydgate would by-and-by be caught tripping too, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
ungentlemanly attempts to discredit the sale of drugs by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
professional brethren, would by-and-by recoil on himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) threw out
biting remarks on Lydgate's tricks, worthy only of a quack, to get
himself a factitious reputation with credulous people. That cant about
cures was never got up by sound practitioners.

<p/>This was a point on which Lydgate smarted as much as Wrench could
desire. To be puffed by ignorance was not only humiliating, but
perilous, and not more enviable than the reputation of the
weather-prophet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was impatient of the foolish expectations amidst
which all work must be carried on, and likely enough to damage himself
as much as Mr. Wrench could wish, by an unprofessional openness.

<p/>However, Lydgate was installed as medical attendant on the Vincys, and
the event was a subject of general conversation in Middlemarch. Some
said, that the Vincys had behaved scandalously, that Mr. Vincy had
threatened Wrench, and that Mrs. Vincy had accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) of poisoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
son. Others were of opinion that Mr. Lydgate's passing by was
providential, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was wonderfully clever in fevers, and that
Bulstrode was in the right to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) forward. Many people believed
that Lydgate's coming to the town at all was really due to Bulstrode;
and Mrs. Taft, who was always counting stitches and gathered her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>)
information in misleading fragments caught between the rows of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>)
knitting, had got it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) head that Mr. Lydgate was a natural son
of Bulstrode's, a fact which seemed to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) suspicions of
evangelical laymen.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) one day communicated this piece of knowledge to Mrs. Farebrother,
who did not fail to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) son of it, observing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not be surprised at anything in Bulstrode, but I should be
sorry to think it of Mr. Lydgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, after an explosive laugh, <div class="bookquote">``you
know very well that Lydgate is of a good family in the North. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) never
heard of Bulstrode before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is satisfactory so far as Mr. Lydgate is concerned, Camden,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said
the old lady, with an air of precision.--<div class="bookquote">``But as to Bulstrode--the
report may be true of some other son.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII.

<p/>Let the high Muse chant loves Olympian:
We are but mortals, and must sing of man.


<p/>An eminent philosopher among my friends, who can dignify even your ugly
furniture by lifting it into the serene light of science, has shown me
this pregnant little fact. Your pier-glass or extensive surface of
polished steel made to be rubbed by a housemaid, will be minutely and
multitudinously scratched in all directions; but place now against it a
lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo! the scratches will
seem to arrange themselves in a fine series of concentric circles round
that little sun. It is demonstrable that the scratches are going
everywhere impartially and it is only your candle which produces the
flattering illusion of a concentric arrangement, its light falling with
an exclusive optical selection. These things are a parable. The
scratches are events, and the candle is the egoism of any person now
absent--of Miss Vincy, for example. Rosamond had a Providence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
own who had kindly made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) more charming than other girls, and who
seemed to have arranged Fred's illness and Mr. Wrench's mistake in
order to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and Lydgate within effective proximity. It would
have been to contravene these arrangements if Rosamond had consented to
go away to Stone Court or elsewhere, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) parents wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to do,
especially since Mr. Lydgate thought the precaution needless.
Therefore, while Miss Morgan and the children were sent away to a
farmhouse the morning after Fred's illness had declared itself,
Rosamond refused to leave papa and mamma.

<p/>Poor mamma indeed was an object to touch any creature born of woman;
and Mr. Vincy, who doted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) wife, was more alarmed on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) account
than on Fred's. But for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) insistence she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have taken no rest:
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brightness was all bedimmed; unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) costume which had
always been so fresh and gay, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was like a sick bird with languid eye
and plumage ruffled, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) senses dulled to the sights and sounds that
used most to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Fred's delirium, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) seemed to be
wandering out of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reach, tore her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart. After her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first outburst
against Mr. Wrench she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went about very quietly: her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) one low cry was to
Lydgate. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) out of the room and put her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
arm moaning out, <div class="bookquote">``Save my boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pleaded, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has always been
good to me, Mr. Lydgate: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) never had a hard word for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mother,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--as
if poor Fred's suffering were an accusation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). All the
deepest fibres of the mother's memory were stirred, and the young man
whose voice took a gentler tone when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), was one with the
babe whom she (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) had loved, with a love new to her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have good hope, Mrs. Vincy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate would say. <div class="bookquote">``Come down with me
and let us talk about the food.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In that way he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>babe</b></font>) to the parlor
where Rosamond was, and made a change for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), surprising her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into
taking some tea or broth which had been prepared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). There was a
constant understanding between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and Rosamond on these matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
almost always saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) before going to the sickroom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) appealed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could do for mamma. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) presence of mind and
adroitness in carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hints were admirable, and it is not
wonderful that the idea of seeing Rosamond began to mingle itself with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) interest in the case. Especially when the critical stage was
passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began to feel confident of Fred's recovery. In the more
doubtful time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had advised calling in Dr. Sprague -LRB-who, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) could,
would rather have remained neutral on Wrench's account-RRB-; but after two
consultations, the conduct of the case was left to Lydgate, and there
was every reason to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) assiduous. Morning and evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was at
Mr. Vincy's, and gradually the visits became cheerful as Fred became
simply feeble, and lay not only in need of the utmost petting but
conscious of it, so that Mrs. Vincy felt as if, after all, the illness
had made a festival for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) tenderness.

<p/>Both father and mother held it an added reason for good spirits, when
old Mr. Featherstone sent messages by Lydgate, saying that Fred must
make haste and get well, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), Peter Featherstone, could not do
without him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) visits sadly. The old man himself was
getting bedridden. Mrs. Vincy told these messages to Fred when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
could listen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) delicate, pinched face,
from which all the thick blond hair had been cut away, and in which the
eyes seemed to have got larger, yearning for some word about
Mary--wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) illness. No word passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
lips; but <div class="bookquote">``to hear with eyes belongs to love's rare wit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>and the
mother in the fulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart not only divined Fred's longing, but
felt ready for any sacrifice in order to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I can only see my boy strong again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loving folly;
<div class="bookquote">``and who knows?--perhaps master of Stone Court! and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) can marry
anybody he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) likes then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if they won't have me, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. The illness had made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) childish, and tears came as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, take a bit of jelly, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, secretly
incredulous of any such refusal.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) never left Fred's side when her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) husband was not in the house, and
thus Rosamond was in the unusual position of being much alone.
Lydgate, naturally, never thought of staying long with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), yet it
seemed that the brief impersonal conversations they had together were
creating that peculiar intimacy which consists in shyness. They were
obliged to look at each other in speaking, and somehow the looking
could not be carried through as the matter of course which it really
was. Lydgate began to feel this sort of consciousness unpleasant and
one day looked down, or anywhere, like an ill-worked puppet. But this
turned out badly: the next day, Rosamond looked down, and the
consequence was that when their eyes met again, both were more
conscious than before. There was no help for this in science, and as
Lydgate did not want to flirt, there seemed to be no help for it in
folly. It was therefore a relief when neighbors no longer considered
the house in quarantine, and when the chances of seeing Rosamond alone
were very much reduced.

<p/>But that intimacy of mutual embarrassment, in which each feels that the
other is feeling something, having once existed, its effect is not to
be done away with. Talk about the weather and other well-bred topics
is apt to seem a hollow device, and behavior can hardly become easy
unless it frankly recognizes a mutual fascination--which of course need
not mean anything deep or serious. This was the way in which Rosamond
and Lydgate slid gracefully into ease, and made their intercourse
lively again. Visitors came and went as usual, there was once more
music in the drawing-room, and all the extra hospitality of Mr. Vincy's
mayoralty returned. Lydgate, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) seat by
Rosamond's side, and lingered to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) music, calling himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
captive--meaning, all the while, not to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) captive. The
preposterousness of the notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>captive</b></font>) could at once set up a
satisfactory establishment as a married man was a sufficient guarantee
against danger. This play at being a little in love was agreeable, and
did not interfere with graver pursuits. Flirtation, after all, was not
necessarily a singeing process. Rosamond, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) part, had never
enjoyed the days so much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life before: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was sure of being
admired by some one worth captivating, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not distinguish
flirtation from love, either in herself or in another. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) seemed to
be sailing with a fair wind just whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would go, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thoughts
were much occupied with a handsome house in Lowick Gate which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hoped
would by-and-by be vacant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was quite determined, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was
married, to rid herself adroitly of all the visitors who were not
agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father's; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) imagined the drawing-room in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) favorite house with various styles of furniture.

<p/>Certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thoughts were much occupied with Lydgate himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) almost perfect: if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had known his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) notes so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
enchantment under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) music had been less like an emotional elephant's,
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been able to discriminate better the refinements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
taste in dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).
How different he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was from young Plymdale or Mr. Caius Larcher! Those
young men had not a notion of French, and could speak on no subject
with striking knowledge, except perhaps the dyeing and carrying trades,
which of course they were ashamed to mention; they were Middlemarch
gentry, elated with their silver-headed whips and satin stocks, but
embarrassed in their manners, and timidly jocose: even Fred was above
them, having at least the accent and manner of a university man.
Whereas Lydgate was always listened to, bore himself with the careless
politeness of conscious superiority, and seemed to have the right
clothes on by a certain natural affinity, without ever having to think
about them. Rosamond was proud when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) entered the room, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with a distinguishing smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had a delicious sense
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was the object of enviable homage. If Lydgate had been aware
of all the pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) excited in that delicate bosom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might have been
just as well pleased as any other man, even the most densely ignorant
of humoral pathology or fibrous tissue: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held it one of the prettiest
attitudes of the feminine mind to adore a man's pre-eminence without
too precise a knowledge of what it consisted in. But Rosamond was not
one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose
behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being
steered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) rapid
forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were
ever discernible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) conversation, even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mamma? On the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have expressed the prettiest surprise and
disapprobation if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had heard that another young lady had been
detected in that immodest prematureness--indeed, would probably have
disbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any
unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct
sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private
album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the
irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair
evil of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), pray: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or
mercenary; in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never thought of money except as something
necessary which other people would always provide. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not in the
habit of devising falsehoods, and if her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) statements were no direct clew
to fact, why, they were not intended in that light--they were among
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired
many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon's favorite pupil, who by general
consent -LRB-Fred's excepted-RRB- was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness,
and amiability.

<p/>Lydgate found it more and more agreeable to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lemon</b></font>), and there was
no constraint now, there was a delightful interchange of influence in
their eyes, and what they said had that superfluity of meaning for
them, which is observable with some sense of flatness by a third
person; still they had no interviews or asides from which a third
person need have been excluded. In fact, they flirted; and Lydgate was
secure in the belief that they did nothing else. If a man could not
love and be wise, surely he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could flirt and be wise at the same time?
Really, the men in Middlemarch, except Mr. Farebrother, were great
bores, and Lydgate did not care about commercial politics or cards:
what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to do for relaxation? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was often invited to the
Bulstrodes'; but the girls there were hardly out of the schoolroom; and
Mrs. Bulstrode's _naive_ way of conciliating piety and worldliness, the
nothingness of this life and the desirability of cut glass, the
consciousness at once of filthy rags and the best damask, was not a
sufficient relief from the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's invariable
seriousness. The Vincys' house, with all its faults, was the
pleasanter by contrast; besides, it nourished Rosamond--sweet to look
at as a half-opened blush-rose, and adorned with accomplishments for
the refined amusement of man.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made some enemies, other than medical, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) success with Miss
Vincy. One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came into the drawing-room rather late, when
several other visitors were there. The card-table had drawn off the
elders, and Mr. Ned Plymdale -LRB-one of the good matches in Middlemarch,
though not one of its leading minds-RRB- was in tete-a-tete with Rosamond.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) had brought the last <div class="bookquote">``Keepsake,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the gorgeous watered-silk
publication which marked modern progress at that time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>)
considered himself very fortunate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) could be the first to look
over it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), dwelling on the ladies and gentlemen with shiny
copper-plate cheeks and copper-plate smiles, and pointing to comic
verses as capital and sentimental stories as interesting. Rosamond was
gracious, and Mr. Ned was satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had the very best thing in
art and literature as a medium for <div class="bookquote">``paying addresses'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--the very thing
to please a nice girl. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) had also reasons, deep rather than
ostensible, for being satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) own appearance. To
superficial observers his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) chin had too vanishing an aspect, looking as
if it were being gradually reabsorbed. And it did indeed cause him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)
some difficulty about the fit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) satin stocks, for which chins were
at that time useful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the Honorable Mrs. S. is something like you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ned Plymdale/Mr. Plymdale/Mr. Ned</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Ned.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) kept the book open at the bewitching portrait, and looked at it
rather languishingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back is very large; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seems to have sat for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, not meaning any satire, but thinking how red young Plymdale's
hands were, and wondering why Lydgate did not come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went on with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tatting all the while.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not say she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was as beautiful as you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ned Plymdale/Mr. Plymdale/Mr. Ned</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Ned,
venturing to look from the portrait to its rival.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect you of being an adroit flatterer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, feeling
sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should have to reject this young gentleman a second time.

<p/>But now Lydgate came in; the book was closed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reached
Rosamond's corner, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) seat with easy confidence on the
other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), young Plymdale's jaw fell like a barometer towards
the cheerless side of change. Rosamond enjoyed not only Lydgate's
presence but its effect: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) liked to excite jealousy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What a late comer you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, as they shook hands. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma had
given you up a little while ago. How do you find Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As usual; going on well, but slowly. I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to go away--to Stone
Court, for example. But your mamma seems to have some objection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, prettily. <div class="bookquote">``You will see Fred so
changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) added, turning to the other suitor; <div class="bookquote">``we have looked to
Mr. Lydgate as our guardian angel during this illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the suitor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Ned smiled nervously, while Lydgate, drawing the <div class="bookquote">``Keepsake''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and opening it, gave a short scornful laugh and tossed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
chin, as if in wonderment at human folly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you laughing at so profanely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with bland
neutrality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder which would turn out to be the silliest--the engravings or
the writing here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) most convinced tone, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
turned over the pages quickly, seeming to see all through the book in
no time, and showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) large white hands to much advantage, as
Rosamond thought. <div class="bookquote">``Do look at this bridegroom coming out of church:
did you ever see such a `sugared invention'--as the Elizabethans used
to say? Did any haberdasher ever look so smirking? Yet I will answer
for it the story makes him (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) one of the first gentlemen in the land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so severe, I am frightened at you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
amusement duly moderate. Poor young Plymdale had lingered with
admiration over this very engraving, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) spirit was stirred.

<p/>``There are a great many celebrated people writing in the ``Keepsake,<div class="bookquote">'' at
all events,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) said, in a tone at once piqued and timid. <div class="bookquote">``This is the
first time I have heard it called silly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall turn round on you and accuse you of being a Goth,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, looking at Lydgate with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``I suspect you know
nothing about Lady Blessington and L. E. L.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)</div>Rosamond herself was not
without relish for these writers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not readily commit
herself by admiration, and was alive to the slightest hint that
anything was not, according to Lydgate, in the very highest taste.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But Sir Walter Scott--I suppose Mr. Lydgate knows him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Ned Plymdale/Mr. Plymdale/Mr. Ned</b></font>)</div>said young
Plymdale, a little cheered by this advantage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I read no literature now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, shutting the book, and
pushing it away. <div class="bookquote">``I read so much when I was a lad, that I suppose it
will last me all my life. I used to know Scott's poems by heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to know when you left off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``because then
I might be sure that I knew something which you did not know.''

purposely caustic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, showing no smart; but smiling with
exasperating confidence at Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``It would be worth knowing by the
fact that Miss Vincy could tell it me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Plymdale soon went to look at the whist-playing, thinking that
Lydgate was one of the most conceited, unpleasant fellows it had ever
been his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ill-fortune to meet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How rash you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, inwardly delighted. <div class="bookquote">``Do you see
that you have given offence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! is it Mr. Plymdale's book? I am sorry. I didn't think about
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall begin to admit what you said of yourself when you first came
here--that you are a bear, and want teaching by the birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there is a bird who can teach me what she (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) will. Don't I listen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) willingly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>To Rosamond it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and Lydgate were as good as engaged.
That they were some time to be engaged had long been an idea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
mind; and ideas, we know, tend to a more solid kind of existence, the
necessary materials being at hand. It is true, Lydgate had the
counter-idea of remaining unengaged; but this was a mere negative, a
shadow cast by other resolves which themselves were capable of
shrinking. Circumstance was almost sure to be on the side of
Rosamond's idea, which had a shaping activity and looked through
watchful blue eyes, whereas Lydgate's lay blind and unconcerned as a
jelly-fish which gets melted without knowing it.

<p/>That evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) phials to see how a
process of maceration was going on, with undisturbed interest; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
wrote out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) daily notes with as much precision as usual. The
reveries from which it was difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to detach himself were
ideal constructions of something else than Rosamond's virtues, and the
primitive tissue was still his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fair unknown. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
beginning to feel some zest for the growing though half-suppressed feud
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and the other medical men, which was likely to become more
manifest, now that Bulstrode's method of managing the new hospital was
about to be declared; and there were various inspiriting signs that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
non-acceptance by some of Peacock's patients might be counterbalanced
by the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had produced in other quarters. Only a few days
later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had happened to overtake Rosamond on the Lowick road and
had got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) horse to walk by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) side until he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had quite
protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from a passing drove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been stopped by a servant on
horseback with a message calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in to a house of some importance
where Peacock had never attended; and it was the second instance of
this kind. The servant was Sir James Chettam's, and the house was
Lowick Manor.



<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII.

<p/>1st Gent. All times are good to seek your wedded home
Bringing a mutual delight.

<p/>2d Gent. Why, true.
The calendar hath not an evil day
For souls made one by love, and even death
Were sweetness, if it came like rolling waves
While they two clasped each other, and foresaw
No life apart.


<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Casaubon, returning from their wedding journey, arrived at
Lowick Manor in the middle of January. A light snow was falling as
they descended at the door, and in the morning, when Dorothea passed
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dressing-room avenue the blue-green boudoir that we know of,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw the long avenue of limes lifting their trunks from a white
earth, and spreading white branches against the dun and motionless sky.
The distant flat shrank in uniform whiteness and low-hanging uniformity
of cloud. The very furniture in the room seemed to have shrunk since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw it before: the stag in the tapestry looked more like a ghost in
his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) ghostly blue-green world; the volumes of polite literature in the
bookcase looked more like immovable imitations of books. The bright
fire of dry oak-boughs burning on the logs seemed an incongruous
renewal of life and glow--like the figure of Dorothea herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
entered carrying the red-leather cases containing the cameos for Celia.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was glowing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) morning toilet as only healthful youth can
glow: there was gem-like brightness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) coiled hair and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) hazel
eyes; there was warm red life in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) lips; her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) throat had a breathing
whiteness above the differing white of the fur which itself seemed to
wind about her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) neck and cling down her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) blue-gray pelisse with a
tenderness gathered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own, a sentient commingled innocence which
kept its loveliness against the crystalline purity of the outdoor snow.
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) laid the cameo-cases on the table in the bow-window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
unconsciously kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) hands on them, immediately absorbed in looking
out on the still, white enclosure which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) visible world.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon, who had risen early complaining of palpitation, was in
the library giving audience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) curate Mr. Tucker. By-and-by Celia
would come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) quality of bridesmaid as well as sister, and through
the next weeks there would be wedding visits received and given; all in
continuance of that transitional life understood to correspond with the
excitement of bridal felicity, and keeping up the sense of busy
ineffectiveness, as of a dream which the dreamer begins to suspect.
The duties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) married life, contemplated as so great beforehand,
seemed to be shrinking with the furniture and the white vapor-walled
landscape. The clear heights where she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) expected to walk in full
communion had become difficult to see even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) imagination; the
delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken
into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment. When would the
days begin of that active wifely devotion which was to strengthen her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
husband's life and exalt her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own? Never perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had
preconceived them; but somehow--still somehow. In this solemnly
pledged union of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) life, duty would present itself in some new form
of inspiration and give a new meaning to wifely love.

<p/>Meanwhile there was the snow and the low arch of dun vapor--there was
the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman's world, where everything
was done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) and none asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) aid--where the sense of
connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up
painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims
that would have shaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) energies.-- <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whatever you
please, my dear:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) brief history since she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had left
off learning morning lessons and practising silly rhythms on the hated
piano. Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and
imperative occupation, had not yet freed her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) from the gentlewoman's
oppressive liberty: it had not even filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) leisure with the
ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) blooming full-pulsed youth
stood there in a moral imprisonment which made itself one with the
chill, colorless, narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the
never-read books, and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that
seemed to be vanishing from the daylight.

<p/>In the first minutes when Dorothea looked out she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt nothing but the
dreary oppression; then came a keen remembrance, and turning away from
the window she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked round the room. The ideas and hopes which were
living in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first saw this room nearly three months
before were present now only as memories: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) judged them as we judge
transient and departed things. All existence seemed to beat with a
lower pulse than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) religious faith was a solitary cry,
the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and
shrinking away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Each remembered thing in the room was
disenchanted, was deadened as an unlit transparency, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wandering
gaze came to the group of miniatures, and there at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw
something which had gathered new breath and meaning: it was the
miniature of Mr. Casaubon's aunt Julia, who had made the unfortunate
marriage--of Will Ladislaw's grandmother. Dorothea could fancy that
it was alive now--the delicate woman's face which yet had a headstrong
look, a peculiarity difficult to interpret. Was it only her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends
who thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage unfortunate? or did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself find it out to
be a mistake, and taste the salt bitterness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tears in the
merciful silence of the night? What breadths of experience Dorothea
seemed to have passed over since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first looked at this miniature!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt a new companionship with it, as if it had an ear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and
could see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking at it. Here was a woman who had known
some difficulty about marriage. Nay, the colors deepened, the lips and
chin seemed to get larger, the hair and eyes seemed to be sending out
light, the face was masculine and beamed on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with that full gaze
which tells her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on whom it falls that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is too interesting for the
slightest movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyelid to pass unnoticed and uninterpreted.
The vivid presentation came like a pleasant glow to Dorothea: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt
herself smiling, and turning from the miniature sat down and looked up
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were again talking to a figure in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). But the
smile disappeared as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on meditating, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said
aloud--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it was cruel to speak so! How sad--how dreadful!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose quickly and went out of the room, hurrying along the corridor,
with the irresistible impulse to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband and inquire if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr.
Casaubon was alone in the library. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt as if all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) morning's
gloom would vanish if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband glad because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
presence.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reached the head of the dark oak there was Celia coming
up, and below there was Mr. Brooke, exchanging welcomes and
congratulations with Mr. Casaubon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dodo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) quiet staccato; then kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister,
whose arms encircled her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>), and said no more. I think they both cried a
little in a furtive manner, while Dorothea ran down-stairs to greet her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need not ask how you are, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, after kissing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">``Rome has agreed with you, I see--happiness, frescos,
the antique--that sort of thing. Well, it's very pleasant to have you
back again, and you understand all about art now, eh? But Casaubon is
a little pale, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--a little pale, you know. Studying hard in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) holidays is carrying it rather too far. I overdid it at one
time'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Brooke still held Dorothea's hand, but had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) face
to Mr. Casaubon--<div class="bookquote">``about topography, ruins, temples--I thought I had a
clew, but I saw it would carry me too far, and nothing might come of
it. You may go any length in that sort of thing, and nothing may come
of it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's eyes also were turned up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's face with some
anxiety at the idea that those who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) afresh after absence might
be aware of signs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not noticed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to alarm you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
expression. <div class="bookquote">``A little English beef and mutton will soon make a
difference. It was all very well to look pale, sitting for the
portrait of Aquinas, you know--we got your letter just in time. But
Aquinas, now--he (<font color='blue'><b>Aquinas</b></font>) was a little too subtle, wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Aquinas</b></font>)? Does anybody read
Aquinas?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Aquinas</b></font>) is not indeed an author adapted to superficial minds,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Casaubon, meeting these timely questions with dignified patience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would like coffee in your own room, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, coming
to the rescue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; and you must go to Celia: she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) has great news to tell you, you
know. I leave it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>The blue-green boudoir looked much more cheerful when Celia was seated
there in a pelisse exactly like her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister's, surveying the cameos with
a placid satisfaction, while the conversation passed on to other topics.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think it nice to go to Rome on a wedding journey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia,
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) ready delicate blush which Dorothea was used to on the
smallest occasions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would not suit all--not you, dear, for example,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
quietly. No one would ever know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought of a wedding journey
to Rome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Cadwallader says it is nonsense, people going a long journey when
they are married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) says they get tired to death of each other, and
can't quarrel comfortably, as they would at home. And Lady Chettam
says she (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) went to Bath.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia's color changed again and again--seemed

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To come and go with tidings from the heart,
As it a running messenger had been.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>It must mean more than Celia's blushing usually did.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Celia! has something happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a tone full of
sisterly feeling. <div class="bookquote">``Have you really any great news to tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was because you went away, Dodo. Then there was nobody but me for
Sir James to talk to,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, with a certain roguishness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand. It is as I used to hope and believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's face between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) half
anxiously. Celia's marriage seemed more serious than it used to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only three days ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``And Lady Chettam is very
kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you are very happy?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. We are not going to be married yet. Because every thing is to
be got ready. And I don't want to be married so very soon, because I
think it is nice to be engaged. And we shall be married all our lives
after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do believe you could not marry better, Kitty. Sir James is a good,
honorable man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, warmly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has gone on with the cottages, Dodo. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will tell you about them
when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) comes. Shall you be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I shall. How can you ask me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only I was afraid you would be getting so learned,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia,
regarding Mr. Casaubon's learning as a kind of damp which might in due
time saturate a neighboring body.



<p/>CHAPTER XXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found that no genius in another could please me. My
unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of
comfort.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--GOLDSMITH.


<p/>One morning, some weeks after her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) arrival at Lowick, Dorothea--but why
always Dorothea? Was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) point of view the only possible one with
regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our
effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look
blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded, and will
know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.
In spite of the blinking eyes and white moles objectionable to Celia,
and the want of muscular curve which was morally painful to Sir James,
Mr. Casaubon had an intense consciousness within him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and was
spiritually a-hungered like the rest of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had done nothing
exceptional in marrying--nothing but what society sanctions, and
considers an occasion for wreaths and bouquets. It had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must not any longer defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) intention of matrimony, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
had reflected that in taking a wife, a man of good position should
expect and carefully choose a blooming young lady--the younger the
better, because more educable and submissive--of a rank equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own, of religious principles, virtuous disposition, and good
understanding. On such a young lady he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make handsome
settlements, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would neglect no arrangement for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) happiness: in
return, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should receive family pleasures and leave behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
copy of himself which seemed so urgently required of a man--to the
sonneteers of the sixteenth century. Times had altered since then, and
no sonneteer had insisted on Mr. Casaubon's leaving a copy of himself;
moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not yet succeeded in issuing copies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
mythological key; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had always intended to acquit himself by
marriage, and the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was fast leaving the years behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),
that the world was getting dimmer and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) felt lonely, was a reason
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) for losing no more time in overtaking domestic delights before
they too were left behind by the years.

<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had seen Dorothea he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had found even more
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) demanded: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might really be such a helpmate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as would
enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to dispense with a hired secretary, an aid which Mr.
Casaubon had never yet employed and had a suspicious dread of. -LRB-Mr.
Casaubon was nervously conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was expected to manifest a
powerful mind.-RRB- Providence, in its kindness, had supplied him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) with the
wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) needed. A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely
appreciative, unambitious abilities of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sex, is sure to think her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
husband's mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of
Miss Brooke in presenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could
hardly occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Society never made the preposterous demand that a
man should think as much about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own qualifications for making a
charming girl happy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks of hers for making himself happy. As
if a man could choose not only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's husband! Or as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were bound to provide charms for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) posterity in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
person!-- When Dorothea accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with effusion, that was only
natural; and Mr. Casaubon believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) happiness was going to
begin.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not had much foretaste of happiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) previous life. To
know intense joy without a strong bodily frame, one must have an
enthusiastic soul. Mr. Casaubon had never had a strong bodily frame,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) soul was sensitive without being enthusiastic: it was too
languid to thrill out of self-consciousness into passionate delight; it
went on fluttering in the swampy ground where it was hatched, thinking
of its wings and never flying. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) experience was of that pitiable
kind which shrinks from pity, and fears most of all that it should be
known: it was that proud narrow sensitiveness which has not mass enough
to spare for transformation into sympathy, and quivers thread-like in
small currents of self-preoccupation or at best of an egoistic
scrupulosity. And Mr. Casaubon had many scruples: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was capable of a
severe self-restraint; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was resolute in being a man of honor
according to the code; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would be unimpeachable by any recognized
opinion. In conduct these ends had been attained; but the difficulty
of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) Key to all Mythologies unimpeachable weighed like lead
upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind; and the pamphlets--or <div class="bookquote">``Parerga''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) called them--by
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) tested his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) public and deposited small monumental records of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) march, were far from having been seen in all their significance.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suspected the Archdeacon of not having read them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was in painful
doubt as to what was really thought of them by the leading minds of
Brasenose, and bitterly convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) old acquaintance Carp had
been the writer of that depreciatory recension which was kept locked in
a small drawer of Mr. Casaubon's desk, and also in a dark closet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
verbal memory. These were heavy impressions to struggle against, and
brought that melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all
excessive claim: even his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) religious faith wavered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wavering
trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own authorship, and the consolations of the Christian hope
in immortality seemed to lean on the immortality of the still unwritten
Key to all Mythologies. For my part I am very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>). It is an
uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to
enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be
liberated from a small hungry shivering self--never to be fully
possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness
rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a
passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and
uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted. Becoming a
dean or even a bishop would make little difference, I fear, to Mr.
Casaubon's uneasiness. Doubtless some ancient Greek has observed that
behind the big mask and the speaking-trumpet, there must always be our
poor little eyes peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less
under anxious control.

<p/>To this mental estate mapped out a quarter of a century before, to
sensibilities thus fenced in, Mr. Casaubon had thought of annexing
happiness with a lovely young bride; but even before marriage, as we
have seen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) found himself under a new depression in the consciousness
that the new bliss was not blissful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Inclination yearned back
to its old, easier custom. And the deeper he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) went in domesticity the
more did the sense of acquitting himself and acting with propriety
predominate over any other satisfaction. Marriage, like religion and
erudition, nay, like authorship itself, was fated to become an outward
requirement, and Edward Casaubon was bent on fulfilling unimpeachably
all requirements. Even drawing Dorothea into use in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) study,
according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own intention before marriage, was an effort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
was always tempted to defer, and but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pleading insistence it
might never have begun. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had succeeded in making it a matter of
course that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) place at an early hour in the library
and have work either of reading aloud or copying assigned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). The
work had been easier to define because Mr. Casaubon had adopted an
immediate intention: there was to be a new Parergon, a small monograph
on some lately traced indications concerning the Egyptian mysteries
whereby certain assertions of Warburton's could be corrected.
References were extensive even here, but not altogether shoreless; and
sentences were actually to be written in the shape wherein they would
be scanned by Brasenose and a less formidable posterity. These minor
monumental productions were always exciting to Mr. Casaubon; digestion
was made difficult by the interference of citations, or by the rivalry
of dialectical phrases ringing against each other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) brain. And
from the first there was to be a Latin dedication about which
everything was uncertain except that it was not to be addressed to
Carp: it was a poisonous regret to Mr. Casaubon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had once
addressed a dedication to Carp in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had numbered that member of
the animal kingdom among the viros nullo aevo perituros, a mistake
which would infallibly lay the dedicator open to ridicule in the next
age, and might even be chuckled over by Pike and Tench in the present.

<p/>Thus Mr. Casaubon was in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) busiest epochs, and as I began to
say a little while ago, Dorothea joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) early in the library where
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had breakfasted alone. Celia at this time was on a second visit to
Lowick, probably the last before her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) marriage, and was in the
drawing-room expecting Sir James.

<p/>Dorothea had learned to read the signs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's mood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going silently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) desk when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, in that distant tone
which implied that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was discharging a disagreeable duty--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, here is a letter for you, which was enclosed in one
addressed to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a letter of two pages, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) immediately looked at the
signature.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) have to say to me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) exclaimed, in a
tone of pleased surprise. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, looking at Mr. Casaubon,
<div class="bookquote">``I can imagine what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has written to you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can, if you please, read the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, severely
pointing to it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) pen, and not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But I may as
well say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to
pay a visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of
complete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto
inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes
their presence a fatigue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been no clashing of temper between Dorothea and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband
since that little explosion in Rome, which had left such strong traces
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind that it had been easier ever since to quell emotion than to
incur the consequence of venting it. But this ill-tempered
anticipation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could desire visits which might be disagreeable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, this gratuitous defence of himself against selfish
complaint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) part, was too sharp a sting to be meditated on until
after it had been resented. Dorothea had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could have
been patient with John Milton, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Milton</b></font>) behaving
in this way; and for a moment Mr. Casaubon seemed to be stupidly
undiscerning and odiously unjust. Pity, that <div class="bookquote">``new-born babe''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>which was
by-and-by to rule many a storm within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), did not <div class="bookquote">``stride the blast''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>on this occasion. With her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first words, uttered in a tone that shook
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) startled Mr. Casaubon into looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and meeting the
flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you attribute to me a wish for anything that would annoy you?
You speak to me as if I were something you had to contend against.
Wait at least till I appear to consult my own pleasure apart from
yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, you are hasty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Casaubon, nervously.

<p/>Decidedly, this woman was too young to be on the formidable level of
wifehood--unless she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been pale and featureless and taken
everything for granted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it was you who were first hasty in your false suppositions
about my feeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in the same tone. The fire was not
dissipated yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought it was ignoble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband not to
apologize to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will, if you please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I have
neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Casaubon dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) pen and made as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
writing, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hand trembled so much that the words seemed to be
written in an unknown character. There are answers which, in turning
away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a
discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own
side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.

<p/>Dorothea left Ladislaw's two letters unread on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
writing-table and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own place, the scorn and indignation
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rejecting the reading of these letters, just as we hurl away
any trash towards which we seem to have been suspected of mean
cupidity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not in the least divine the subtle sources of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's bad temper about these letters: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) only knew that they had
caused him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to offend her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) began to work at once, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand did
not tremble; on the contrary, in writing out the quotations which had
been given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the day before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was forming her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
letters beautifully, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw the construction
of the Latin she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was copying, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was beginning to
understand, more clearly than usual. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) indignation there was a
sense of superiority, but it went out for the present in firmness of
stroke, and did not compress itself into an inward articulate voice
pronouncing the once <div class="bookquote">``affable archangel''  (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div>a poor creature.

<p/>There had been this apparent quiet for half an hour, and Dorothea had
not looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own table, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heard the loud bang of a
book on the floor, and turning quickly saw Mr. Casaubon on the library
steps clinging forward as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were in some bodily distress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
started up and bounded towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in an instant: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was evidently in
great straits for breath. Jumping on a stool she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) got close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
elbow and said with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole soul melted into tender alarm--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you lean on me, dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was still for two or three minutes, which seemed endless to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
unable to speak or move, gasping for breath. When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) descended
the three steps and fell backward in the large chair which Dorothea had
drawn close to the foot of the ladder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) no longer gasped but seemed
helpless and about to faint. Dorothea rang the bell violently, and
presently Mr. Casaubon was helped to the couch: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not faint, and
was gradually reviving, when Sir James Chettam came in, having been met
in the hall with the news that Mr. Casaubon had <div class="bookquote">``had a fit in the
library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! this is just what might have been expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
immediate thought. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) prophetic soul had been urged to
particularize, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that <div class="bookquote">``fits''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>would have been the
definite expression alighted upon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) informant, the butler,
whether the doctor had been sent for. The butler never knew his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) master
to want the doctor before; but would it not be right to send for a
physician?

<p/>When Sir James entered the library, however, Mr. Casaubon could make
some signs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) usual politeness, and Dorothea, who in the reaction
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first terror had been kneeling and sobbing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) side now
rose and herself proposed that some one should ride off for a medical
man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I recommend you to send for Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``My mother has
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has found him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) uncommonly clever. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has had a
poor opinion of the physicians since my father's death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) made a silent sign of
approval. So Mr. Lydgate was sent for and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came wonderfully soon,
for the messenger, who was Sir James Chettam's man and knew Mr.
Lydgate, met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) horse along the Lowick road and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
arm to Miss Vincy.

<p/>Celia, in the drawing-room, had known nothing of the trouble till Sir
James told her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) of it. After Dorothea's account, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) no longer
considered the illness a fit, but still something <div class="bookquote">``of that nature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor dear Dodo--how dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, feeling as much grieved as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own perfect happiness would allow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) little hands were clasped,
and enclosed by Sir James's as a bud is enfolded by a liberal calyx.
<div class="bookquote">``It is very shocking that Mr. Casaubon should be ill; but I never did
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is not half fond enough of Dorothea; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
ought to be, for I am sure no one else would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--do you
think they would?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always thought it a horrible sacrifice of your sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. But poor Dodo never did do what other people do, and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
never will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a noble creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said the loyal-hearted Sir James. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had
just had a fresh impression of this kind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had seen Dorothea
stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tender arm under her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's neck and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
with unspeakable sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not know how much penitence there was
in the sorrow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, thinking it was very well for Sir James to say so,
but _he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)_ would not have been comfortable with Dodo. <div class="bookquote">``Shall I go to
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? Could I help her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think it would be well for you just to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) before Lydgate
comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, magnanimously. <div class="bookquote">``Only don't stay long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>While Celia was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) walked up and down remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had
originally felt about Dorothea's engagement, and feeling a revival of
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) disgust at Mr. Brooke's indifference. If Cadwallader--if every
one else had regarded the affair as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), Sir James, had done, the
marriage might have been hindered. It was wicked to let a young girl
blindly decide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fate in that way, without any effort to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
Sir James had long ceased to have any regrets on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own account: his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
heart was satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) engagement to Celia. But he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had a
chivalrous nature -LRB-was not the disinterested service of woman among the
ideal glories of old chivalry?-RRB-: his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) disregarded love had not turned to
bitterness; its death had made sweet odors--floating memories that
clung with a consecrating effect to Dorothea. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could remain her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
brotherly friend, interpreting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) actions with generous trustfulness.



<p/>CHAPTER XXX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Qui veut delasser hors de propos, lasse.'' (<font color='red'><b>Pascal/PASCAL</b></font>)</div>--PASCAL.


<p/>Mr. Casaubon had no second attack of equal severity with the first, and
in a few days began to recover his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) usual condition. But Lydgate seemed
to think the case worth a great deal of attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not only used
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stethoscope -LRB-which had not become a matter of course in practice at
that time-RRB-, but sat quietly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) patient and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). To Mr.
Casaubon's questions about himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) replied that the source of the
illness was the common error of intellectual men--a too eager and
monotonous application: the remedy was, to be satisfied with moderate
work, and to seek variety of relaxation. Mr. Brooke, who sat by on one
occasion, suggested that Mr. Casaubon should go fishing, as Cadwallader
did, and have a turning-room, make toys, table-legs, and that kind of
thing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In short, you recommend me to anticipate the arrival of my second
childhood,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said poor Mr. Casaubon, with some bitterness. <div class="bookquote">``These
things,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) added, looking at Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``would be to me such relaxation
as tow-picking is to prisoners in a house of correction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``amusement is rather an
unsatisfactory prescription. It is something like telling people to
keep up their spirits. Perhaps I had better say, that you must submit
to be mildly bored rather than to go on working.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. ``Get Dorothea to play backgammon with you
in the evenings. And shuttlecock, now--I don't know a finer game than
shuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be
sure, your eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend,
you know. Why, you might take to some light study: conchology, now: I
always think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you
light things, Smollett--``Roderick Random,'' <div class="bookquote">``Humphrey Clinker:' they
are a little broad, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) may read anything now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)'s married, you
know. I remember they made me laugh uncommonly--there's a droll bit
about a postilion's breeches. We have no such humor now. I have gone
through all these things, but they might be rather new to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Smollett Roderick Random</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As new as eating thistles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>would have been an answer to represent Mr.
Casaubon's feelings. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) only bowed resignedly, with due respect to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wife's uncle, and observed that doubtless the works he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mentioned
had <div class="bookquote">``served as a resource to a certain order of minds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate Casaubon</b></font>)</div>said the able magistrate to Lydgate, when they were outside
the door, <div class="bookquote">``Casaubon has been a little narrow: it leaves him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) rather at a
loss when you forbid him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) particular work, which I believe is
something very deep indeed--in the line of research, you know. I would
never give way to that; I was always versatile. But a clergyman is
tied a little tight. If they would make him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) a bishop, now!--he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) did a
very good pamphlet for Peel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) would have more movement then, more
show; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peel</b></font>) might get a little flesh. But I recommend you to talk to Mrs.
Casaubon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is clever enough for anything, is my niece. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) husband wants liveliness, diversion: put her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) on amusing tactics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Without Mr. Brooke's advice, Lydgate had determined on speaking to
Dorothea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not been present while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle was throwing out
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pleasant suggestions as to the mode in which life at Lowick might
be enlivened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was usually by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's side, and the
unaffected signs of intense anxiety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face and voice about
whatever touched his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind or health, made a drama which Lydgate was
inclined to watch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was only doing right in
telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the truth about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's probable future, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
certainly thought also that it would be interesting to talk
confidentially with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). A medical man likes to make psychological
observations, and sometimes in the pursuit of such studies is too
easily tempted into momentous prophecy which life and death easily set
at nought. Lydgate had often been satirical on this gratuitous
prediction, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant now to be guarded.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) asked for Mrs. Casaubon, but being told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was out walking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was going away, when Dorothea and Celia appeared, both glowing from
their struggle with the March wind. When Lydgate begged to speak with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) alone, Dorothea opened the library door which happened to be the
nearest, thinking of nothing at the moment but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might have to
say about Mr. Casaubon. It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had entered this
room since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband had been taken ill, and the servant had chosen
not to open the shutters. But there was light enough to read by from
the narrow upper panes of the windows.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not mind this sombre light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, standing in the
middle of the room. <div class="bookquote">``Since you forbade books, the library has been out
of the question. But Mr. Casaubon will soon be here again, I hope. Is
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) not making progress?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, much more rapid progress than I at first expected. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is
already nearly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) usual state of health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do not fear that the illness will return?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, whose
quick ear had detected some significance in Lydgate's tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such cases are peculiarly difficult to pronounce upon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.
<div class="bookquote">``The only point on which I can be confident is that it will be
desirable to be very watchful on Mr. Casaubon's account, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should
in any way strain his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) nervous power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I beseech you to speak quite plainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in an imploring
tone. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I
did not know, and which, if I had known it, would have made me act
differently.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The words came out like a cry: it was evident that they
were the voice of some mental experience which lay not very far off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, placing herself on the nearest chair, and
throwing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bonnet and gloves, with an instinctive discarding of
formality where a great question of destiny was concerned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What you say now justifies my own view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``I think it is
one's function as a medical man to hinder regrets of that sort as far
as possible. But I beg you to observe that Mr. Casaubon's case is
precisely of the kind in which the issue is most difficult to pronounce
upon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) may possibly live for fifteen years or more, without much
worse health than he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has had hitherto.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea had turned very pale, and when Lydgate paused she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said in a
low voice, <div class="bookquote">``You mean if we are very careful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--careful against mental agitation of all kinds, and against
excessive application.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would be miserable, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
with a quick prevision of that wretchedness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am aware of that. The only course is to try by all means, direct
and indirect, to moderate and vary his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) occupations. With a happy
concurrence of circumstances, there is, as I said, no immediate danger
from that affection of the heart, which I believe to have been the
cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) late attack. On the other hand, it is possible that the
disease may develop itself more rapidly: it is one of those cases in
which death is sometimes sudden. Nothing should be neglected which
might be affected by such an issue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence for a few moments, while Dorothea sat as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
been turned to marble, though the life within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was so intense that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind had never before swept in brief time over an equal range of
scenes and motives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Help me, pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, at last, in the same low voice as before.
<div class="bookquote">``Tell me what I can do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of foreign travel? You have been lately in Rome, I
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The memories which made this resource utterly hopeless were a new
current that shook Dorothea out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pallid immobility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that would not do--that would be worse than anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said
with a more childlike despondency, while the tears rolled down.
<div class="bookquote">``Nothing will be of any use that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does not enjoy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish that I could have spared you this pain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, deeply
touched, yet wondering about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage. Women just like Dorothea
had not entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) traditions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was right of you to tell me. I thank you for telling me the truth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you to understand that I shall not say anything to enlighten
Mr. Casaubon himself. I think it desirable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to know nothing
more than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must not overwork himself, and must observe certain
rules. Anxiety of any kind would be precisely the most unfavorable
condition for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate rose, and Dorothea mechanically rose at the same time,
unclasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cloak and throwing it off as if it stifled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
bowing and quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), when an impulse which if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been alone
would have turned into a prayer, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) say with a sob in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you are a wise man, are you not? You know all about life and
death. Advise me. Think what I can do. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been laboring all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
life and looking forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) minds about nothing else.-- And I mind
about nothing else--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For years after Lydgate remembered the impression produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) by
this involuntary appeal--this cry from soul to soul, without other
consciousness than their moving with kindred natures in the same
embroiled medium, the same troublous fitfully illuminated life. But
what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) say now except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should see Mr. Casaubon again
to-morrow?

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was gone, Dorothea's tears gushed forth, and relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
stifling oppression. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes, reminded that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
distress must not be betrayed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband; and looked round the room
thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must order the servant to attend to it as usual,
since Mr. Casaubon might now at any moment wish to enter. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
writing-table there were letters which had lain untouched since the
morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was taken ill, and among them, as Dorothea well
remembered, there were young Ladislaw's letters, the one addressed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) still unopened. The associations of these letters had been made
the more painful by that sudden attack of illness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that
the agitation caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anger might have helped to bring on: it
would be time enough to read them when they were again thrust upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had had no inclination to fetch them from the library. But now
it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that they should be put out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's sight:
whatever might have been the sources of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) annoyance about them, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
must, if possible, not be annoyed again; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ran her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes first
over the letter addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to assure herself whether or not it
would be necessary to write in order to hinder the offensive visit.

<p/>Will wrote from Rome, and began by saying that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) obligations to Mr.
Casaubon were too deep for all thanks not to seem impertinent. It was
plain that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were not grateful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must be the poorest-spirited
rascal who had ever found a generous friend. To expand in wordy thanks
would be like saying, <div class="bookquote">``I am honest.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>But Will had come to perceive that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) defects--defects which Mr. Casaubon had himself often pointed
to--needed for their correction that more strenuous position which his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
relative's generosity had hitherto prevented from being inevitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
trusted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should make the best return, if return were possible,
by showing the effectiveness of the education for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was
indebted, and by ceasing in future to need any diversion towards
himself of funds on which others might have a better claim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was
coming to England, to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) fortune, as many other young men were
obliged to do whose only capital was in their brains. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) friend
Naumann had desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Naumann</b></font>) to take charge of the <div class="bookquote">``Dispute'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--the picture
painted for Mr. Casaubon, with whose permission, and Mrs. Casaubon's,
Will would convey it to Lowick in person. A letter addressed to the
Poste Restante in Paris within the fortnight would hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>), if
necessary, from arriving at an inconvenient moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) enclosed a
letter to Mrs. Casaubon in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) continued a discussion about art,
begun with her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in Rome.

<p/>Opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own letter Dorothea saw that it was a lively continuation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) remonstrance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fanatical sympathy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) want of sturdy
neutral delight in things as they were--an outpouring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Restante</b></font>) young
vivacity which it was impossible to read just now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had immediately
to consider what was to be done about the other letter: there was still
time perhaps to prevent Will from coming to Lowick. Dorothea ended by
giving the letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle, who was still in the house, and begging
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to let Will know that Mr. Casaubon had been ill, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
health would not allow the reception of any visitors.

<p/>No one more ready than Mr. Brooke to write a letter: his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) only
difficulty was to write a short one, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ideas in this case
expanded over the three large pages and the inward foldings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
simply said to Dorothea--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, I will write, my dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a very clever young
fellow--this young Ladislaw--I dare say will be a rising young man.
It's a good letter--marks his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) sense of things, you know. However, I
will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) about Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>But the end of Mr. Brooke's pen was a thinking organ, evolving
sentences, especially of a benevolent kind, before the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind
could well overtake them. It expressed regrets and proposed remedies,
which, when Mr. Brooke read them, seemed felicitously
worded--surprisingly the right thing, and determined a sequel which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
had never before thought of. In this case, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pen found it such a pity
young Ladislaw should not have come into the neighborhood just at
that time, in order that Mr. Brooke might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) acquaintance more
fully, and that they might go over the long-neglected Italian drawings
together--it also felt such an interest in a young man who was starting
in life with a stock of ideas--that by the end of the second page it
had persuaded Mr. Brooke to invite young Ladislaw, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) could not
be received at Lowick, to come to Tipton Grange. Why not? They could
find a great many things to do together, and this was a period of
peculiar growth--the political horizon was expanding, and--in short,
Mr. Brooke's pen went off into a little speech which it had lately
reported for that imperfectly edited organ the <div class="bookquote">``Middlemarch Pioneer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>While Mr. Brooke was sealing this letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) felt elated with an influx
of dim projects:--a young man capable of putting ideas into form, the
<div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>purchased to clear the pathway for a new candidate, documents
utilized--who knew what might come of it all? Since Celia was going to
marry immediately, it would be very pleasant to have a young fellow at
table with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), at least for a time.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went away without telling Dorothea what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had put into the
letter, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was engaged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, and--in fact, these
things were of no importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XXXI.

<p/>How will you know the pitch of that great bell
Too large for you to stir? Let but a flute
Play `neath the fine-mixed metal listen close
Till the right note flows forth, a silvery rill.
Then shall the huge bell tremble--then the mass
With myriad waves concurrent shall respond
In low soft unison.


<p/>Lydgate that evening spoke to Miss Vincy of Mrs. Casaubon, and laid
some emphasis on the strong feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) appeared to have for that
formal studious man thirty years older than herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, implying a
notion of necessary sequence which the scientific man regarded as the
prettiest possible for a woman; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was thinking at the same time
that it was not so very melancholy to be mistress of Lowick Manor with
a husband likely to die soon. <div class="bookquote">``Do you think her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very handsome?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly is handsome, but I have not thought about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would be unprofessional,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, dimpling. <div class="bookquote">``But
how your practice is spreading! You were called in before to the
Chettams, I think; and now, the Casaubons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in a tone of compulsory admission. <div class="bookquote">``But I don't
really like attending such people so well as the poor. The cases are
more monotonous, and one has to go through more fuss and listen more
deferentially to nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not more than in Middlemarch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``And at least you go
through wide corridors and have the scent of rose-leaves everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true, Mademoiselle de Montmorenci,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, just bending
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head to the table and lifting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fourth finger her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) delicate
handkerchief which lay at the mouth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) reticule, as if to enjoy its
scent, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with a smile.

<p/>But this agreeable holiday freedom with which Lydgate hovered about the
flower of Middlemarch, could not continue indefinitely. It was not
more possible to find social isolation in that town than elsewhere, and
two people persistently flirting could by no means escape from <div class="bookquote">``the
various entanglements, weights, blows, clashings, motions, by which
things severally go on.''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Whatever Miss Vincy did must be remarked, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was perhaps the more conspicuous to admirers and critics because
just now Mrs. Vincy, after some struggle, had gone with Fred to stay a
little while at Stone Court, there being no other way of at once
gratifying old Featherstone and keeping watch against Mary Garth, who
appeared a less tolerable daughter-in-law in proportion as Fred's
illness disappeared.

<p/>Aunt Bulstrode, for example, came a little oftener into Lowick Gate to
see Rosamond, now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was alone. For Mrs. Bulstrode had a true
sisterly feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother; always thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have
married better, but wishing well to the children. Now Mrs. Bulstrode
had a long-standing intimacy with Mrs. Plymdale. They had nearly the
same preferences in silks, patterns for underclothing, china-ware, and
clergymen; they confided their little troubles of health and household
management to each other, and various little points of superiority on
Mrs. Bulstrode's side, namely, more decided seriousness, more
admiration for mind, and a house outside the town, sometimes served to
give color to their conversation without dividing them--well-meaning
women both, knowing very little of their own motives.

<p/>Mrs. Bulstrode, paying a morning visit to Mrs. Plymdale, happened to
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not stay longer, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was going to see poor
Rosamond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you say `poor Rosamond'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale, a round-eyed
sharp little woman, like a tamed falcon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) is so pretty, and has been brought up in such thoughtlessness.
The mother, you know, had always that levity about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), which makes me
anxious for the children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Harriet, if I am to speak my mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale, with
emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``I must say, anybody would suppose you and Mr. Bulstrode
would be delighted with what has happened, for you have done everything
to put Mr. Lydgate forward.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Selina, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, in genuine surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not but what I am truly thankful for Ned's sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) could certainly better afford to keep such a wife than some people
can; but I should wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) to look elsewhere. Still a mother has
anxieties, and some young men would take to a bad life in consequence.
Besides, if I was obliged to speak, I should say I was not fond of
strangers coming into a town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Selina,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, with a little emphasis in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) turn. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bulstrode was a stranger here at one time. Abraham and
Moses were strangers in the land, and we are told to entertain
strangers. And especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) added, after a slight pause, <div class="bookquote">``when
they are unexceptionable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not speaking in a religious sense, Harriet. I spoke as a
mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Selina, I am sure you have never heard me say anything against a niece
of mine marrying your son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is pride in Miss Vincy--I am sure it is nothing else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Plymdale, who had never before given all her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) confidence to
<div class="bookquote">``Harriet''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>on this subject. <div class="bookquote">``No young man in Middlemarch was good
enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>): I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mother say as much. That is not a
Christian spirit, I think. But now, from all I hear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has found a
man as proud as herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean that there is anything between Rosamond and Mr.
Lydgate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, rather mortified at finding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own
ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it possible you don't know, Harriet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I go about so little; and I am not fond of gossip; I really never
hear any. You see so many people that I don't see. Your circle is
rather different from ours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, but your own niece and Mr. Bulstrode's great favorite--and
yours too, I am sure, Harriet! I thought, at one time, you meant him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
for Kate, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) is a little older.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe there can be anything serious at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``My brother would certainly have told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, people have different ways, but I understand that nobody can see
Miss Vincy and Mr. Lydgate together without taking them to be engaged.
However, it is not my business. Shall I put up the pattern of mittens?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>After this Mrs. Bulstrode drove to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) niece with a mind newly
weighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was herself handsomely dressed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) noticed with a
little more regret than usual that Rosamond, who was just come in and
met her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in walking-dress, was almost as expensively equipped. Mrs.
Bulstrode was a feminine smaller edition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother, and had none
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's low-toned pallor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had a good honest glance and
used no circumlocution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are alone, I see, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, as they entered the
drawing-room together, looking round gravely. Rosamond felt sure that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt had something particular to say, and they sat down near each
other. Nevertheless, the quilling inside Rosamond's bonnet was so
charming that it was impossible not to desire the same kind of thing
for Kate, and Mrs. Bulstrode's eyes, which were rather fine, rolled
round that ample quilled circuit, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just heard something about you that has surprised me very much,
Rosamond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Rosamond's eyes also were roaming over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
aunt's large embroidered collar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can hardly believe it--that you should be engaged without my knowing
it--without your father's telling me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Here Mrs. Bulstrode's eyes
finally rested on Rosamond's, who blushed deeply, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not engaged, aunt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How is it that every one says so, then--that it is the town's talk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The town's talk is of very little consequence, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, inwardly gratified.

<p/>``Oh, my dear, be more thoughtful; don't despise your neighbors so.
Remember you are turned twenty-two now, and you will have no fortune:
your father, I am sure, will not be able to spare you anything. Mr.
Lydgate is very intellectual and clever; I know there is an attraction
in that. I like talking to such men myself; and your uncle finds him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
very useful. But the profession is a poor one here. To be sure, this
life is not everything; but it is seldom a medical man has true
religious views--there is too much pride of intellect. And you are not
fit to marry a poor man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate is not a poor man, aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has very high connections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) told me himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was poor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is used to people who have a high style of living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Rosamond, _you_ must not think of living in high style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond looked down and played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) reticule. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was not a fiery
young lady and had no sharp answers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) meant to live as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it is really true?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking very earnestly
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) niece. <div class="bookquote">``You are thinking of Mr. Lydgate--there is some
understanding between you, though your father doesn't know. Be open,
my dear Rosamond: Mr. Lydgate has really made you an offer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Rosamond's feelings were very unpleasant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been quite easy
as to Lydgate's feeling and intention, but now when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt put this
question she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not like being unable to say Yes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pride was hurt,
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) habitual control of manner helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray excuse me, aunt. I would rather not speak on the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not give your heart to a man without a decided prospect, I
trust, my dear. And think of the two excellent offers I know of that
you have refused!--and one still within your reach, if you will not
throw it away. I knew a very great beauty who married badly at last,
by doing so. Mr. Ned Plymdale is a nice young man--some might think
good-looking; and an only son; and a large business of that kind is
better than a profession. Not that marrying is everything. I would
have you seek first the kingdom of God. But a girl should keep her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
heart within her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should never give it to Mr. Ned Plymdale, if it were. I have
already refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>). If I loved, I should love at once and without
change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine,
and playing the part prettily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see how it is, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, in a melancholy voice,
rising to go. <div class="bookquote">``You have allowed your affections to be engaged without
return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are quite confident that Mr. Lydgate has a serious attachment
to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond's cheeks by this time were persistently burning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt
much mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chose to be silent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt went away all
the more convinced.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode in things worldly and indifferent was disposed to do what
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) now, without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reasons, desired
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) on the next opportunity to find out in conversation with Mr.
Lydgate whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had any intention of marrying soon. The result was
a decided negative. Mr. Bulstrode, on being cross-questioned, showed
that Lydgate had spoken as no man would who had any attachment that
could issue in matrimony. Mrs. Bulstrode now felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had a
serious duty before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) soon managed to arrange a tete-a-tete
with Lydgate, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) passed from inquiries about Fred Vincy's
health, and expressions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sincere anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother's large
family, to general remarks on the dangers which lay before young people
with regard to their settlement in life. Young men were often wild and
disappointing, making little return for the money spent on them, and a
girl was exposed to many circumstances which might interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
prospects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has great attractions, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) parents see much
company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>) attention, and engross
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>) all to themselves, for the mere pleasure of the moment, and that
drives off others. I think it is a heavy responsibility, Mr. Lydgate,
to interfere with the prospects of any girl.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Here Mrs. Bulstrode fixed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), with an unmistakable purpose of warning, if not of
rebuke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)--perhaps even staring a little
in return. <div class="bookquote">``On the other hand, a man must be a great coxcomb to go
about with a notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not pay attention to a young lady lest
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or lest others should think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Lydgate, you know well what your advantages are. You know
that our young men here cannot cope with you. Where you frequent a
house it may militate very much against a girl's making a desirable
settlement in life, and prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from accepting offers even if they
are made.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was less flattered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) advantage over the Middlemarch
Orlandos than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was annoyed by the perception of Mrs. Bulstrode's
meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had spoken as impressively as it was
necessary to do, and that in using the superior word <div class="bookquote">``militate''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still
evident enough.

<p/>Lydgate was fuming a little, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hair back with one hand, felt
curiously in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket with the other, and then stooped to
beckon the tiny black spaniel, which had the insight to decline his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hollow caresses. It would not have been decent to go away, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea. But Mrs.
Bulstrode, having no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been understood, turned the
conversation.

<p/>Solomon's Proverbs, I think, have omitted to say, that as the sore
palate findeth grit, so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes.
The next day Mr. Farebrother, parting from Lydgate in the street,
supposed that they should meet at Vincy's in the evening. Lydgate
answered curtly, no--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had work to do--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must give up going out in
the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! you are going to get lashed to the mast, eh, and are stopping
your ears?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``Well, if you don't mean to be won by the
sirens, you are right to take precautions in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>A few days before, Lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as
anything more than the Vicar's usual way of putting things. They
seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be
misunderstood: not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) believed, by Rosamond herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt
sure, took everything as lightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intended it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had an
exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners; but
the people she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lived among were blunderers and busybodies. However,
the mistake should go no farther. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) resolved--and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
resolution--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would not go to Mr. Vincy's except on business.

<p/>Rosamond became very unhappy. The uneasiness first stirred by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
aunt's questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
not seen Lydgate, it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly
come--into foreboding of that ready, fatal sponge which so cheaply
wipes out the hopes of mortals. The world would have a new dreariness
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), as a wilderness that a magician's spells had turned for a
little while into a garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was beginning to know
the pang of disappointed love, and that no other man could be the
occasion of such delightful aerial building as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been enjoying
for the last six months. Poor Rosamond lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) appetite and felt as
forlorn as Ariadne--as a charming stage Ariadne left behind with all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach.

<p/>There are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike
called love, and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an
apology for everything -LRB-in literature and the drama-RRB-. Happily Rosamond
did not think of committing any desperate act: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) plaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fair
hair as beautifully as usual, and kept herself proudly calm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) most
cheerful supposition was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt Bulstrode had interfered in some
way to hinder Lydgate's visits: everything was better than a
spontaneous indifference in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Any one who imagines ten days too
short a time--not for falling into leanness, lightness, or other
measurable effects of passion, but--for the whole spiritual circuit of
alarmed conjecture and disappointment, is ignorant of what can go on in
the elegant leisure of a young lady's mind.

<p/>On the eleventh day, however, Lydgate when leaving Stone Court was
requested by Mrs. Vincy to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) husband know that there was a marked
change in Mr. Featherstone's health, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) to come to
Stone Court on that day. Now Lydgate might have called at the
warehouse, or might have written a message on a leaf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pocket-book
and left it at the door. Yet these simple devices apparently did not
occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), from which we may conclude that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no strong
objection to calling at the house at an hour when Mr. Vincy was not at
home, and leaving the message with Miss Vincy. A man may, from various
motives, decline to give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) company, but perhaps not even a sage would
be gratified that nobody missed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It would be a graceful, easy way
of piecing on the new habits to the old, to have a few playful words
with Rosamond about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resistance to dissipation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) firm resolve
to take long fasts even from sweet sounds. It must be confessed, also,
that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for Mrs.
Bulstrode's hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs
into the more substantial web of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>Miss Vincy was alone, and blushed so deeply when Lydgate came in that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt a corresponding embarrassment, and instead of any playfulness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began at once to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reason for calling, and to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>),
almost formally, to deliver the message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) father. Rosamond, who
at the first moment felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) happiness were returning, was keenly
hurt by Lydgate's manner; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) blush had departed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) assented
coldly, without adding an unnecessary word, some trivial chain-work
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands enabling her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to avoid looking at Lydgate
higher than his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chin. In all failures, the beginning is certainly the
half of the whole. After sitting two long moments while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
whip and could say nothing, Lydgate rose to go, and Rosamond, made
nervous by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) struggle between mortification and the wish not to
betray it, dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chain as if startled, and rose too,
mechanically. Lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rose he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair
long neck which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been used to see turning about under the most
perfect management of self-contented grace. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes
now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) quite newly,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) look at Rosamond with a questioning flash. At this moment
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was as natural as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had ever been when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was five years old:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tears had risen, and it was no use to try to do
anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let
them fall over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cheeks, even as they would.

<p/>That moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather-touch: it
shook flirtation into love. Remember that the ambitious man who was
looking at those Forget-me-nots under the water was very warm-hearted
and rash. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know where the chain went; an idea had thrilled
through the recesses within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which had a miraculous effect in
raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed
sepulchre, but under the lightest, easily pierced mould. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words
were quite abrupt and awkward; but the tone made them sound like an
ardent, appealing avowal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter? you are distressed. Tell me, pray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before. I am not sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew what the words were: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) looked at Lydgate and the
tears fell over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cheeks. There could have been no more complete
answer than that silence, and Lydgate, forgetting everything else,
completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief
that this sweet young creature depended on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) joy, actually
put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) gently and protectingly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
used to being gentle with the weak and suffering--and kissed each of
the two large tears. This was a strange way of arriving at an
understanding, but it was a short way. Rosamond was not angry, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
moved backward a little in timid happiness, and Lydgate could now sit
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and speak less incompletely. Rosamond had to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) little
confession, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with
impulsive lavishment. In half an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) left the house an engaged
man, whose soul was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own, but the woman's to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had bound
himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came again in the evening to speak with Mr. Vincy, who, just
returned from Stone Court, was feeling sure that it would not be long
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) heard of Mr. Featherstone's demise. The felicitous word
<div class="bookquote">``demise,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which had seasonably occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>), had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) spirits
even above their usual evening pitch. The right word is always a
power, and communicates its definiteness to our action. Considered as
a demise, old Featherstone's death assumed a merely legal aspect, so
that Mr. Vincy could tap his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) snuff-box over it and be jovial, without
even an intermittent affectation of solemnity; and Mr. Vincy hated both
solemnity and affectation. Who was ever awe struck about a testator,
or sang a hymn on the title to real property? Mr. Vincy was inclined
to take a jovial view of all things that evening: he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) even observed to
Lydgate that Fred had got the family constitution after all, and would
soon be as fine a fellow as ever again; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) approbation of
Rosamond's engagement was asked for, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gave it with astonishing
facility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of
matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the
whole the appropriateness of a little more punch.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: Tempest.


<p/>The triumphant confidence of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone's
insistent demand that Fred and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother should not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), was a
feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the
old man's blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of
the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become
bedridden. Naturally: for when <div class="bookquote">``poor Peter''  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>had occupied his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm-chair
in the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook
prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which
they had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone
blood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from
poverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family
candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were
always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the
solemn act of making his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will would overlook the superior claims of
wealth. Themselves at least he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never been unnatural enough to
banish from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should
have kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no
shadow of such claims. They knew Peter's maxim, that money was a good
egg, and should be laid in a warm nest.

<p/>But Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all the needy exiles, held a
different point of view. Probabilities are as various as the faces to
be seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there,
from Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To
the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done
nothing for them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) would remember them at the last.
Jonah argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while
Martha said that nobody need be surprised if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) left the best part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) money to those who least expected it. Also it was not to be
thought but that an own brother <div class="bookquote">``lying there''  (<font color='red'><b>an brother</b></font>)</div>with dropsy in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) legs
must come to feel that blood was thicker than water, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) didn't
alter his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have money by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). At any rate some
blood-relations should be on the premises and on the watch against
those who were hardly relations at all. Such things had been known as
forged wills and disputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy
advantage of somehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again,
those who were no blood-relations might be caught making away with
things--and poor Peter <div class="bookquote">``lying there''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Featherstone</b></font>)</div>helpless! Somebody should be on
the watch. But in this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and
Jane; also, some nephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still
greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to <div class="bookquote">``will away''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man property</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property and give himself large treats of oddity, felt in a
handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended
to, and thought of Stone Court as a place which it would be nothing but
right for them to visit. Sister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living
with some wheeziness in the Chalky Flats, could not undertake the
journey; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) son, as being poor Peter's own nephew, could represent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) advantageously, and watch lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) uncle Jonah should make an
unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen. In
fact there was a general sense running in the Featherstone blood that
everybody must watch everybody else, and that it would be well for
everybody else to reflect that the Almighty was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>).

<p/>Thus Stone Court continually saw one or other blood-relation alighting
or departing, and Mary Garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their
messages to Mr. Featherstone, who would see none of them, and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so. As
manager of the household she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) felt bound to ask them in good provincial
fashion to stay and eat; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) chose to consult Mrs. Vincy on the
point of extra down-stairs consumption now that Mr. Featherstone was
laid up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, you must do things handsomely where there's last illness
and a property. God knows, I don't grudge them every ham in the
house--only, save the best for the funeral. Have some stuffed veal
always, and a fine cheese in cut. You must expect to keep open house
in these last illnesses,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said liberal Mrs. Vincy, once more of
cheerful note and bright plumage.

<p/>But some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome
treating to veal and ham. Brother Jonah, for example -LRB-there are such
unpleasant people in most families; perhaps even in the highest
aristocracy there are Brobdingnag specimens, gigantically in debt and
bloated at greater expense-RRB---Brother Jonah, I say, having come down in
the world, was mainly supported by a calling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) was modest enough
not to boast of, though it was much better than swindling either on
exchange or turf, but which did not require his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) presence at Brassing so
long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) chose
the kitchen-corner, partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) liked it best, and partly because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) did not want to sit with Solomon, concerning whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had a strong
brotherly opinion. Seated in a famous arm-chair and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) best suit,
constantly within sight of good cheer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had a comfortable
consciousness of being on the premises, mingled with fleeting
suggestions of Sunday and the bar at the Green Man; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) informed
Mary Garth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) should not go out of reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) brother Peter
while that poor fellow was above ground. The troublesome ones in a
family are usually either the wits or the idiots. Jonah was the wit
among the Featherstones, and joked with the maid-servants when they
came about the hearth, but seemed to consider Miss Garth a suspicious
character, and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) with cold eyes.

<p/>Mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease, but
unfortunately there was young Cranch, who, having come all the way from
the Chalky Flats to represent his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother and watch his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) uncle Jonah,
also felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) uncle company. Young Cranch was not exactly the balancing point
between the wit and the idiot,--verging slightly towards the latter
type, and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his (<font color='blue'><b>idiot</b></font>)
sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character. When
Mary Garth entered the kitchen and Mr. Jonah Featherstone began to
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) cold detective eyes, young Cranch turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) head
in the same direction seemed to insist on it that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cranch</b></font>) should remark how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was squinting, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) did it with design, like the gypsies when
Borrow read the New Testament to them. This was rather too much for
poor Mary; sometimes it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) bilious, sometimes it upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
gravity. One day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had an opportunity she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not resist
describing the kitchen scene to Fred, who would not be hindered from
immediately going to see it, affecting simply to pass through. But no
sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) face the four eyes than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had to rush through the
nearest door which happened to lead to the dairy, and there under the
high roof and among the pans he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave way to laughter which made a
hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) fled by another
doorway, but Mr. Jonah, who had not before seen Fred's white
complexion, long legs, and pinched delicacy of face, prepared many
sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined with
the lowest moral attributes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom, _you_ don't wear such gentlemanly trousers--you haven't got
half such fine long legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Jonah to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) nephew, winking at the
same time, to imply that there was something more in these statements
than their undeniableness. Tom looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) legs, but left it
uncertain whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) moral advantages to a more vicious
length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser.

<p/>In the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes
on the watch, and own relatives eager to be <div class="bookquote">``sitters-up.''  (<font color='red'><b>relatives</b></font>)</div>Many came,
lunched, and departed, but Brother Solomon and the lady who had been
Jane Featherstone for twenty-five years before she (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was Mrs. Waule found
it good to be there every day for hours, without other calculable
occupation than that of observing the cunning Mary Garth -LRB-who was so
deep that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could be found out in nothing-RRB- and giving occasional dry
wrinkly indications of crying--as if capable of torrents in a wetter
season--at the thought that they were not allowed to go into Mr.
Featherstone's room. For the old man's dislike of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own family
seemed to get stronger as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got less able to amuse himself by saying
biting things to them. Too languid to sting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the more venom
refluent in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood.

<p/>Not fully believing the message sent through Mary Garth, they had
presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom, both in
black--Mrs. Waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>)
hand--and both with faces in a sort of half-mourning purple; while Mrs.
Vincy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually
administering a cordial to their own brother, and the
light-complexioned Fred, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) short hair curling as might be expected in
a gambler's, was lolling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ease in a large chair.

<p/>Old Featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures
appearing in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) orders than rage came to strengthen him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) more
successfully than the cordial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was propped up on a bed-rest, and
always had his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gold-headed stick lying by him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) seized it now and
swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could,
apparently to ban these ugly spectres, crying in a hoarse sort of
screech--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Back, back, Mrs. Waule! Back, Solomon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Brother. Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Waule began--but Solomon put his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) hand
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) repressingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) was a large-cheeked man, nearly seventy,
with small furtive eyes, and was not only of much blander temper but
thought himself much deeper than his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) brother Peter; indeed not likely
to be deceived in any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not
well be more greedy and deceitful than he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) suspected them of being.
Even the invisible powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) thought, were likely to be soothed by a
bland parenthesis here and there--coming from a man of property, who
might have been as impious as others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother Peter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a wheedling yet gravely official tone,
<div class="bookquote">``It's nothing but right I should speak to you about the Three Crofts
and the Manganese. The Almighty knows what I've got on my mind--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) knows more than I want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Peter, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of
closer fighting, and looked hard at Solomon's bald head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's things you might repent of, Brother, for want of speaking to
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, not advancing, however. <div class="bookquote">``I could sit up with you
to-night, and Jane with me, willingly, and you might take your own time
to speak, or let me speak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall take my own time--you needn't offer me yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Peter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you can't take your own time to die in, Brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>began Mrs.
Waule, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) usual woolly tone. <div class="bookquote">``And when you lie speechless you
may be tired of having strangers about you, and you may think of me and
my children'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--but here her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) voice broke under the touching thought which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) was attributing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) speechless brother; the mention of ourselves
being naturally affecting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I shan't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said old Featherstone, contradictiously. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't
think of any of you. I've made my will, I tell you, I've made my
will.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) head towards Mrs. Vincy, and swallowed some
more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) cordial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to
others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) narrow eyes in the same direction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, with ironical softness, <div class="bookquote">``you and me are not
fine, and handsome, and clever enough: we must be humble and let smart
people push themselves before us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred's spirit could not bear this: rising and looking at Mr.
Featherstone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Shall my mother and I leave the room, sir, that
you may be alone with your friends?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, I tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said old Featherstone, snappishly. <div class="bookquote">``Stop where
you are. Good-by, Solomon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) added, trying to wield his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) stick again,
but failing now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had reversed the handle. <div class="bookquote">``Good-by, Mrs. Waule.
Don't you come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be down-stairs, Brother, whether or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall do my duty, and it remains to be seen what the Almighty will
allow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in property going out of families,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, in
continuation,--<div class="bookquote">``and where there's steady young men to carry on. But I
pity them who are not such, and I pity their mothers. Good-by, Brother
Peter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, I'm the eldest after you, Brother, and prospered from the
first, just as you did, and have got land already by the name of
Featherstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon, relying much on that reflection, as one
which might be suggested in the watches of the night. <div class="bookquote">``But I bid you
good-by for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div><p/>Their exit was hastened by their seeing old Mr. Featherstone pull his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
wig on each side and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) mouth-widening grimace, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) were determined to be deaf and blind.

<p/>None the less they came to Stone Court daily and sat below at the post
of duty, sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which
the observation and response were so far apart, that any one hearing
them might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata, in
some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work, or wind
itself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent. Solomon and
Jane would have been sorry to be quick: what that led to might be seen
on the other side of the wall in the person of Brother Jonah.

<p/>But their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the
presence of other guests from far or near. Now that Peter Featherstone
was up-stairs, his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) property could be discussed with all that local
enlightenment to be found on the spot: some rural and Middlemarch
neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with
their interest against the Vincys, and feminine visitors were even
moved to tears, in conversation with Mrs. Waule, when they recalled the
fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by
codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly
gentlemen, who, it might have been supposed, had been spared for
something better. Such conversation paused suddenly, like an organ
when the bellows are let drop, if Mary Garth came into the room; and
all eyes were turned on her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) as a possible legatee, or one who might get
access to iron chests.

<p/>But the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family,
were disposed to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) in this problematic light, as a girl who
showed much conduct, and who among all the chances that were flying
might turn out to be at least a moderate prize. Hence she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
share of compliments and polite attentions.

<p/>Especially from Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, a distinguished bachelor and
auctioneer of those parts, much concerned in the sale of land and
cattle: a public character, indeed, whose name was seen on widely
distributed placards, and who might reasonably be sorry for those who
did not know of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was second cousin to Peter Featherstone, and
had been treated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) with more amenity than any other relative,
being useful in matters of business; and in that programme of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
funeral which the old man had himself dictated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had been named as a
Bearer. There was no odious cupidity in Mr. Borthrop Trumbull--nothing
more than a sincere sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) own merit, which, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was aware, in
case of rivalry might tell against competitors; so that if Peter
Featherstone, who so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), Trumbull, was concerned, had
behaved like as good a soul as ever breathed, should have done anything
handsome by him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>), all he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) could say was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had never fished and
fawned, but had advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) experience, which now
extended over twenty years from the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) apprenticeship at
fifteen, and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) admiration was far from being confined to himself, but was
accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating
things at a high rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was an amateur of superior phrases, and
never used poor language without immediately correcting himself--which
was fortunate, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was rather loud, and given to predominate,
standing or walking about frequently, pulling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) waistcoat with
the air of a man who is very much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) own opinion, trimming himself
rapidly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) fore-finger, and marking each new series in these
movements by a busy play with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) large seals. There was occasionally
a little fierceness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) demeanor, but it was directed chiefly
against false opinion, of which there is so much to correct in the
world that a man of some reading and experience necessarily has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
patience tried. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that the Featherstone family generally was of
limited understanding, but being a man of the world and a public
character, took everything as a matter of course, and even went to
converse with Mr. Jonah and young Cranch in the kitchen, not doubting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) had impressed the latter greatly by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) leading questions
concerning the Chalky Flats. If anybody had observed that Mr. Borthrop
Trumbull, being an auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of
everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the
sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) came pretty near that. On the whole, in an auctioneering
way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was an honorable man, not ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) business, and feeling
that <div class="bookquote">``the celebrated Peel, now Sir Robert,''  (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div>if introduced to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>), would
not fail to recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind if I have a slice of that ham, and a glass of that ale,
Miss Garth, if you will allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) said, coming into the parlor at
half-past eleven, after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing
old Featherstone, and standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) back to the fire between Mrs.
Waule and Solomon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not necessary for you to go out;--let me ring the bell.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, <div class="bookquote">``I have an errand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Mr. Trumbull, you're highly favored,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What! seeing the old man?''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer, playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) seals
dispassionately. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you see he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has relied on me considerably.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here
he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) lips together, and frowned meditatively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Might anybody ask what their brother has been saying?''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon,
in a soft tone of humility, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had a sense of luxurious
cunning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) being a rich man and not in need of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, anybody may ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, with loud and
good-humored though cutting sarcasm. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody may interrogate. Any
one may give their remarks an interrogative turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) continued, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
sonorousness rising with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) style. <div class="bookquote">``This is constantly done by good
speakers, even when they anticipate no answer. It is what we call a
figure of speech--speech at a high figure, as one may say.''  (<font color='red'><b>The auctioneer</b></font>)</div>The
eloquent auctioneer smiled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) own ingenuity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't be sorry to hear he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'d remembered you, Mr. Trumbull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said
Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``I never was against the deserving. It's the undeserving I'm
against.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there it is, you see, there it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull,
significantly. <div class="bookquote">``It can't be denied that undeserving people have been
legatees, and even residuary legatees. It is so, with testamentary
dispositions.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) pursed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) lips and frowned a little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say for certain, Mr. Trumbull, that my brother has left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) land away from our family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, on whom, as an
unhopeful woman, those long words had a depressing effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A man might as well turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) land into charity land at once as leave
it to some people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>observed Solomon, his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) sister's question having
drawn no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Blue-Coat land?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, again. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Mr. Trumbull, you
never can mean to say that. It would be flying in the face of the
Almighty that's prospered him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div><p/>While Mrs. Waule was speaking, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull walked away from
the fireplace towards the window, patrolling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) fore-finger round
the inside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) stock, then along his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) whiskers and the curves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
hair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) now walked to Miss Garth's work-table, opened a book which
lay there and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) were
offering it for sale:

<p/>''`Anne of Geierstein' -LRB-pronounced Jeersteen-RRB- or the ``Maiden of the
Mist, by the author of Waverley.''' Then turning the page, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) began
sonorously--<div class="bookquote">``The course of four centuries has well-nigh elapsed since
the series of events which are related in the following chapters took
place on the Continent.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) pronounced the last truly admirable word
with the accent on the last syllable, not as unaware of vulgar usage,
but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) reading had given to the whole.

<p/>And now the servant came in with the tray, so that the moments for
answering Mrs. Waule's question had gone by safely, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) and
Solomon, watching Mr. Trumbull's movements, were thinking that high
learning interfered sadly with serious affairs. Mr. Borthrop Trumbull
really knew nothing about old Featherstone's will; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) could hardly
have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had been arrested
for misprision of treason.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) said,
reassuringly. <div class="bookquote">``As a man with public business, I take a snack when I
can. I will back this ham,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) added, after swallowing some morsels
with alarming haste, <div class="bookquote">``against any ham in the three kingdoms. In my
opinion it is better than the hams at Freshitt Hall--and I think I am
a tolerable judge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some don't like so much sugar in their hams,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule. <div class="bookquote">``But
my poor brother would always have sugar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If any person demands better, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is at liberty to do so; but, God
bless me, what an aroma! I should be glad to buy in that quality, I
know. There is some gratification to a gentleman'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>--here Mr.
Trumbull's voice conveyed an emotional remonstrance--<div class="bookquote">``in having this
kind of ham set on his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) pushed aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) plate, poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) glass of ale and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
chair a little forward, profiting by the occasion to look at the inner
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) legs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) stroked approvingly--Mr. Trumbull having
all those less frivolous airs and gestures which distinguish the
predominant races of the north.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have an interesting work there, I see, Miss Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) observed,
when Mary re-entered. ``It is by the author of ``Waverley': that is Sir
Walter Scott. I have bought one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) works myself--a very nice
thing, a very superior publication, entitled <div class="bookquote">``Ivanhoe.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You will not
get any writer to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) in a hurry, I think--he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) will not, in my
opinion, be speedily surpassed. I have just been reading a portion at
the commencement of <div class="bookquote">``Anne of Jeersteen.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It commences well.'' -LRB-Things

subscribe to our Middlemarch library?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fred Vincy brought this book.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a great bookman myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Trumbull. <div class="bookquote">``I have no less
than two hundred volumes in calf, and I flatter myself they are well
selected. Also pictures by Murillo, Rubens, Teniers, Titian, Vandyck,

Miss Garth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, hastening away again, <div class="bookquote">``but I have
little time for reading.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should say my brother has done something for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)_ in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Solomon/Mr. Solomon Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Solomon, in a very low undertone, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had shut the door
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) head towards the absent Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) first wife was a poor match for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nothing: and this young woman is only her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) niece,--and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A sensible girl though, in my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, finishing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) ale and starting up with an emphatic adjustment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) waistcoat.
<div class="bookquote">``I have observed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been mixing medicine in drops. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

great point for our friend up-stairs, poor dear old soul. A man whose
life is of any value should think of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife as a nurse: that is what
I should do, if I married; and I believe I have lived single long
enough not to make a mistake in that line. Some men must marry to
elevate themselves a little, but when I am in need of that, I hope some
one will tell me so--I hope some individual will apprise me of the
fact. I wish you good morning, Mrs. Waule. Good morning, Mr. Solomon.
I trust we shall meet under less melancholy auspices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. Trumbull had departed with a fine bow, Solomon, leaning
forward, observed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``You may depend, Jane, my brother has

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody would think so, from the way Mr. Trumbull talks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Jane.

<p/>That night after twelve o'clock Mary Garth relieved the watch in Mr.
Featherstone's room, and sat there alone through the small hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
often chose this task, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) found some pleasure,
notwithstanding the old man's testiness whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
attentions. There were intervals in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could sit perfectly
still, enjoying the outer stillness and the subdued light. The red
fire with its gently audible movement seemed like a solemn existence
calmly independent of the petty passions, the imbecile desires, the
straining after worthless uncertainties, which were daily moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
contempt. Mary was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own thoughts, and could amuse herself
well sitting in twilight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap; for, having early
had strong reason to believe that things were not likely to be arranged
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) peculiar satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wasted no time in astonishment and
annoyance at that fact. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had already come to take life very
much as a comedy in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a proud, nay, a generous resolution
not to act the mean or treacherous part. Mary might have become
cynical if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not had parents whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) honored, and a well of
affectionate gratitude within her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), which was all the fuller because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had learned to make no unreasonable claims.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat to-night revolving, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was wont, the scenes of the day, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
lips often curling with amusement at the oddities to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) fancy
added fresh drollery: people were so ridiculous with their illusions,
carrying their fool's caps unawares, thinking their own lies opaque
while everybody else's were transparent, making themselves exceptions
to everything, as if when all the world looked yellow under a lamp they
alone were rosy. Yet there were some illusions under Mary's eyes which
were not quite comic to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was secretly convinced, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had no other grounds than her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) close observation of old Featherstone's
nature, that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) fondness for having the Vincys about him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>),
they were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
kept at a distance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a good deal of disdain for Mrs. Vincy's
evident alarm lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) and Fred should be alone together, but it did
not hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) from thinking anxiously of the way in which Fred would
be affected, if it should turn out that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) as poor
as ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) could make a butt of Fred when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was present, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
did not enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) follies when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was absent.

<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thoughts: a vigorous young mind not overbalanced by
passion, finds a good in making acquaintance with life, and watches its
own powers with interest. Mary had plenty of merriment within.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought was not veined by any solemnity or pathos about the old man
on the bed: such sentiments are easier to affect than to feel about an
aged creature whose life is not visibly anything but a remnant of
vices. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always seen the most disagreeable side of Mr.
Featherstone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was not proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was only useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>).
To be anxious about a soul that is always snapping at you must be left
to the saints of the earth; and Mary was not one of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
never returned him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) a harsh word, and had waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) faithfully: that
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) utmost. Old Featherstone himself was not in the least anxious
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) soul, and had declined to see Mr. Tucker on the subject.

<p/>To-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) had not snapped, and for the first hour or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) lay
remarkably still, until at last Mary heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) bunch of
keys against the tin box which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) always kept in the bed beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>).
About three o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) said, with remarkable distinctness, <div class="bookquote">``Missy, come
here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary obeyed, and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) had already drawn the tin box from under
the clothes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) usually asked to have this done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>)
had selected the key. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tucker</b></font>) now unlocked the box, and, drawing from it
another key, looked straight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with eyes that seemed to have
recovered all their sharpness and said, <div class="bookquote">``How many of 'em are in the
house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean of your own relations, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, well used to the old
man's way of speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded slightly and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jonah Featherstone and young Cranch are sleeping here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh ay, they stick, do they? and the rest--they come every day, I'll
warrant--Solomon and Jane, and all the young uns? They come peeping,
and counting and casting up?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not all of them every day. Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule are here every
day, and the others come often.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man listened with a grimace while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spoke, and then said,
relaxing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">``The more fools they. You hearken, missy. It's
three o'clock in the morning, and I've got all my faculties as well as
ever I had in my life. I know all my property, and where the money's
put out, and everything. And I've made everything ready to change my
mind, and do as I like at the last. Do you hear, missy? I've got my
faculties.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, quietly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone with an air of deeper cunning. <div class="bookquote">``I've made two
wills, and I'm going to burn one. Now you do as I tell you. This is
the key of my iron chest, in the closet there. You push well at the
side of the brass plate at the top, till it goes like a bolt: then you
can put the key in the front lock and turn it. See and do that; and
take out the topmost paper--Last Will and Testament--big printed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, in a firm voice, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not do it? I tell you, you must,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man voice</b></font>)</div>said the old man, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice
beginning to shake under the shock of this resistance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot touch your iron chest or your will. I must refuse to do
anything that might lay me open to suspicion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, I'm in my right mind. Shan't I do as I like at the last?
I made two wills on purpose. Take the key, I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, sir, I will not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, more resolutely still. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) repulsion
was getting stronger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, there's no time to lose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help that, sir. I will not let the close of your life soil
the beginning of mine. I will not touch your iron chest or your will.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moved to a little distance from the bedside.

<p/>The old man paused with a blank stare for a little while, holding the
one key erect on the ring; then with an agitated jerk he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) began to work
with his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) bony left hand at emptying the tin box before him (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) began to say, hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``look here! take the money--the
notes and gold--look here--take it--you shall have it all--do as I
tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) made an effort to stretch out the key towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) as far as
possible, and Mary again retreated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don't ask me to do
it again. If you do, I must go and call your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) hand fall, and for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life Mary saw old
Peter Featherstone begin to cry childishly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, in as gentle a
tone as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could command, <div class="bookquote">``Pray put up your money, sir;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and then went
away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seat by the fire, hoping this would help to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
that it was useless to say more. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) rallied and said
eagerly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, then. Call the young chap. Call Fred Vincy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's heart began to beat more quickly. Various ideas rushed through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind as to what the burning of a second will might imply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
to make a difficult decision in a hurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will call him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), if you will let me call Mr. Jonah and others with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody else, I say. The young chap. I shall do as I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait till broad daylight, sir, when every one is stirring. Or let me
call Simmons now, to go and fetch the lawyer? He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) can be here in less
than two hours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lawyer? What do I want with the lawyer? Nobody shall know--I say,
nobody shall know. I shall do as I like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me call some one else, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, persuasively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) position--alone with the old man, who seemed to show a strange
flaring of nervous energy which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to speak again and again
without falling into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual cough; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) desired not to push
unnecessarily the contradiction which agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let me, pray,
call some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You let me alone, I say. Look here, missy. Take the money. You'll
never have the chance again. It's pretty nigh two hundred--there's
more in the box, and nobody knows how much there was. Take it and do
as I tell you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary, standing by the fire, saw its red light falling on the old man,
propped up on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillows and bed-rest, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bony hand holding out
the key, and the money lying on the quilt before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never forgot
that vision of a man wanting to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked at the last. But the
way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put the offer of the money urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to speak with
harder resolution than ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of no use, sir. I will not do it. Put up your money. I will
not touch your money. I will do anything else I can to comfort you;
but I will not touch your keys or your money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else anything else!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said old Featherstone, with hoarse rage,
which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just
audible. <div class="bookquote">``I want nothing else. You come here--you come here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) cautiously, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) too well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) keys and trying to grasp his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) stick, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
like an aged hyena, the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) face getting distorted with the
effort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) paused at a safe distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me give you some cordial,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``and try to compose
yourself. You will perhaps go to sleep. And to-morrow by daylight you
can do as you like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) lifted the stick, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) being beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) reach, and threw
it with a hard effort which was but impotence. It fell, slipping over
the foot of the bed. Mary let it lie, and retreated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) chair by
the fire. By-and-by she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) with the cordial. Fatigue
would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) passive. It was getting towards the chillest moment of
the morning, the fire had got low, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could see through the chink
between the moreen window-curtains the light whitened by the blind.
Having put some wood on the fire and thrown a shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sat
down, hoping that Mr. Featherstone might now fall asleep. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went
near him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) the irritation might be kept up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) had said nothing after
throwing the stick, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) keys again and
laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) right hand on the money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) did not put it up, however, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was dropping off to sleep.

<p/>But Mary herself began to be more agitated by the remembrance of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had gone through, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been by the reality--questioning
those acts of hers which had come imperatively and excluded all
question in the critical moment.

<p/>Presently the dry wood sent out a flame which illuminated every
crevice, and Mary saw that the old man was lying quietly with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head
turned a little on one side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with inaudible
steps, and thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face looked strangely motionless; but the
next moment the movement of the flame communicating itself to all
objects made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncertain. The violent beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart rendered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) perceptions so doubtful that even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) touched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and listened
for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) conclusions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went to
the window and gently propped aside the curtain and blind, so that the
still light of the sky fell on the bed.

<p/>The next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ran to the bell and rang it energetically. In a
very little while there was no longer any doubt that Peter Featherstone
was dead, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) right hand clasping the keys, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) left hand
lying on the heap of notes and gold.





<p/>BOOK IV.





<p/>THREE LOVE PROBLEMS.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV.

<p/>1st Gent. Such men as this are feathers, chips, and straws.
Carry no weight, no force.
2d Gent. But levity
Is causal too, and makes the sum of weight.
For power finds its place in lack of power;
Advance is cession, and the driven ship
May run aground because the helmsman's thought
Lacked force to balance opposites.''


<p/>It was on a morning of May that Peter Featherstone was buried. In the
prosaic neighborhood of Middlemarch, May was not always warm and sunny,
and on this particular morning a chill wind was blowing the blossoms
from the surrounding gardens on to the green mounds of Lowick
churchyard. Swiftly moving clouds only now and then allowed a gleam to
light up any object, whether ugly or beautiful, that happened to stand
within its golden shower. In the churchyard the objects were
remarkably various, for there was a little country crowd waiting to see
the funeral. The news had spread that it was to be a <div class="bookquote">``big burying;''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the old gentleman had left written directions about everything and
meant to have a funeral <div class="bookquote">``beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) betters.''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>This was true; for old
Featherstone had not been a Harpagon whose passions had all been
devoured by the ever-lean and ever-hungry passion of saving, and who
would drive a bargain with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) undertaker beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) loved money,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) also loved to spend it in gratifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) peculiar tastes, and
perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) loved it best of all as a means of making others feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
power more or less uncomfortably. If any one will here contend that
there must have been traits of goodness in old Featherstone, I will not
presume to deny this; but I must observe that goodness is of a modest
nature, easily discouraged, and when much privacy, elbowed in early
life by unabashed vices, is apt to retire into extreme privacy, so that
it is more easily believed in by those who construct a selfish old
gentleman theoretically, than by those who form the narrower judgments
based on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) personal acquaintance. In any case, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been bent on
having a handsome funeral, and on having persons <div class="bookquote">``bid''  (<font color='red'><b>persons</b></font>)</div>to it who would
rather have stayed at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had even desired that female relatives
should follow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to the grave, and poor sister Martha had taken a
difficult journey for this purpose from the Chalky Flats. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) and Jane
would have been altogether cheered -LRB-in a tearful manner-RRB- by this sign
that a brother who disliked seeing them while he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was living had been
prospectively fond of their presence when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should have become a
testator, if the sign had not been made equivocal by being extended to
Mrs. Vincy, whose expense in handsome crape seemed to imply the most
presumptuous hopes, aggravated by a bloom of complexion which told
pretty plainly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was not a blood-relation, but of that generally
objectionable class called wife's kin.

<p/>We are all of us imaginative in some form or other, for images are the
brood of desire; and poor old Featherstone, who laughed much at the way
in which others cajoled themselves, did not escape the fellowship of
illusion. In writing the programme for his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) burial he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) certainly did not
make clear to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) pleasure in the little drama of which it
formed a part was confined to anticipation. In chuckling over the
vexations he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) could inflict by the rigid clutch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) dead hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
inevitably mingled his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) consciousness with that livid stagnant presence,
and so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was preoccupied with a future life, it was with one of
gratification inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) coffin. Thus old Featherstone was
imaginative, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) fashion.

<p/>However, the three mourning-coaches were filled according to the
written orders of the deceased. There were pall-bearers on horseback,
with the richest scarfs and hatbands, and even the under-bearers had
trappings of woe which were of a good well-priced quality. The black
procession, when dismounted, looked the larger for the smallness of the
churchyard; the heavy human faces and the black draperies shivering in
the wind seemed to tell of a world strangely incongruous with the
lightly dropping blossoms and the gleams of sunshine on the daisies.
The clergyman who met the procession was Mr. Cadwallader--also
according to the request of Peter Featherstone, prompted as usual by
peculiar reasons. Having a contempt for curates, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) always called
understrappers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was resolved to be buried by a beneficed clergyman.
Mr. Casaubon was out of the question, not merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) declined
duty of this sort, but because Featherstone had an especial dislike to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) as the rector of his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) own parish, who had a lien on the land in the
shape of tithe, also as the deliverer of morning sermons, which the old
man, being in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pew and not at all sleepy, had been obliged to sit
through with an inward snarl. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an objection to a parson stuck up
above his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head preaching to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations with Mr.
Cadwallader had been of a different kind: the trout-stream which ran
through Mr. Casaubon's land took its course through Featherstone's
also, so that Mr. Cadwallader was a parson who had had to ask a favor
instead of preaching. Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) was one of the high gentry living
four miles away from Lowick, and was thus exalted to an equal sky with
the sheriff of the county and other dignities vaguely regarded as
necessary to the system of things. There would be a satisfaction in
being buried by Mr. Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine
opportunity for pronouncing wrongly if you liked.

<p/>This distinction conferred on the Rector of Tipton and Freshitt was the
reason why Mrs. Cadwallader made one of the group that watched old
Featherstone's funeral from an upper window of the manor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) was not
fond of visiting that house, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) liked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) said, to see
collections of strange animals such as there would be at this funeral;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) had persuaded Sir James and the young Lady Chettam to drive the
Rector and herself to Lowick in order that the visit might be
altogether pleasant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go anywhere with you, Mrs. Cadwallader,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia had said; <div class="bookquote">``but I
don't like funerals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, when you have a clergyman in your family you must
accommodate your tastes: I did that very early. When I married
Humphrey I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by liking the
end very much. That soon spread to the middle and the beginning,
because I couldn't have the end without them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, to be sure not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dowager</b></font>)</div>said the Dowager Lady Chettam, with stately
emphasis.

<p/>The upper window from which the funeral could be well seen was in the
room occupied by Mr. Casaubon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been forbidden to work; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had resumed nearly his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) habitual style of life now in spite of
warnings and prescriptions, and after politely welcoming Mrs.
Cadwallader had slipped again into the library to chew a cud of erudite
mistake about Cush and Mizraim.

<p/>But for her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) visitors Dorothea too might have been shut up in the
library, and would not have witnessed this scene of old Featherstone's
funeral, which, aloof as it seemed to be from the tenor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life,
always afterwards came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at the touch of certain sensitive
points in memory, just as the vision of St. Peter's at Rome was inwoven
with moods of despondency. Scenes which make vital changes in our
neighbors' lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a
particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for
us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity
which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.

<p/>The dream-like association of something alien and ill-understood with
the deepest secrets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience seemed to mirror that sense of
loneliness which was due to the very ardor of Dorothea's nature. The
country gentry of old time lived in a rarefied social air: dotted apart
on their stations up the mountain they looked down with imperfect
discrimination on the belts of thicker life below. And Dorothea was
not at ease in the perspective and chilliness of that height.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not look any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, after the train had entered
the church, placing herself a little behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband's elbow so that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) could slyly touch his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say Dodo likes
it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am fond of knowing something about the people I live among,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, who had been watching everything with the interest of a monk
on his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) holiday tour. <div class="bookquote">``It seems to me we know nothing of our neighbors,
unless they are cottagers. One is constantly wondering what sort of
lives other people lead, and how they take things. I am quite obliged
to Mrs. Cadwallader for coming and calling me out of the library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right to feel obliged to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``Your rich
Lowick farmers are as curious as any buffaloes or bisons, and I dare
say you don't half see them at church. They are quite different from
your uncle's tenants or Sir James's--monsters--farmers without
landlords--one can't tell how to class them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Most of these followers are not Lowick people,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James; <div class="bookquote">``I
suppose they are legatees from a distance, or from Middlemarch.
Lovegood tells me the old fellow has left a good deal of money as well
as land.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of that now! when so many younger sons can't dine at their own
expense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``Ah,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>turning round at the sound of
the opening door, <div class="bookquote">``here is Mr. Brooke. I felt that we were incomplete
before, and here is the explanation. You are come to see this odd
funeral, of course?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I came to look after Casaubon--to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) goes on, you know.
And to bring a little news--a little news, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,
nodding at Dorothea as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). ``I looked into the
library, and I saw Casaubon over his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) books. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) it wouldn't do:
I said, ``This will never do, you know: think of your wife, Casaubon.<div class="bookquote">''
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) promised me to come up. I didn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) my news: I said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
must come up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, now they are coming out of church,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Cadwallader exclaimed.
<div class="bookquote">``Dear me, what a wonderfully mixed set! Mr. Lydgate as doctor, I
suppose. But that is really a good looking woman, and the fair young
man must be her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son. Who are they, Sir James, do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see Vincy, the Mayor of Middlemarch; they are probably his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) wife and
son,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, looking interrogatively at Mr. Brooke, who nodded
and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a very decent family--a very good fellow is Vincy; a credit to
the manufacturing interest. You have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at my house, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, yes: one of your secret committee,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader,
provokingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A coursing fellow, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with a fox-hunter's
disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And one of those who suck the life out of the wretched handloom
weavers in Tipton and Freshitt. That is how his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) family look so fair
and sleek,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``Those dark, purple-faced people
are an excellent foil. Dear me, they are like a set of jugs! Do look
at Humphrey: one might fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) an ugly archangel towering above them
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Humphrey</b></font>) white surplice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a solemn thing, though, a funeral,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``if you take
it in that light, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I am not taking it in that light. I can't wear my solemnity too
often, else it will go to rags. It was time the old man died, and none
of these people are sorry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How piteous!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``This funeral seems to me the most
dismal thing I ever saw. It is a blot on the morning I cannot bear to
think that any one should die and leave no love behind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to say more, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband enter and seat
himself a little in the background. The difference his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence made
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not always a happy one: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) often inwardly
objected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Positively,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Cadwallader, <div class="bookquote">``there is a new face come out
from behind that broad man queerer than any of them: a little round
head with bulging eyes--a sort of frog-face--do look. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be of
another blood, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, with awakened curiosity, standing behind Mrs.
Cadwallader and leaning forward over her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what an odd face!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then with a quick change to another sort of surprised expression, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``Why, Dodo, you never told me that Mr. Ladislaw was come again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt a shock of alarm: every one noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sudden paleness
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked up immediately at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle, while Mr. Casaubon looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) came with me, you know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is my guest--puts up with me at the
Grange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) easiest tone, nodding at Dorothea, as
if the announcement were just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have expected. <div class="bookquote">``And we
have brought the picture at the top of the carriage. I knew you would
be pleased with the surprise, Casaubon. There you are to the very
life--as Aquinas, you know. Quite the right sort of thing. And you
will hear young Ladislaw talk about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) talks uncommonly
well--points out this, that, and the other--knows art and everything of
that kind--companionable, you know--is up with you in any track--what
I've been wanting a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon bowed with cold politeness, mastering his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) irritation, but
only so far as to be silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) remembered Will's letter quite as well
as Dorothea did; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had noticed that it was not among the letters which
had been reserved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) recovery, and secretly concluding that
Dorothea had sent word to Will not to come to Lowick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had shrunk
with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) now
inferred that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle to invite Will to the Grange; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt it impossible at that moment to enter into any explanation.

<p/>Mrs. Cadwallader's eyes, diverted from the churchyard, saw a good deal
of dumb show which was not so intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) could have
desired, and could not repress the question, <div class="bookquote">``Who is Mr. Ladislaw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A young relative of Mr. Casaubon's,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, promptly. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
good-nature often made him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) quick and clear-seeing in personal matters,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had divined from Dorothea's glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband that there was
some alarm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A very nice young fellow--Casaubon has done everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>explained Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) repays your expense in him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
went on, nodding encouragingly. <div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will stay with me a long
while and we shall make something of my documents. I have plenty of
ideas and facts, you know, and I can see he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is just the man to put them
into shape--remembers what the right quotations are, omne tulit
punctum, and that sort of thing--gives subjects a kind of turn. I
invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) some time ago when you were ill, Casaubon; Dorothea said
you couldn't have anybody in the house, you know, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) asked me to
write.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Dorothea felt that every word of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's was about as pleasant
as a grain of sand in the eye to Mr. Casaubon. It would be altogether
unfitting now to explain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle to invite
Will Ladislaw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not in the least make clear to herself the
reasons for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's dislike to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence--a dislike painfully
impressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) by the scene in the library; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt the
unbecomingness of saying anything that might convey a notion of it to
others. Mr. Casaubon, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those
mixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), as with all of
us, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
wished to repress outward signs, and only Dorothea could discern the
changes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's face before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) observed with more of dignified
bending and sing-song than usual--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are exceedingly hospitable, my dear sir; and I owe you
acknowledgments for exercising your hospitality towards a relative of
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The funeral was ended now, and the churchyard was being cleared.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you can see him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), Mrs. Cadwallader,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is just like
a miniature of Mr. Casaubon's aunt that hangs in Dorothea's
boudoir--quite nice-looking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A very pretty sprig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, dryly. <div class="bookquote">``What is your
nephew to be, Mr. Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pardon me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is not my nephew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is my cousin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>interposed Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
is just the sort of young fellow to rise. I should be glad to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
an opportunity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would make a good secretary, now, like Hobbes,
Milton, Swift--that sort of man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``One who can write speeches.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Swift</b></font>) in now, eh, Casaubon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wouldn't
come in till I had announced him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), you know. And we'll go down and look
at the picture. There you are to the life: a deep subtle sort of
thinker with his (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) fore-finger on the page, while Saint Bonaventure or
somebody else, rather fat and florid, is looking up at the Trinity.
Everything is symbolical, you know--the higher style of art: I like
that up to a certain point, but not too far--it's rather straining to
keep up with, you know. But you are at home in that, Casaubon. And
your painter's flesh is good--solidity, transparency, everything of
that sort. I went into that a great deal at one time. However, I'll
go and fetch Ladislaw.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXXV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Non, je ne comprends pas de plus charmant plaisir
Que de voir d'heritiers une troupe affligee
Le maintien interdit, et la mine allongee,
Lire un long testament ou pales, etonnes
On leur laisse un bonsoir avec un pied de nez.
Pour voir au naturel leur tristesse profonde
Je reviendrais, je crois, expres de l'autre monde.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--REGNARD: Le Legataire Universel.


<p/>When the animals entered the Ark in pairs, one may imagine that allied
species made much private remark on each other, and were tempted to
think that so many forms feeding on the same store of fodder were
eminently superfluous, as tending to diminish the rations. -LRB-I fear the
part played by the vultures on that occasion would be too painful for
art to represent, those birds being disadvantageously naked about the
gullet, and apparently without rites and ceremonies.-RRB-

<p/>The same sort of temptation befell the Christian Carnivora who formed
Peter Featherstone's funeral procession; most of them having their
minds bent on a limited store which each would have liked to get the
most of. The long-recognized blood-relations and connections by
marriage made already a goodly number, which, multiplied by
possibilities, presented a fine range for jealous conjecture and
pathetic hopefulness. Jealousy of the Vincys had created a fellowship
in hostility among all persons of the Featherstone blood, so that in
the absence of any decided indication that one of themselves was to
have more than the rest, the dread lest that long-legged Fred Vincy
should have the land was necessarily dominant, though it left abundant
feeling and leisure for vaguer jealousies, such as were entertained
towards Mary Garth. Solomon found time to reflect that Jonah was
undeserving, and Jonah to abuse Solomon as greedy; Jane, the elder
sister, held that Martha's children ought not to expect so much as the
young Waules; and Martha, more lax on the subject of primogeniture, was
sorry to think that Jane was so <div class="bookquote">``having.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Featherstone</b></font>)</div>These nearest of kin were
naturally impressed with the unreasonableness of expectations in
cousins and second cousins, and used their arithmetic in reckoning the
large sums that small legacies might mount to, if there were too many
of them. Two cousins were present to hear the will, and a second
cousin besides Mr. Trumbull. This second cousin was a Middlemarch
mercer of polite manners and superfluous aspirates. The two cousins
were elderly men from Brassing, one of them conscious of claims on the
score of inconvenient expense sustained by him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in presents of oysters
and other eatables to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) rich cousin Peter; the other entirely
saturnine, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hands and chin on a stick, and conscious of
claims based on no narrow performance but on merit generally: both
blameless citizens of Brassing, who wished that Jonah Featherstone did
not live there. The wit of a family is usually best received among
strangers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Trumbull himself is pretty sure of five hundred--_that_ you may
depend,--I shouldn't wonder if my brother promised him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon,
musing aloud with his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) sisters, the evening before the funeral.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said poor sister Martha, whose imagination of hundreds
had been habitually narrowed to the amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) unpaid rent.

<p/>But in the morning all the ordinary currents of conjecture were
disturbed by the presence of a strange mourner who had plashed among
them as if from the moon. This was the stranger described by Mrs.
Cadwallader as frog-faced: a man perhaps about two or three and thirty,
whose prominent eyes, thin-lipped, downward-curved mouth, and hair
sleekly brushed away from a forehead that sank suddenly above the ridge
of the eyebrows, certainly gave his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face a batrachian unchangeableness
of expression. Here, clearly, was a new legatee; else why was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
bidden as a mourner? Here were new possibilities, raising a new
uncertainty, which almost checked remark in the mourning-coaches. We
are all humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed
very comfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we
have been making up our world entirely without it. No one had seen
this questionable stranger before except Mary Garth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) knew
nothing more of him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) than that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had twice been to Stone Court when Mr.
Featherstone was down-stairs, and had sat alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) for several
hours. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had found an opportunity of mentioning this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) father,
and perhaps Caleb's were the only eyes, except the lawyer's, which
examined the stranger with more of inquiry than of disgust or
suspicion. Caleb Garth, having little expectation and less cupidity,
was interested in the verification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own guesses, and the calmness
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) half smilingly rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) chin and shot intelligent
glances much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) were valuing a tree, made a fine contrast with
the alarm or scorn visible in other faces when the unknown mourner,
whose name was understood to be Rigg, entered the wainscoted parlor and
took his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) seat near the door to make part of the audience when the will
should be read. Just then Mr. Solomon and Mr. Jonah were gone
up-stairs with the lawyer to search for the will; and Mrs. Waule,
seeing two vacant seats between herself and Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, had
the spirit to move next to that great authority, who was handling his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
watch-seals and trimming his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) outlines with a determination not to show
anything so compromising to a man of ability as wonder or surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you know everything about what my poor brother's done, Mr.
Trumbull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, in the lowest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) woolly tones, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) crape-shadowed bonnet towards Mr. Trumbull's ear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good lady, whatever was told me was told in confidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the
auctioneer, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) hand up to screen that secret.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Them who've made sure of their good-luck may be disappointed yet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Waule continued, finding some relief in this communication.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hopes are often delusive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, still in confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, looking across at the Vincys, and then moving
back to the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) sister Martha.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's wonderful how close poor Peter was,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>) said, in the same
undertones. <div class="bookquote">``We none of us know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) might have had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind. I
only hope and trust he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wasn't a worse liver than we think of, Martha.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cranch/Cranch</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mrs. Cranch was bulky, and, breathing asthmatically, had the
additional motive for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Cranch</b></font>) remarks unexceptionable and giving
them a general bearing, that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Cranch</b></font>) whispers were loud and liable to
sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel-organ.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never _was_ covetous, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Cranch</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``but I have six children
and have buried three, and I didn't marry into money. The eldest, that
sits there, is but nineteen--so I leave you to guess. And stock always
short, and land most awkward. But if ever I've begged and prayed; it's
been to God above; though where there's one brother a bachelor and the
other childless after twice marrying--anybody might think!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, Mr. Vincy had glanced at the passive face of Mr. Rigg, and
had taken out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) snuff-box and tapped it, but had put it again
unopened as an indulgence which, however clarifying to the judgment,
was unsuited to the occasion. <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't wonder if Featherstone had
better feelings than any of us gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) credit for,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) observed, in
the ear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``This funeral shows a thought about everybody: it
looks well when a man wants to be followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends, and if they
are humble, not to be ashamed of them. I should be all the better
pleased if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d left lots of small legacies. They may be uncommonly
useful to fellows in a small way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything is as handsome as could be, crape and silk and everything,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, contentedly.

<p/>But I am sorry to say that Fred was under some difficulty in repressing
a laugh, which would have been more unsuitable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's
snuff-box. Fred had overheard Mr. Jonah suggesting something about a
<div class="bookquote">``love-child,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>and with this thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind, the stranger's face,
which happened to be opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), affected him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) too ludicrously. Mary
Garth, discerning his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) distress in the twitchings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mouth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
recourse to a cough, came cleverly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) rescue by asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to
change seats with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) got into a shadowy corner. Fred was
feeling as good-naturedly as possible towards everybody, including
Rigg; and having some relenting towards all these people who were less
lucky than he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) was aware of being himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) would not for the world
have behaved amiss; still, it was particularly easy to laugh.

<p/>But the entrance of the lawyer and the two brothers drew every one's
attention. The lawyer was Mr. Standish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) had come to Stone Court
this morning believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) knew thoroughly well who would be
pleased and who disappointed before the day was over. The will he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>)
expected to read was the last of three which he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) had drawn up for Mr.
Featherstone. Mr. Standish was not a man who varied his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) manners: he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>)
behaved with the same deep-voiced, off-hand civility to everybody, as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) saw no difference in them, and talked chiefly of the hay-crop,
which would be <div class="bookquote">``very fine, by God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of the last bulletins concerning
the King, and of the Duke of Clarence, who was a sailor every inch of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Clarence</b></font>), and just the man to rule over an island like Britain.

<p/>Old Featherstone had often reflected as he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) sat looking at the fire that
Standish would be surprised some day: it is true that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) had done as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) liked at the last, and burnt the will drawn up by another lawyer, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)
would not have secured that minor end; still he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) pleasure in
ruminating on it. And certainly Mr. Standish was surprised, but not at
all sorry; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) rather enjoyed the zest of a little
curiosity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) own mind, which the discovery of a second will added
to the prospective amazement on the part of the Featherstone family.

<p/>As to the sentiments of Solomon and Jonah, they were held in utter
suspense: it seemed to them that the old will would have a certain
validity, and that there might be such an interlacement of poor Peter's
former and latter intentions as to create endless <div class="bookquote">``lawing''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Featherstone</b></font>)</div>before
anybody came by their own--an inconvenience which would have at least
the advantage of going all round. Hence the brothers showed a
thoroughly neutral gravity as they re-entered with Mr. Standish; but
Solomon took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) white handkerchief again with a sense that in any
case there would be affecting passages, and crying at funerals, however
dry, was customarily served up in lawn.

<p/>Perhaps the person who felt the most throbbing excitement at this
moment was Mary Garth, in the consciousness that it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) who had
virtually determined the production of this second will, which might
have momentous effects on the lot of some persons present. No soul
except herself knew what had passed on that final night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The will I hold in my hand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish, who, seated at the
table in the middle of the room, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) time about everything,
including the coughs with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) showed a disposition to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>)
voice, <div class="bookquote">``was drawn up by myself and executed by our deceased friend on
the 9th of August, 1825. But I find that there is a subsequent
instrument hitherto unknown to me, bearing date the 20th of July, 1826,
hardly a year later than the previous one. And there is farther, I
see'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--Mr. Standish was cautiously travelling over the document with his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>)
spectacles--<div class="bookquote">``a codicil to this latter will, bearing date March 1, 1828.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said sister Martha, not meaning to be audible, but driven
to some articulation under this pressure of dates.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall begin by reading the earlier will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Standish,
<div class="bookquote">``since such, as appears by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not having destroyed the document, was
the intention of deceased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div><p/>The preamble was felt to be rather long, and several besides Solomon
shook their heads pathetically, looking on the ground: all eyes avoided
meeting other eyes, and were chiefly fixed either on the spots in the
table-cloth or on Mr. Standish's bald head; excepting Mary Garth's.
When all the rest were trying to look nowhere in particular, it was
safe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) to look at them. And at the sound of the first <div class="bookquote">``give and
bequeath''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could see all complexions changing subtly, as if some
faint vibration were passing through them, save that of Mr. Rigg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>)
sat in unaltered calm, and, in fact, the company, preoccupied with more
important problems, and with the complication of listening to bequests
which might or might not be revoked, had ceased to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>). Fred
blushed, and Mr. Vincy found it impossible to do without his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) snuff-box
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) hand, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) kept it closed.

<p/>The small bequests came first, and even the recollection that there was
another will and that poor Peter might have thought better of it, could
not quell the rising disgust and indignation. One likes to be done
well by in every tense, past, present, and future. And here was Peter
capable five years ago of leaving only two hundred apiece to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own
brothers and sisters, and only a hundred apiece to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own nephews and
nieces: the Garths were not mentioned, but Mrs. Vincy and Rosamond were
each to have a hundred. Mr. Trumbull was to have the gold-headed cane
and fifty pounds; the other second cousins and the cousins present were
each to have the like handsome sum, which, as the saturnine cousin
observed, was a sort of legacy that left a man nowhere; and there was
much more of such offensive dribbling in favor of persons not
present--problematical, and, it was to be feared, low connections.
Altogether, reckoning hastily, here were about three thousand disposed of.
Where then had Peter meant the rest of the money to go--and where the
land? and what was revoked and what not revoked--and was the revocation
for better or for worse? All emotion must be conditional, and might turn
out to be the wrong thing. The men were strong enough to bear up and
keep quiet under this confused suspense; some letting their lower lip
fall, others pursing it up, according to the habit of their muscles.
But Jane and Martha sank under the rush of questions, and began to cry;
poor Mrs. Cranch being half moved with the consolation of getting any
hundreds at all without working for them, and half aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>Cranch</b></font>) share
was scanty; whereas Mrs. Waule's mind was entirely flooded with the
sense of being an own sister and getting little, while somebody else
was to have much. The general expectation now was that the <div class="bookquote">``much''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred Vincy</b></font>)</div>would fall to Fred Vincy, but the Vincys themselves were surprised when
ten thousand pounds in specified investments were declared to be
bequeathed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>):--was the land coming too? Fred bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) lips: it was
difficult to help smiling, and Mrs. Vincy felt herself the happiest of
women--possible revocation shrinking out of sight in this dazzling
vision.

<p/>There was still a residue of personal property as well as the land, but
the whole was left to one person, and that person was--O
possibilities! O expectations founded on the favor of <div class="bookquote">``close''  (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div>old
gentlemen! O endless vocatives that would still leave expression
slipping helpless from the measurement of mortal folly!--that
residuary legatee was Joshua Rigg, who was also sole executor, and who
was to take thenceforth the name of Featherstone.

<p/>There was a rustling which seemed like a shudder running round the
room. Every one stared afresh at Mr. Rigg, who apparently experienced
no surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A most singular testamentary disposition!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Trumbull,
preferring for once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) should be considered ignorant in the past.
<div class="bookquote">``But there is a second will--there is a further document. We have not
yet heard the final wishes of the deceased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary Garth was feeling that what they had yet to hear were not the
final wishes. The second will revoked everything except the legacies
to the low persons before mentioned -LRB-some alterations in these being
the occasion of the codicil-RRB-, and the bequest of all the land lying in
Lowick parish with all the stock and household furniture, to Joshua
Rigg. The residue of the property was to be devoted to the erection
and endowment of almshouses for old men, to be called Featherstone's
Alms-Houses, and to be built on a piece of land near Middlemarch
already bought for the purpose by the testator, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) wishing--so the
document declared--to please God Almighty. Nobody present had a
farthing; but Mr. Trumbull had the gold-headed cane. It took some time
for the company to recover the power of expression. Mary dared not
look at Fred.

<p/>Mr. Vincy was the first to speak--after using his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) snuff-box
energetically--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) spoke with loud indignation. <div class="bookquote">``The most
unaccountable will I ever heard! I should say he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) right
mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made it. I should say this last will was void,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>added Mr.
Vincy, feeling that this expression put the thing in the true light.
<div class="bookquote">``Eh Standish?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our deceased friend always knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was about, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Standish. <div class="bookquote">``Everything is quite regular. Here is a letter from
Clemmens of Brassing tied with the will. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) drew it up. A very
respectable solicitor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never noticed any alienation of mind--any aberration of intellect in
the late Mr. Featherstone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Borthrop Trumbull, <div class="bookquote">``but I call this
will eccentric. I was always willingly of service to the old soul; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) intimated pretty plainly a sense of obligation which would show
itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) will. The gold-headed cane is farcical considered as an
acknowledgment to me; but happily I am above mercenary considerations.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's nothing very surprising in the matter that I can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said
Caleb Garth. <div class="bookquote">``Anybody might have had more reason for wondering if the
will had been what you might expect from an open-minded straightforward
man. For my part, I wish there was no such thing as a will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a strange sentiment to come from a Christian man, by God!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said
the lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know how you will back that up, Garth!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, leaning forward, adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) finger-tips with
nicety and looking meditatively on the ground. It always seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
that words were the hardest part of <div class="bookquote">``business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But here Mr. Jonah Featherstone made himself heard. <div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always
was a fine hypocrite, was my brother Peter. But this will cuts out
everything. If I'd known, a wagon and six horses shouldn't have drawn
me from Brassing. I'll put a white hat and drab coat on to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cranch/Cranch</b></font>)</div>wept Mrs. Cranch, <div class="bookquote">``and we've been at the expense of
travelling, and that poor lad sitting idle here so long! It's the
first time I ever heard my brother Peter was so wishful to please God
Almighty; but if I was to be struck helpless I must say it's hard--I
can think no other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cranch/Cranch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll do him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) no good where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s gone, that's my belief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon,
with a bitterness which was remarkably genuine, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) tone could
not help being sly. <div class="bookquote">``Peter was a bad liver, and almshouses won't cover
it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)'s had the impudence to show it at the last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And all the while had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) own lawful family--brothers and sisters
and nephews and nieces--and has sat in church with 'em whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
thought well to come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule. <div class="bookquote">``And might have left his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
property so respectable, to them that's never been used to extravagance
or unsteadiness in no manner of way--and not so poor but what they
could have saved every penny and made more of it. And me--the trouble
I've been at, times and times, to come here and be sisterly--and him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>)
with things on his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) mind all the while that might make anybody's flesh
creep. But if the Almighty's allowed it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) means to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) for
it. Brother Solomon, I shall be going, if you'll drive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've no desire to put my foot on the premises again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon.
<div class="bookquote">``I've got land of my own and property of my own to will away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a poor tale how luck goes in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Featherstone/Featherstone/Jonah</b></font>)</div>said Jonah. <div class="bookquote">``It never
answers to have a bit of spirit in you. You'd better be a dog in the
manger. But those above ground might learn a lesson. One fool's will
is enough in a family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's more ways than one of being a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``I shan't
leave my money to be poured down the sink, and I shan't leave it to
foundlings from Africay. I like Featherstones that were brewed such,
and not turned Featherstones with sticking the name on 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div><p/>Solomon addressed these remarks in a loud aside to Mrs. Waule as he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)
rose to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Waule</b></font>). Brother Jonah felt himself capable of much more
stinging wit than this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) reflected that there was no use in
offending the new proprietor of Stone Court, until you were certain
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was quite without intentions of hospitality towards witty men
whose name he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was about to bear.

<p/>Mr. Joshua Rigg, in fact, appeared to trouble himself little about any
innuendoes, but showed a notable change of manner, walking coolly up to
Mr. Standish and putting business questions with much coolness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) had
a high chirping voice and a vile accent. Fred, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) no longer moved
to laughter, thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the lowest monster he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had ever seen. But Fred
was feeling rather sick. The Middlemarch mercer waited for an
opportunity of engaging Mr. Rigg in conversation: there was no knowing
how many pairs of legs the new proprietor might require hose for, and
profits were more to be relied on than legacies. Also, the mercer, as
a second cousin, was dispassionate enough to feel curiosity.

<p/>Mr. Vincy, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) one outburst, had remained proudly silent, though
too much preoccupied with unpleasant feelings to think of moving, till
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) wife had gone to Fred's side and was crying
silently while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) darling's hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) rose immediately, and
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) back on the company while he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in an
undertone,--<div class="bookquote">``Don't give way, Lucy; don't make a fool of yourself, my
dear, before these people,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) added in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) usual loud voice--<div class="bookquote">``Go and
order the phaeton, Fred; I have no time to waste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary Garth had before this been getting ready to go home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) met Fred in the hall, and now for the first time had the
courage to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had that withered sort of paleness which
will sometimes come on young faces, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hand was very cold when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
shook it. Mary too was agitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was conscious that fatally,
without will of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had perhaps made a great difference to
Fred's lot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, with affectionate sadness. <div class="bookquote">``Be brave, Fred. I do
believe you are better without the money. What was the good of it to
Mr. Featherstone?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all very fine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``What is a fellow to do?
I must go into the Church now.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) knew that this would vex Mary:
very well; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) what else he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could do.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And I
thought I should be able to pay your father at once and make everything
right. And you have not even a hundred pounds left you. What shall
you do now, Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take another situation, of course, as soon as I can get one. My
father has enough to do to keep the rest, without me. Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Stone Court</b></font>)</div><p/>In a very short time Stone Court was cleared of well-brewed
Featherstones and other long-accustomed visitors. Another stranger had
been brought to settle in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, but in the
case of Mr. Rigg Featherstone there was more discontent with immediate
visible consequences than speculation as to the effect which his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>)
presence might have in the future. No soul was prophetic enough to
have any foreboding as to what might appear on the trial of Joshua Rigg.

<p/>And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low
subject. Historical parallels are remarkably efficient in this way.
The chief objection to them is, that the diligent narrator may lack
space, or -LRB-what is often the same thing-RRB- may not be able to think of
them with any degree of particularity, though he (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) may have a
philosophical confidence that if known they would be illustrative. It
seems an easier and shorter way to dignity, to observe that--since
there never was a true story which could not be told in parables, where
you might put a monkey for a margrave, and vice versa--whatever has
been or is to be narrated by me about low people, may be ennobled by
being considered a parable; so that if any bad habits and ugly
consequences are brought into view, the reader may have the relief of
regarding them as not more than figuratively ungenteel, and may feel
himself virtually in company with persons of some style. Thus while I
tell the truth about loobies, my reader's imagination need not be
entirely excluded from an occupation with lords; and the petty sums
which any bankrupt of high standing would be sorry to retire upon, may
be lifted to the level of high commercial transactions by the
inexpensive addition of proportional ciphers.

<p/>As to any provincial history in which the agents are all of high moral
rank, that must be of a date long posterior to the first Reform Bill,
and Peter Featherstone, you perceive, was dead and buried some months
before Lord Grey came into office.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI.

<p/>''`Tis strange to see the humors of these men,
These great aspiring spirits, that should be wise:
... ...
For being the nature of great spirits to love
To be where they may be most eminent;
They, rating of themselves so farre above
Us in conceit, with whom they do frequent,
Imagine how we wonder and esteeme
All that they do or say; which makes them strive
To make our admiration more extreme,
Which they suppose they cannot, `less they give
Notice of their extreme and highest thoughts.
--DANIEL: Tragedy of Philotas.


<p/>Mr. Vincy went home from the reading of the will with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) point of view
considerably changed in relation to many subjects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was an
open-minded man, but given to indirect modes of expressing himself:
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was disappointed in a market for his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) silk braids, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) swore at
the groom; when his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) brother-in-law Bulstrode had vexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) made
cutting remarks on Methodism; and it was now apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) regarded
Fred's idleness with a sudden increase of severity, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) throwing an
embroidered cap out of the smoking-room on to the hall-floor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) observed, when that young gentleman was moving off to
bed, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you've made up your mind now to go up next term and pass
your examination. I've taken my resolution, so I advise you to lose no
time in taking yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>that gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred made no answer: he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was too utterly depressed. Twenty-four hours
ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had thought that instead of needing to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should do,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should by this time know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) needed to do nothing: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
should hunt in pink, have a first-rate hunter, ride to cover on a fine
hack, and be generally respected for doing so; moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should
be able at once to pay Mr. Garth, and that Mary could no longer have
any reason for not marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>). And all this was to have come without
study or other inconvenience, purely by the favor of providence in the
shape of an old gentleman's caprice. But now, at the end of the
twenty-four hours, all those firm expectations were upset. It was
<div class="bookquote">``rather hard lines''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was smarting under this
disappointment he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should be treated as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could have helped it. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went away silently and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother pleaded for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be hard on the poor boy, Vincy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll turn out well yet, though
that wicked man has deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I feel as sure as I sit here, Fred
will turn out well--else why was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) brought back from the brink of the
grave? And I call it a robbery: it was like giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the land, to
promise it; and what is promising, if making everybody believe is not
promising? And you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ten thousand pounds, and then
took it away again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Took it away again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you the lad's
an unlucky lad, Lucy. And you've always spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Vincy, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was my first, and you made a fine fuss with him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) when
he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) came. You were as proud as proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, easily
recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) cheerful smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows what babies will turn to? I was fool enough, I dare say,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div>said the husband--more mildly, however.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But who has handsomer, better children than ours? Fred is far beyond
other people's sons: you may hear it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) speech, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has kept
college company. And Rosamond--where is there a girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
might stand beside any lady in the land, and only look the better for
it. You see--Mr. Lydgate has kept the highest company and been
everywhere, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) at once. Not but what I could
have wished Rosamond had not engaged herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might have met
somebody on a visit who would have been a far better match; I mean at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) schoolfellow Miss Willoughby's. There are relations in that family
quite as high as Mr. Lydgate's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn relations!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy; <div class="bookquote">``I've had enough of them. I don't
want a son-in-law who has got nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) relations to recommend
him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, <div class="bookquote">``you seemed as pleased as could be
about it. It's true, I wasn't at home; but Rosamond told me you hadn't
a word to say against the engagement. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) has begun to buy in the
best linen and cambric for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) underclothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not by my will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have enough to do this
year, with an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes.
The times are as tight as can be; everybody is being ruined; and I
don't believe Lydgate has got a farthing. I shan't give my consent to
their marrying. Let 'em wait, as their elders have done before 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosamond will take it hard, Vincy, and you know you never could bear
to cross her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I could. The sooner the engagement's off, the better. I don't
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)'ll ever make an income, the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) goes on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) makes
enemies; that's all I hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) making.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stands very high with Mr. Bulstrode, my dear. The marriage
would please _him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)_, I should think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please the deuce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy. <div class="bookquote">``Bulstrode won't pay for their
keep. And if Lydgate thinks I'm going to give money for them to set up
housekeeping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)'s mistaken, that's all. I expect I shall have to put
down my horses soon. You'd better tell Rosy what I say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a not infrequent procedure with Mr. Vincy--to be rash in
jovial assent, and on becoming subsequently conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had been
rash, to employ others in making the offensive retractation. However,
Mrs. Vincy, who never willingly opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) husband, lost no time the
next morning in letting Rosamond know what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had said. Rosamond,
examining some muslin-work, listened in silence, and at the end gave a
certain turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) graceful neck, of which only long experience could
teach you that it meant perfect obstinacy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you say, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mother, with affectionate
deference.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa does not mean anything of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, quite calmly.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) has always said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) wished me to marry the man I loved. And I
shall marry Mr. Lydgate. It is seven weeks now since papa gave his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
consent. And I hope we shall have Mrs. Bretton's house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I shall leave you to manage your papa. You always do
manage everybody. But if we ever do go and get damask, Sadler's is the
place--far better than Hopkins's. Mrs. Bretton's is very large, though:
I should love you to have such a house; but it will take a great deal
of furniture--carpeting and everything, besides plate and glass. And
you hear, your papa says he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will give no money. Do you think Mr.
Lydgate expects it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot imagine that I should ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), mamma. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
understands his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own affairs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) may have been looking for money, my dear, and we all thought of
your having a pretty legacy as well as Fred;--and now everything is so
dreadful--there's no pleasure in thinking of anything, with that poor
boy disappointed as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That has nothing to do with my marriage, mamma. Fred must leave off
being idle. I am going up-stairs to take this work to Miss Morgan: she (<font color='blue'><b>Morgan</b></font>)
does the open hemming very well. Mary Garth might do some work for me
now, I should think. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) sewing is exquisite; it is the nicest thing I
know about Mary. I should so like to have all my cambric frilling
double-hemmed. And it takes a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Vincy's belief that Rosamond could manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) papa was well
founded. Apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) dinners and his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) coursing, Mr. Vincy,
blustering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was, had as little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) own way as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had been a
prime minister: the force of circumstances was easily too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>),
as it is for most pleasure-loving florid men; and the circumstance
called Rosamond was particularly forcible by means of that mild
persistence which, as we know, enables a white soft living substance to
make its way in spite of opposing rock. Papa was not a rock: he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had no
other fixity than that fixity of alternating impulses sometimes called
habit, and this was altogether unfavorable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) taking the only
decisive line of conduct in relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) daughter's
engagement--namely, to inquire thoroughly into Lydgate's circumstances,
declare his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own inability to furnish money, and forbid alike either a
speedy marriage or an engagement which must be too lengthy. That seems
very simple and easy in the statement; but a disagreeable resolve
formed in the chill hours of the morning had as many conditions against
it as the early frost, and rarely persisted under the warming
influences of the day. The indirect though emphatic expression of
opinion to which Mr. Vincy was prone suffered much restraint in this
case: Lydgate was a proud man towards whom innuendoes were obviously
unsafe, and throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat on the floor was out of the question. Mr.
Vincy was a little in awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), a little vain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) wanted to marry
Rosamond, a little indisposed to raise a question of money in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
own position was not advantageous, a little afraid of being worsted in
dialogue with a man better educated and more highly bred than himself,
and a little afraid of doing what his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter would not like. The
part Mr. Vincy preferred playing was that of the generous host whom
nobody criticises. In the earlier half of the day there was business
to hinder any formal communication of an adverse resolve; in the later
there was dinner, wine, whist, and general satisfaction. And in the
mean while the hours were each leaving their little deposit and
gradually forming the final reason for inaction, namely, that action
was too late. The accepted lover spent most of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) evenings in Lowick
Gate, and a love-making not at all dependent on money-advances from
fathers-in-law, or prospective income from a profession, went on
flourishingly under Mr. Vincy's own eyes. Young love-making--that
gossamer web! Even the points it clings to--the things whence its
subtle interlacings are swung--are scarcely perceptible: momentary
touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from blue and dark orbs,
unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and lip, faintest
tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs and indefinable
joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of completeness,
indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
inward self with wonderful rapidity, in spite of experience supposed to
be finished off with the drama of Laure--in spite too of medicine and
biology; for the inspection of macerated muscle or of eyes presented in
a dish -LRB-like Santa Lucia's-RRB-, and other incidents of scientific inquiry,
are observed to be less incompatible with poetic love than a native
dulness or a lively addiction to the lowest prose. As for Rosamond,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in the water-lily's expanding wonderment at its own fuller
life, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) too was spinning industriously at the mutual web. All
this went on in the corner of the drawing-room where the piano stood,
and subtle as it was, the light made it a sort of rainbow visible to
many observers besides Mr. Farebrother. The certainty that Miss Vincy
and Mr. Lydgate were engaged became general in Middlemarch without the
aid of formal announcement.

<p/>Aunt Bulstrode was again stirred to anxiety; but this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>)
addressed herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) brother, going to the warehouse expressly to
avoid Mrs. Vincy's volatility. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replies were not satisfactory.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walter, you never mean to tell me that you have allowed all this to go
on without inquiry into Mr. Lydgate's prospects?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode,
opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes with wider gravity at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother, who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
peevish warehouse humor. <div class="bookquote">``Think of this girl brought up in luxury--in
too worldly a way, I am sorry to say--what will she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) do on a small
income?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, confound it, Harriet! What can I do when men come into the town
without any asking of mine? Did you shut your house up against
Lydgate? Bulstrode has pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) forward more than anybody. I never
made any fuss about the young fellow. You should go and talk to your
husband about it, not me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, really, Walter, how can Mr. Bulstrode be to blame? I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
did not wish for the engagement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if Bulstrode had not taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) by the hand, I should never have
invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you called him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in to attend on Fred, and I am sure that was a
mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) clew in the intricacies of the
subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know about mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, testily. <div class="bookquote">``I know I am
worried more than I like with my family. I was a good brother to you,
Harriet, before you married Bulstrode, and I must say he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) doesn't always
show that friendly spirit towards your family that might have been
expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Vincy was very little like a Jesuit, but no
accomplished Jesuit could have turned a question more adroitly.
Harriet had to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) husband instead of blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother, and
the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some
recent sparring between the brothers-in-law at a vestry meeting.

<p/>Mrs. Bulstrode did not repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brother's complaints to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband,
but in the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) of Lydgate and Rosamond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did
not share her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) warm interest, however; and only spoke with resignation
of the risks attendant on the beginning of medical practice and the
desirability of prudence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure we are bound to pray for that thoughtless girl--brought up
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, wishing to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's
feelings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, assentingly. <div class="bookquote">``Those who are not
of this world can do little else to arrest the errors of the
obstinately worldly. That is what we must accustom ourselves to
recognize with regard to your brother's family. I could have wished
that Mr. Lydgate had not entered into such a union; but my relations
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) are limited to that use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gifts for God's purposes which
is taught us by the divine government under each dispensation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bulstrode said no more, attributing some dissatisfaction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
felt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own want of spirituality. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband
was one of those men whose memoirs should be written when they died.

<p/>As to Lydgate himself, having been accepted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was prepared to accept
all the consequences which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) believed himself to foresee with perfect
clearness. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must be married in a year--perhaps even in
half a year. This was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had intended; but other schemes
would not be hindered: they would simply adjust themselves anew.
Marriage, of course, must be prepared for in the usual way. A house
must be taken instead of the rooms he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at present occupied; and Lydgate,
having heard Rosamond speak with admiration of old Mrs. Bretton's house
-LRB-situated in Lowick Gate-RRB-, took notice when it fell vacant after the
old lady's death, and immediately entered into treaty for it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did this in an episodic way, very much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gave orders to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
tailor for every requisite of perfect dress, without any notion of
being extravagant. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have despised any
ostentation of expense; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession had familiarized him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with all
grades of poverty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cared much for those who suffered hardships.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have behaved perfectly at a table where the sauce was served
in a jug with the handle off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have remembered nothing
about a grand dinner except that a man was there who talked well. But
it had never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should live in any other than what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have called an ordinary way, with green glasses for hock, and
excellent waiting at table. In warming himself at French social
theories he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brought away no smell of scorching. We may handle even
extreme opinions with impunity while our furniture, our dinner-giving,
and preference for armorial bearings in our own case, link us
indissolubly with the established order. And Lydgate's tendency was
not towards extreme opinions: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have liked no barefooted
doctrines, being particular about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) boots: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was no radical in
relation to anything but medical reform and the prosecution of
discovery. In the rest of practical life he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked by hereditary
habit; half from that personal pride and unreflecting egoism which I
have already called commonness, and half from that naivete which
belonged to preoccupation with favorite ideas.

<p/>Any inward debate Lydgate had as to the consequences of this engagement
which had stolen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), turned on the paucity of time rather than of
money. Certainly, being in love and being expected continually by some
one who always turned out to be prettier than memory could represent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to be, did interfere with the diligent use of spare hours which
might serve some <div class="bookquote">``plodding fellow of a German''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>to make the great,
imminent discovery. This was really an argument for not deferring the
marriage too long, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) implied to Mr. Farebrother, one day that the
Vicar came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) room with some pond-products which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wanted to
examine under a better microscope than his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) own, and, finding Lydgate's
tableful of apparatus and specimens in confusion, said sarcastically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eros has degenerated; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) began by introducing order and harmony, and
now he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) brings back chaos.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, at some stages,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brows and smiling,
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) microscope. <div class="bookquote">``But a better order will
begin after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so, really. This unsettled state of affairs uses up the time,
and when one has notions in science, every moment is an opportunity. I
feel sure that marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to
work steadily. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has everything at home then--no teasing with
personal speculations--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can get calmness and freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are an enviable dog,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``to have such a
prospect--Rosamond, calmness and freedom, all to your share. Here am
I with nothing but my pipe and pond-animalcules. Now, are you ready?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate did not mention to the Vicar another reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had for wishing
to shorten the period of courtship. It was rather irritating to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
even with the wine of love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) veins, to be obliged to mingle so
often with the family party at the Vincys', and to enter so much into
Middlemarch gossip, protracted good cheer, whist-playing, and general
futility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had to be deferential when Mr. Vincy decided questions
with trenchant ignorance, especially as to those liquors which were the
best inward pickle, preserving you from the effects of bad air. Mrs.
Vincy's openness and simplicity were quite unstreaked with suspicion as
to the subtle offence she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) might give to the taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) intended
son-in-law; and altogether Lydgate had to confess to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was descending a little in relation to Rosamond's family. But that
exquisite creature herself suffered in the same sort of way:--it was
at least one delightful thought that in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
a much-needed transplantation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) one evening, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gentlest tone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sat
down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and looked closely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face--

<p/>But I must first say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) alone in the drawing-room,
where the great old-fashioned window, almost as large as the side of
the room, was opened to the summer scents of the garden at the back of
the house. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father and mother were gone to a party, and the rest
were all out with the butterflies.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear! your eyelids are red.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder why.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) nature
to pour forth wishes or grievances. They only came forth gracefully on
solicitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As if you could hide it from me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hand
tenderly on both of hers. <div class="bookquote">``Don't I see a tiny drop on one of the
lashes? Things trouble you, and you don't tell me. That is unloving.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I tell you what you cannot alter? They are every-day
things:--perhaps they have been a little worse lately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Family annoyances. Don't fear speaking. I guess them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Papa has been more irritable lately. Fred makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) angry, and this
morning there was a fresh quarrel because Fred threatens to throw his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
whole education away, and do something quite beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). And
besides--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond hesitated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cheeks were gathering a slight flush.
Lydgate had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in trouble since the morning of their
engagement, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never felt so passionately towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as at
this moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) kissed the hesitating lips gently, as if to encourage
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel that papa is not quite pleased about our engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Rosamond
continued, almost in a whisper; <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said last night that he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) should
certainly speak to you and say it must be given up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you give it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with quick energy--almost angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never give up anything that I choose to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) calmness at the touching of this chord.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) again. This constancy of
purpose in the right place was adorable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went on:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is too late now for your father to say that our engagement must be
given up. You are of age, and I claim you as mine. If anything is
done to make you unhappy,--that is a reason for hastening our marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>An unmistakable delight shone forth from the blue eyes that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
and the radiance seemed to light up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) future with mild sunshine.
Ideal happiness -LRB-of the kind known in the Arabian Nights, in which you
are invited to step from the labor and discord of the street into a
paradise where everything is given to you and nothing claimed-RRB- seemed
to be an affair of a few weeks' waiting, more or less.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should we defer it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, with ardent insistence. <div class="bookquote">``I have
taken the house now: everything else can soon be got ready--can it
not? You will not mind about new clothes. Those can be bought
afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What original notions you clever men have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, dimpling
with more thorough laughter than usual at this humorous incongruity.
<div class="bookquote">``This is the first time I ever heard of wedding-clothes being bought
after marriage.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you don't mean to say you would insist on my waiting months for
the sake of clothes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, half thinking that Rosamond was
tormenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) prettily, and half fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) really shrank from
speedy marriage. <div class="bookquote">``Remember, we are looking forward to a better sort of
happiness even than this--being continually together, independent of
others, and ordering our lives as we will. Come, dear, tell me how
soon you can be altogether mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a serious pleading in Lydgate's tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
would be injuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) by any fantastic delays. Rosamond became serious
too, and slightly meditative; in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was going through many
intricacies of lace-edging and hosiery and petticoat-tucking, in order
to give an answer that would at least be approximative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Six weeks would be ample--say so, Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>insisted Lydgate,
releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm gently round her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/>One little hand immediately went to pat her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hair, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
neck a meditative turn, and then said seriously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There would be the house-linen and the furniture to be prepared.
Still, mamma could see to those while we were away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure. We must be away a week or so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, more than that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, earnestly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was thinking of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) evening dresses for the visit to Sir Godwin Lydgate's, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had long been secretly hoping for as a delightful employment of at
least one quarter of the honeymoon, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) deferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
introduction to the uncle who was a doctor of divinity -LRB-also a pleasing
though sober kind of rank, when sustained by blood-RRB-. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
lover with some wondering remonstrance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) readily
understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might wish to lengthen the sweet time of double
solitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whatever you wish, my darling, when the day is fixed. But let us take
a decided course, and put an end to any discomfort you may be
suffering. Six weeks!--I am sure they would be ample.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could certainly hasten the work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``Will you, then,
mention it to papa?--I think it would be better to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
blushed and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) as the garden flowers look at us when we walk
forth happily among them in the transcendent evening light: is there
not a soul beyond utterance, half nymph, half child, in those delicate
petals which glow and breathe about the centres of deep color?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) ear and a little bit of neck under it with his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lips, and
they sat quite still for many minutes which flowed by them like a small
gurgling brook with the kisses of the sun upon it. Rosamond thought
that no one could be more in love than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was; and Lydgate thought
that after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wild mistakes and absurd credulity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had found
perfect womanhood--felt as if already breathed upon by exquisite wedded
affection such as would be bestowed by an accomplished creature who
venerated his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) high musings and momentous labors and would never
interfere with them; who would create order in the home and accounts
with still magic, yet keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fingers ready to touch the lute and
transform life into romance at any moment; who was instructed to the
true womanly limit and not a hair's-breadth beyond--docile, therefore,
and ready to carry out behests which came from that limit. It was
plainer now than ever that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) notion of remaining much longer a
bachelor had been a mistake: marriage would not be an obstruction but a
furtherance. And happening the next day to accompany a patient to
Brassing, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) saw a dinner-service there which struck him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) as so exactly
the right thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) bought it at once. It saved time to do these
things just when you thought of them, and Lydgate hated ugly crockery.
The dinner-service in question was expensive, but that might be in the
nature of dinner-services. Furnishing was necessarily expensive; but
then it had to be done only once.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be lovely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, when Lydgate mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
purchase with some descriptive touches. <div class="bookquote">``Just what Rosy ought to have.
I trust in heaven it won't be broken!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One must hire servants who will not break things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.
-LRB-Certainly, this was reasoning with an imperfect vision of sequences.
But at that period there was no sort of reasoning which was not more or
less sanctioned by men of science.-RRB-

<p/>Of course it was unnecessary to defer the mention of anything to mamma,
who did not readily take views that were not cheerful, and being a
happy wife herself, had hardly any feeling but pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter's
marriage. But Rosamond had good reasons for suggesting to Lydgate that
papa should be appealed to in writing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) prepared for the arrival of
the letter by walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) papa to the warehouse the next morning,
and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) on the way that Mr. Lydgate wished to be married soon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy. <div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) got to marry on?
You'd much better give up the engagement. I've told you so pretty
plainly before this. What have you had such an education for, if you
are to go and marry a poor man? It's a cruel thing for a father to
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate is not poor, papa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bought Mr. Peacock's practice,
which, they say, is worth eight or nine hundred a-year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stuff and nonsense! What's buying a practice? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might as well buy
next year's swallows. It'll all slip through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fingers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) will increase the practice. See how he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has
been called in by the Chettams and Casaubons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) knows I shan't give anything--with this disappointment about
Fred, and Parliament going to be dissolved, and machine-breaking
everywhere, and an election coming on--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear papa! what can that have to do with my marriage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A pretty deal to do with it! We may all be ruined for what I know--the
country's in that state! Some say it's the end of the world, and
be hanged if I don't think it looks like it! Anyhow, it's not a time
for me to be drawing money out of my business, and I should wish
Lydgate to know that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) expects nothing, papa. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has such very high
connections: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is sure to rise in one way or another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is engaged
in making scientific discoveries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vincy was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot give up my only prospect of happiness, papa. Mr. Lydgate is a
gentleman. I could never love any one who was not a perfect gentleman.
You would not like me to go into a consumption, as Arabella Hawley did.
And you know that I never change my mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div><p/>Again papa was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Promise me, papa, that you will consent to what we wish. We shall
never give each other up; and you know that you have always objected to
long courtships and late marriages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a little more urgency of this kind, till Mr. Vincy said,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, well, child, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) must write to me first before I can answer
him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>),'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>--and Rosamond was certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) point.

<p/>Mr. Vincy's answer consisted chiefly in a demand that Lydgate should
insure his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life--a demand immediately conceded. This was a
delightfully reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, but in the
mean time not a self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make
everything comfortable about Rosamond's marriage; and the necessary
purchases went on with much spirit. Not without prudential
considerations, however. A bride -LRB-who is going to visit at a
baronet's-RRB- must have a few first-rate pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond
the absolutely necessary half-dozen, Rosamond contented herself without
the very highest style of embroidery and Valenciennes. Lydgate also,
finding that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sum of eight hundred pounds had been considerably
reduced since he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had come to Middlemarch, restrained his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) inclination
for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went
into Kibble's establishment at Brassing to buy forks and spoons. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was too proud to act as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) presupposed that Mr. Vincy would advance
money to provide furniture; and though, since it would not be
necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills would be left
standing over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) did not waste time in conjecturing how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment easy.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was not going to do anything extravagant, but the requisite things
must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a poor
quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that
science and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession were the objects he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should alone pursue
enthusiastically; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not imagine himself pursuing them in
such a home as Wrench had--the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the
children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones,
black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched
lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen domestic apparatus.

<p/>Rosamond, however, was on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) side much occupied with conjectures,
though her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) quick imitative perception warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) against betraying them
too crudely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall like so much to know your family,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said one day, when the
wedding journey was being discussed. <div class="bookquote">``We might perhaps take a
direction that would allow us to see them as we returned. Which of
your uncles do you like best?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,--my uncle Godwin, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) is a good-natured old fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You were constantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) house at Quallingham, when you were a boy,
were you not? I should so like to see the old spot and everything you
were used to. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) know you are going to be married?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, carelessly, turning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hair up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do send him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) word of it, you naughty undutiful nephew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) will perhaps
ask you to take me to Quallingham; and then you could show me about the
grounds, and I could imagine you there when you were a boy. Remember,
you see me in my home, just as it has been since I was a child. It is
not fair that I should be so ignorant of yours. But perhaps you would
be a little ashamed of me. I forgot that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tenderly, and really accepted the suggestion that
the proud pleasure of showing so charming a bride was worth some
trouble. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came to think of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would like to see the old
spots with Rosamond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will write to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), then. But my cousins are bores.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>It seemed magnificent to Rosamond to be able to speak so slightingly of
a baronet's family, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt much contentment in the prospect of
being able to estimate them contemptuously on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own account.

<p/>But mamma was near spoiling all, a day or two later, by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope your uncle Sir Godwin will not look down on Rosy, Mr. Lydgate.
I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would do something handsome. A thousand or two can
be nothing to a baronet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, blushing deeply; and Lydgate pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) so much
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) remained silent and went to the other end of the room to
examine a print curiously, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been absent-minded. Mamma had a
little filial lecture afterwards, and was docile as usual. But
Rosamond reflected that if any of those high-bred cousins who were
bores, should be induced to visit Middlemarch, they would see many
things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own family which might shock them. Hence it seemed
desirable that Lydgate should by-and-by get some first-rate position
elsewhere than in Middlemarch; and this could hardly be difficult in
the case of a man who had a titled uncle and could make discoveries.
Lydgate, you perceive, had talked fervidly to Rosamond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hopes as
to the highest uses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life, and had found it delightful to be
listened to by a creature who would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the sweet furtherance of
satisfying affection--beauty--repose--such help as our thoughts get
from the summer sky and the flower-fringed meadows.

<p/>Lydgate relied much on the psychological difference between what for
the sake of variety I will call goose and gander: especially on the
innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the
strength of the gander.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thrice happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) that is so well assured
Unto herself and settled so in heart
That neither will for better be allured
Ne fears to worse with any chance to start,
But like a steddy ship doth strongly part
The raging waves and keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) course aright;
Ne aught for tempest doth from it depart,
Ne aught for fairer weather's false delight.
Such self-assurance need not fear the spight
Of grudging foes; ne favour seek of friends;
But in the stay of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) own stedfast might
Neither to one herself nor other bends.
Most happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) that most assured doth rest,
But he (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>) most happy who such one loves best.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SPENSER.


<p/>The doubt hinted by Mr. Vincy whether it were only the general election
or the end of the world that was coming on, now that George the Fourth
was dead, Parliament dissolved, Wellington and Peel generally
depreciated and the new King apologetic, was a feeble type of the
uncertainties in provincial opinion at that time. With the glow-worm
lights of country places, how could men see which were their own
thoughts in the confusion of a Tory Ministry passing Liberal measures,
of Tory nobles and electors being anxious to return Liberals rather
than friends of the recreant Ministers, and of outcries for remedies
which seemed to have a mysteriously remote bearing on private interest,
and were made suspicious by the advocacy of disagreeable neighbors?
Buyers of the Middlemarch newspapers found themselves in an anomalous
position: during the agitation on the Catholic Question many had given
up the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer'' (<font color='red'><b>Catholic</b></font>)</div>--which had a motto from Charles James Fox and was in
the van of progress--because it had taken Peel's side about the
Papists, and had thus blotted its Liberalism with a toleration of
Jesuitry and Baal; but they were ill-satisfied with the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Baal</b></font>)</div>which--since its blasts against Rome, and in the general flaccidity of
the public mind -LRB-nobody knowing who would support whom-RRB---had become
feeble in its blowing.

<p/>It was a time, according to a noticeable article in the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>when
the crying needs of the country might well counteract a reluctance to
public action on the part of men whose minds had from long experience
acquired breadth as well as concentration, decision of judgment as well
as tolerance, dispassionateness as well as energy--in fact, all those
qualities which in the melancholy experience of mankind have been the
least disposed to share lodgings.

<p/>Mr. Hackbutt, whose fluent speech was at that time floating more widely
than usual, and leaving much uncertainty as to its ultimate channel,
was heard to say in Mr. Hawley's office that the article in question
<div class="bookquote">``emanated''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>from Brooke of Tipton, and that Brooke had secretly bought
the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>some months ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means mischief, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>)'s got the freak of
being a popular man now, after dangling about like a stray tortoise.
So much the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>). I've had my eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>) for some time. He (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>)
shall be prettily pumped upon. He (<font color='blue'><b>foes</b></font>)'s a damned bad landlord. What
business has an old county man to come currying favor with a low set of
dark-blue freemen? As to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paper, I only hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may do the writing
himself. It would be worth our paying for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has got a very brilliant young fellow to edit it, who
can write the highest style of leading article, quite equal to anything
in the London papers. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means to take very high ground on Reform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Brooke reform his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rent-roll. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a cursed old screw, and the

fellow is some loose fish from London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name is Ladislaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is said to be of foreign extraction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley; <div class="bookquote">``some emissary. He (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>)'ll begin with
flourishing about the Rights of Man and end with murdering a wench.
That's the style.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must concede that there are abuses, Hawley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hackbutt/Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hackbutt,
foreseeing some political disagreement with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) family lawyer. <div class="bookquote">``I
myself should never favor immoderate views--in fact I take my stand
with Huskisson--but I cannot blind myself to the consideration that the
non-representation of large towns--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Large towns be damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, impatient of exposition. <div class="bookquote">``I
know a little too much about Middlemarch elections. Let 'em quash
every pocket borough to-morrow, and bring in every mushroom town in the
kingdom--they'll only increase the expense of getting into Parliament.
I go upon facts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Hawley's disgust at the notion of the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>being edited by an
emissary, and of Brooke becoming actively political--as if a tortoise
of desultory pursuits should protrude its small head ambitiously and
become rampant--was hardly equal to the annoyance felt by some members
of Mr. Brooke's own family. The result had oozed forth gradually, like
the discovery that your neighbor has set up an unpleasant kind of
manufacture which will be permanently under your nostrils without legal
remedy. The <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>had been secretly bought even before Will
Ladislaw's arrival, the expected opportunity having offered itself in
the readiness of the proprietor to part with a valuable property which
did not pay; and in the interval since Mr. Brooke had written his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
invitation, those germinal ideas of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind tell upon the world
at large which had been present in him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) younger years, but had
hitherto lain in some obstruction, had been sprouting under cover.

<p/>The development was much furthered by a delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) guest which
proved greater even than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had anticipated. For it seemed that Will
was not only at home in all those artistic and literary subjects which
Mr. Brooke had gone into at one time, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was strikingly ready
at seizing the points of the political situation, and dealing with them
in that large spirit which, aided by adequate memory, lends itself to
quotation and general effectiveness of treatment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) seems to me a kind of Shelley, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke took an
opportunity of saying, for the gratification of Mr. Casaubon. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
mean as to anything objectionable--laxities or atheism, or anything of
that kind, you know--Ladislaw's sentiments in every way I am sure are
good--indeed, we were talking a great deal together last night. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
has the same sort of enthusiasm for liberty, freedom, emancipation--a
fine thing under guidance--under guidance, you know. I think I shall
be able to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) on the right tack; and I am the more pleased because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is a relation of yours, Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>If the right tack implied anything more precise than the rest of Mr.
Brooke's speech, Mr. Casaubon silently hoped that it referred to some
occupation at a great distance from Lowick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had disliked Will while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had begun to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) still more now that Will
had declined his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) help. That is the way with us when we have any uneasy
jealousy in our disposition: if our talents are chiefly of the
burrowing kind, our honey-sipping cousin -LRB-whom we have grave reasons
for objecting to-RRB- is likely to have a secret contempt for us, and any
one who admires him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) passes an oblique criticism on ourselves. Having
the scruples of rectitude in our souls, we are above the meanness of
injuring him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)--rather we meet all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) claims on us by active benefits;
and the drawing of cheques for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), being a superiority which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) must
recognize, gives our bitterness a milder infusion. Now Mr. Casaubon
had been deprived of that superiority -LRB-as anything more than a
remembrance-RRB- in a sudden, capricious manner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) antipathy to Will did
not spring from the common jealousy of a winter-worn husband: it was
something deeper, bred by his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) lifelong claims and discontents; but
Dorothea, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was present--Dorothea, as a young wife who
herself had shown an offensive capability of criticism, necessarily
gave concentration to the uneasiness which had before been vague.

<p/>Will Ladislaw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) side felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) dislike was flourishing at the
expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) gratitude, and spent much inward discourse in justifying
the dislike. Casaubon hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) knew that very well; on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) first
entrance he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could discern a bitterness in the mouth and a venom in the
glance which would almost justify declaring war in spite of past
benefits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was much obliged to Casaubon in the past, but really the
act of marrying this wife was a set-off against the obligation. It was
a question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one's
self ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against
another. And Casaubon had done a wrong to Dorothea in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). A
man was bound to know himself better than that, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) chose to grow
gray crunching bones in a cavern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had no business to be luring a
girl into his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) companionship. <div class="bookquote">``It is the most horrible of
virgin-sacrifices,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Will; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) painted to himself what were
Dorothea's inward sorrows as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been writing a choric wail. But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would never lose sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) gave
up everything else in life he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had one slave in the world, Will had--to use Sir Thomas
Browne's phrase--a <div class="bookquote">``passionate prodigality''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas Browne/THOMAS BROWNE</b></font>)</div>of statement both to
himself and others. The simple truth was that nothing then invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
so strongly as the presence of Dorothea.

<p/>Invitations of the formal kind had been wanting, however, for Will had
never been asked to go to Lowick. Mr. Brooke, indeed, confident of
doing everything agreeable which Casaubon, poor fellow, was too much
absorbed to think of, had arranged to bring Ladislaw to Lowick several
times -LRB-not neglecting meanwhile to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) elsewhere on every
opportunity as <div class="bookquote">``a young relative of Casaubon's'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-RRB-. And though Will had
not seen Dorothea alone, their interviews had been enough to restore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) former sense of young companionship with one who was cleverer than
herself, yet seemed ready to be swayed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Poor Dorothea before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage had never found much room in other minds for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
cared most to say; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not, as we know, enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
superior instruction so much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had expected. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke with
any keenness of interest to Mr. Casaubon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with an air of
patience as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had given a quotation from the Delectus familiar to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) tender years, and sometimes mentioned curtly what ancient
sects or personages had held similar ideas, as if there were too much
of that sort in stock already; at other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was mistaken, and reassert what her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) remark had questioned.

<p/>But Will Ladislaw always seemed to see more in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
herself saw. Dorothea had little vanity, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had the ardent
woman's need to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul.
Hence the mere chance of seeing Will occasionally was like a lunette
opened in the wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) prison, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) a glimpse of the sunny
air; and this pleasure began to nullify her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) original alarm at what her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband might think about the introduction of Will as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's
guest. On this subject Mr. Casaubon had remained dumb.

<p/>But Will wanted to talk with Dorothea alone, and was impatient of slow
circumstance. However slight the terrestrial intercourse between Dante
and Beatrice or Petrarch and Laura, time changes the proportion of
things, and in later days it is preferable to have fewer sonnets and
more conversation. Necessity excused stratagem, but stratagem was
limited by the dread of offending Dorothea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) found out at last that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) wanted to take a particular sketch at Lowick; and one morning when
Mr. Brooke had to drive along the Lowick road on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) way to the county
town, Will asked to be set down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) sketch-book and camp-stool at
Lowick, and without announcing himself at the Manor settled himself to
sketch in a position where he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) must see Dorothea if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came out to
walk--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usually walked an hour in the morning.

<p/>But the stratagem was defeated by the weather. Clouds gathered with
treacherous quickness, the rain came down, and Will was obliged to take
shelter in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) intended, on the strength of relationship, to
go into the drawing-room and wait there without being announced; and
seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) old acquaintance the butler in the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Don't
mention that I am here, Pratt; I will wait till luncheon; I know Mr.
Casaubon does not like to be disturbed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is in the library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Master is out, sir; there's only Mrs. Casaubon in the library. I'd
better tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) you're here, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pratt</b></font>)</div>said Pratt, a red-cheeked man given
to lively converse with Tantripp, and often agreeing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that it
must be dull for Madam.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, very well; this confounded rain has hindered me from sketching,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, feeling so happy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) affected indifference with
delightful ease.

<p/>In another minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was in the library, and Dorothea was meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sweet unconstrained smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon has gone to the Archdeacon's,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, at once. <div class="bookquote">``I
don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will be at home again long before dinner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was
uncertain how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should be. Did you want to say anything
particular to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I came to sketch, but the rain drove me in. Else I would not have
disturbed you yet. I supposed that Mr. Casaubon was here, and I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dislikes interruption at this hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am indebted to the rain, then. I am so glad to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea
uttered these common words with the simple sincerity of an unhappy
child, visited at school.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really came for the chance of seeing you alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will,
mysteriously forced to be just as simple as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could not stay
to ask himself, why not? <div class="bookquote">``I wanted to talk about things, as we did in
Rome. It always makes a difference when other people are present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clear full tone of assent. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seated herself on a dark ottoman with the brown books behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) plain dress of some thin woollen-white material, without
a single ornament on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) besides her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wedding-ring, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were under
a vow to be different from all other women; and Will sat down opposite
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at two yards' distance, the light falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) bright curls and
delicate but rather petulant profile, with its defiant curves of lip
and chin. Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers
which had opened then and there. Dorothea for the moment forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's mysterious irritation against Will: it seemed fresh water at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thirsty lips to speak without fear to the one person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
found receptive; for in looking backward through sadness she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
exaggerated a past solace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have often thought that I should like to talk to you again,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
said, immediately. <div class="bookquote">``It seems strange to me how many things I said to
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember them all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, with the unspeakable content in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
soul of feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was in the presence of a creature worthy to be
perfectly loved. I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own feelings at that moment were perfect,
for we mortals have our divine moments, when love is satisfied in the
completeness of the beloved object.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have tried to learn a great deal since we were in Rome,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I can read Latin a little, and I am beginning to understand
just a little Greek. I can help Mr. Casaubon better now. I can find
out references for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and save his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyes in many ways. But it is very
difficult to be learned; it seems as if people were worn out on the way
to great thoughts, and can never enjoy them because they are too tired.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If a man has a capacity for great thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is likely to overtake
them before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is decrepit,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, with irrepressible quickness.
But through certain sensibilities Dorothea was as quick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face change, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) added, immediately, <div class="bookquote">``But it is quite true
that the best minds have been sometimes overstrained in working out
their ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You correct me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I expressed myself ill. I should
have said that those who have great thoughts get too much worn in
working them out. I used to feel about that, even when I was a little
girl; and it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of
my life would be to help some one who did great works, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
burthen might be lighter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was led on to this bit of autobiography without any sense of
making a revelation. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never before said anything to Will
which threw so strong a light on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) did not shrug his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
shoulders; and for want of that muscular outlet he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) thought the more
irritably of beautiful lips kissing holy skulls and other emptinesses
ecclesiastically enshrined. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had to take care that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) speech
should not betray that thought.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you may easily carry the help too far,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and get
over-wrought yourself. Are you not too much shut up? You already look
paler. It would be better for Mr. Casaubon to have a secretary; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
could easily get a man who would do half his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). It would
save him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) more effectually, and you need only help him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in lighter ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you think of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a tone of earnest
remonstrance. <div class="bookquote">``I should have no happiness if I did not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
work. What could I do? There is no good to be done in Lowick. The
only thing I desire is to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) more. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) objects to a
secretary: please not to mention that again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not, now I know your feeling. But I have heard both Mr.
Brooke and Sir James Chettam express the same wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``but they don't understand--they want me to be a
great deal on horseback, and have the garden altered and new
conservatories, to fill up my days. I thought you could understand
that one's mind has other wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, rather
impatiently--<div class="bookquote">``besides, Mr. Casaubon cannot bear to hear of a secretary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mistake is excusable,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``In old days I used to hear Mr.
Casaubon speak as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looked forward to having a secretary. Indeed
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) held out the prospect of that office to me. But I turned out to
be--not good enough for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was trying to extract out of this an excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
evident repulsion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, with a playful smile, <div class="bookquote">``You were not a
steady worker enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head backward somewhat after the manner of
a spirited horse. And then, the old irritable demon prompting him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) to
give another good pinch at the moth-wings of poor Mr. Casaubon's glory,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``And I have seen since that Mr. Casaubon does not like any
one to overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) work and know thoroughly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is
too doubtful--too uncertain of himself. I may not be good for much,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dislikes me because I disagree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was not without his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) intentions to be always generous, but our
tongues are little triggers which have usually been pulled before
general intentions can be brought to bear. And it was too intolerable
that Casaubon's dislike of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should not be fairly accounted for to
Dorothea. Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had spoken he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was rather uneasy as to the effect
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>But Dorothea was strangely quiet--not immediately indignant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
been on a like occasion in Rome. And the cause lay deep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was no
longer struggling against the perception of facts, but adjusting
herself to their clearest perception; and now when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked steadily
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's failure, still more at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) possible consciousness of
failure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seemed to be looking along the one track where duty became
tenderness. Will's want of reticence might have been met with more
severity, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not already been recommended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mercy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's dislike, which must seem hard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw better
reason for it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not answer at once, but after looking down ruminatingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
said, with some earnestness, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon must have overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
dislike of you so far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) actions were concerned: and that is
admirable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has shown a sense of justice in family matters. It was an
abominable thing that my grandmother should have been disinherited
because she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) made what they called a mesalliance, though there was
nothing to be said against her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) husband except that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a Polish
refugee who gave lessons for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I knew all about her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) bore
the change from wealth to poverty: I wonder whether she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was happy with
her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) husband! Do you know much about them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; only that my grandfather was a patriot--a bright fellow--could
speak many languages--musical--got his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) bread by teaching all sorts of
things. They both died rather early. And I never knew much of my
father, beyond what my mother told me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inherited the musical
talents. I remember his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) slow walk and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long thin hands; and one day
remains with me when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was lying ill, and I was very hungry, and had
only a little bit of bread.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what a different life from mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with keen
interest, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lap. <div class="bookquote">``I have always had too much
of everything. But tell me how it was--Mr. Casaubon could not have
known about you then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; but my father had made himself known to Mr. Casaubon, and that was
my last hungry day. My father died soon after, and my mother and I
were well taken care of. Mr. Casaubon always expressly recognized it
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) duty to take care of us because of the harsh injustice which had
been shown to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mother's sister. But now I am telling you what is
not new to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) inmost soul Will was conscious of wishing to tell Dorothea what
was rather new even in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own construction of things--namely, that
Mr. Casaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Will was
much too good a fellow to be easy under the sense of being ungrateful.
And when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways
of escaping from its bonds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>answered Dorothea; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon has always avoided dwelling on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own honorable actions.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
conduct was depreciated; but this notion of what justice had required
in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) relations with Will Ladislaw took strong hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind.
After a moment's pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had never told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
supported your mother. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still living?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died by an accident--a fall--four years ago. It is curious
that my mother, too, ran away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family, but not for the sake of
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never would tell me anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family, except
that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forsook them to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own living--went on the stage, in
fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a dark-eyed creature, with crisp ringlets, and never
seemed to be getting old. You see I come of rebellious blood on both
sides,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Will ended, smiling brightly at Dorothea, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was still
looking with serious intentness before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), like a child seeing a drama
for the first time.

<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face, too, broke into a smile as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``That is your
apology, I suppose, for having yourself been rather rebellious; I mean,
to Mr. Casaubon's wishes. You must remember that you have not done
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thought best for you. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dislikes you--you were
speaking of dislike a little while ago--but I should rather say, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
has shown any painful feelings towards you, you must consider how
sensitive he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has become from the wearing effect of study. Perhaps,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) continued, getting into a pleading tone, <div class="bookquote">``my uncle has not told you
how serious Mr. Casaubon's illness was. It would be very petty of us
who are well and can bear things, to think much of small offences from
those who carry a weight of trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You teach me better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``I will never grumble on that
subject again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>There was a gentleness in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tone which came from the
unutterable contentment of perceiving--what Dorothea was hardly
conscious of--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity
and loyalty towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband. Will was ready to adore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pity and
loyalty, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would associate himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in manifesting them.
<div class="bookquote">``I have really sometimes been a perverse fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``but I
will never again, if I can help it, do or say what you would
disapprove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very good of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with another open smile. <div class="bookquote">``I
shall have a little kingdom then, where I shall give laws. But you
will soon go away, out of my rule, I imagine. You will soon be tired
of staying at the Grange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a point I wanted to mention to you--one of the reasons why I
wished to speak to you alone. Mr. Brooke proposes that I should stay
in this neighborhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) has bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) wishes me to conduct that, and also to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) in other ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would not that be a sacrifice of higher prospects for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps; but I have always been blamed for thinking of prospects, and
not settling to anything. And here is something offered to me. If you
would not like me to accept it, I will give it up. Otherwise I would
rather stay in this part of the country than go away. I belong to
nobody anywhere else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like you to stay very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, at once, as
simply and readily as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had spoken at Rome. There was not the shadow
of a reason in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind at the moment why she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should not say so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I _will_ stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Ladislaw, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) head backward, rising
and going towards the window, as if to see whether the rain had ceased.

<p/>But the next moment, Dorothea, according to a habit which was getting
continually stronger, began to reflect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband felt
differently from herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) colored deeply under the double
embarrassment of having expressed what might be in opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's feeling, and of having to suggest this opposition to Will.
His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face was not turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and this made it easier to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But my opinion is of little consequence on such a subject. I think
you should be guided by Mr. Casaubon. I spoke without thinking of
anything else than my own feeling, which has nothing to do with the
real question. But it now occurs to me--perhaps Mr. Casaubon might
see that the proposal was not wise. Can you not wait now and mention
it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't wait to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Will, inwardly seared by the possibility
that Mr. Casaubon would enter. <div class="bookquote">``The rain is quite over now. I told
Mr. Brooke not to call for me: I would rather walk the five miles. I
shall strike across Halsell Common, and see the gleams on the wet
grass. I like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to shake hands quite hurriedly, longing but not
daring to say, <div class="bookquote">``Don't mention the subject to Mr. Casaubon.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
dared not, could not say it. To ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to be less simple and direct
would be like breathing on the crystal that you want to see the light
through. And there was always the other great dread--of himself
becoming dimmed and forever ray-shorn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you could have stayed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with a touch of
mournfulness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) also had her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
thought which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not like to express:--Will certainly ought to
lose no time in consulting Mr. Casaubon's wishes, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to urge
this might seem an undue dictation.

<p/>So they only said <div class="bookquote">``Good-by,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>and Will quitted the house, striking
across the fields so as not to run any risk of encountering Mr.
Casaubon's carriage, which, however, did not appear at the gate until
four o'clock. That was an unpropitious hour for coming home: it was too
early to gain the moral support under ennui of dressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) person for
dinner, and too late to undress his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind of the day's frivolous
ceremony and affairs, so as to be prepared for a good plunge into the
serious business of study. On such occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) usually threw into an
easy-chair in the library, and allowed Dorothea to read the London
papers to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyes the while. To-day, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
declined that relief, observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had already had too many public
details urged upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) spoke more cheerfully than usual, when
Dorothea asked about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) fatigue, and added with that air of formal
effort which never forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) spoke without his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) waistcoat
and cravat--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have had the gratification of meeting my former acquaintance, Dr.
Spanning, to-day, and of being praised by one who is himself a worthy
recipient of praise. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) spoke very handsomely of my late tractate on
the Egyptian Mysteries,--using, in fact, terms which it would not
become me to repeat.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In uttering the last clause, Mr. Casaubon leaned
over the elbow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) chair, and swayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head up and down,
apparently as a muscular outlet instead of that recapitulation which
would not have been becoming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you have had that pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, delighted
to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband less weary than usual at this hour. <div class="bookquote">``Before you
came I had been regretting that you happened to be out to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, throwing himself backward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because Mr. Ladislaw has been here; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has mentioned a proposal of
my uncle's which I should like to know your opinion of.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt was really concerned in this question. Even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
ignorance of the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had a vague impression that the position
offered to Will was out of keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) family connections, and
certainly Mr. Casaubon had a claim to be consulted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not speak,
but merely bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear uncle, you know, has many projects. It appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has
bought one of the Middlemarch newspapers, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has asked Mr. Ladislaw
to stay in this neighborhood and conduct the paper for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), besides
helping him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) in other ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had at first
blinked and finally closed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) eyes, as if to save them; while his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lips
became more tense. <div class="bookquote">``What is your opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, rather timidly,
after a slight pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Ladislaw come on purpose to ask my opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Casaubon, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyes narrowly with a knife-edged look at
Dorothea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was really uncomfortable on the point he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) inquired about,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) only became a little more serious, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes did not swerve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) answered immediately, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) did not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) came to ask
your opinion. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mentioned the proposal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) of course
expected me to tell you of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon was silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I feared that you might feel some objection. But certainly a young
man with so much talent might be very useful to my uncle--might help
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to do good in a better way. And Mr. Ladislaw wishes to have some
fixed occupation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has been blamed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) says, for not seeking
something of that kind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would like to stay in this neighborhood
because no one cares for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt that this was a consideration to soften her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not speak, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) presently recurred to Dr. Spanning
and the Archdeacon's breakfast. But there was no longer sunshine on
these subjects.

<p/>The next morning, without Dorothea's knowledge, Mr. Casaubon despatched
the following letter, beginning <div class="bookquote">``Dear Mr. Ladislaw''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had always
before addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``Will'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-RRB-:--


<p/>``Mrs. Casaubon informs me that a proposal has been made to you, and
-LRB-according to an inference by no means stretched-RRB- has on your part been
in some degree entertained, which involves your residence in this
neighborhood in a capacity which I am justified in saying touches my
own position in such a way as renders it not only natural and
warrantable in me when that effect is viewed under the influence of
legitimate feeling, but incumbent on me when the same effect is
considered in the light of my responsibilities, to state at once that
your acceptance of the proposal above indicated would be highly
offensive to me. That I have some claim to the exercise of a veto
here, would not, I believe, be denied by any reasonable person
cognizant of the relations between us: relations which, though thrown
into the past by your recent procedure, are not thereby annulled in
their character of determining antecedents. I will not here make
reflections on any person's judgment. It is enough for me to point out
to yourself that there are certain social fitnesses and proprieties
which should hinder a somewhat near relative of mine from becoming any
wise conspicuous in this vicinity in a status not only much beneath my
own, but associated at best with the sciolism of literary or political
adventurers. At any rate, the contrary issue must exclude you from
further reception at my house.

<p/>Yours faithfully,
<div class="bookquote">``EDWARD CASAUBON.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Dorothea's mind was innocently at work towards the further
embitterment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband; dwelling, with a sympathy that grew to
agitation, on what Will had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) parents and
grandparents. Any private hours in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) day were usually spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
blue-green boudoir, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had come to be very fond of its pallid
quaintness. Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the
summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue
of elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an
inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels,
the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or our
spiritual falls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been so used to struggle for and to find
resolve in looking along the avenue towards the arch of western light
that the vision itself had gained a communicating power. Even the pale
stag seemed to have reminding glances and to mean mutely, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, we
know.''  (<font color='red'><b>an audience</b></font>)</div>And the group of delicately touched miniatures had made an
audience as of beings no longer disturbed about their own earthly lot,
but still humanly interested. Especially the mysterious <div class="bookquote">``Aunt Julia''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>about whom Dorothea had never found it easy to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband.

<p/>And now, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) conversation with Will, many fresh images had
gathered round that Aunt Julia who was Will's grandmother; the presence
of that delicate miniature, so like a living face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) knew,
helping to concentrate her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) feelings. What a wrong, to cut off the girl
from the family protection and inheritance only because she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had chosen
a man who was poor! Dorothea, early troubling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) elders with
questions about the facts around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), had wrought herself into some
independent clearness as to the historical, political reasons why
eldest sons had superior rights, and why land should be entailed: those
reasons, impressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with a certain awe, might be weightier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
knew, but here was a question of ties which left them uninfringed.
Here was a daughter whose child--even according to the ordinary aping
of aristocratic institutions by people who are no more aristocratic
than retired grocers, and who have no more land to <div class="bookquote">``keep together''  (<font color='red'><b>grocers</b></font>)</div>than
a lawn and a paddock--would have a prior claim. Was inheritance a
question of liking or of responsibility? All the energy of Dorothea's
nature went on the side of responsibility--the fulfilment of claims
founded on our own deeds, such as marriage and parentage.

<p/>It was true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to herself, that Mr. Casaubon had a debt to the
Ladislaws--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had to pay back what the Ladislaws had been wronged
of. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) began to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's will, which had been
made at the time of their marriage, leaving the bulk of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) property to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), with proviso in case of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) having children. That ought to be
altered; and no time ought to be lost. This very question which had
just arisen about Will Ladislaw's occupation, was the occasion for
placing things on a new, right footing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sure,
according to all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) previous conduct, would be ready to take the just
view, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) proposed it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), in whose interest an unfair
concentration of the property had been urged. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sense of right had
surmounted and would continue to surmount anything that might be called
antipathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) suspected that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's scheme was disapproved by
Mr. Casaubon, and this made it seem all the more opportune that a fresh
understanding should be begun, so that instead of Will's starting
penniless and accepting the first function that offered itself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
should find himself in possession of a rightful income which should be
paid by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life, and, by an immediate alteration of
the will, should be secured at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death. The vision of all this as
what ought to be done seemed to Dorothea like a sudden letting in of
daylight, waking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) previous stupidity and incurious
self-absorbed ignorance about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's relation to others. Will
Ladislaw had refused Mr. Casaubon's future aid on a ground that no
longer appeared right to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); and Mr. Casaubon had never himself seen
fully what was the claim upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>CASAUBON</b></font>) will!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``The
great strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>CASAUBON</b></font>) character lies here. And what are we doing with
our money? We make no use of half of our income. My own money buys me
nothing but an uneasy conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a peculiar fascination for Dorothea in this division of
property intended for herself, and always regarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as excessive.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was blind, you see, to many things obvious to others--likely to
tread in the wrong places, as Celia had warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>); yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) blindness
to whatever did not lie in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) own pure purpose carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) safely by
the side of precipices where vision would have been perilous with fear.

<p/>The thoughts which had gathered vividness in the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
boudoir occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) incessantly through the day on which Mr. Casaubon
had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) letter to Will. Everything seemed hindrance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) could find an opportunity of opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband. To
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) preoccupied mind all subjects were to be approached gently, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
had never since his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) illness lost from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) consciousness the dread of
agitating him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). But when young ardor is set brooding over the
conception of a prompt deed, the deed itself seems to start forth with
independent life, mastering ideal obstacles. The day passed in a
sombre fashion, not unusual, though Mr. Casaubon was perhaps unusually
silent; but there were hours of the night which might be counted on as
opportunities of conversation; for Dorothea, when aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's sleeplessness, had established a habit of rising, lighting a
candle, and reading him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to sleep again. And this night she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was from
the beginning sleepless, excited by resolves. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) slept as usual for a
few hours, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had risen softly and had sat in the darkness for
nearly an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, since you are up, will you light a candle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel ill, dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first question, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all; but I shall be obliged, since you are up, if you will
read me a few pages of Lowth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I talk to you a little instead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been thinking about money all day--that I have always had too
much, and especially the prospect of too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These, my dear Dorothea, are providential arrangements.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if one has too much in consequence of others being wronged, it
seems to me that the divine voice which tells us to set that wrong
right must be obeyed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, my love, is the bearing of your remark?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That you have been too liberal in arrangements for me--I mean, with
regard to property; and that makes me unhappy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How so? I have none but comparatively distant connections.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been led to think about your aunt Julia, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was left
in poverty only because she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) married a poor man, an act which was not
disgraceful, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not unworthy. It was on that ground, I know,
that you educated Mr. Ladislaw and provided for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea waited a few moments for some answer that would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
onward. None came, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) next words seemed the more forcible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
falling clear upon the dark silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But surely we should regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) claim as a much greater one, even to
the half of that property which I know that you have destined for me.
And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) ought at once to be provided for on that understanding.
It is not right that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) should be in the dependence of poverty while we
are rich. And if there is any objection to the proposal he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mentioned,
the giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) true place and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) true share would set aside any
motive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) accepting it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw has probably been speaking to you on this subject?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Casaubon, with a certain biting quickness not habitual to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``How can you imagine it, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has so lately declined everything from you? I fear you think too
hardly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) only told me a little about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) parents and
grandparents, and almost all in answer to my questions. You are so
good, so just--you have done everything you thought to be right. But
it seems to me clear that more than that is right; and I must speak
about it, since I am the person who would get what is called benefit by
that `more' not being done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a perceptible pause before Mr. Casaubon replied, not quickly
as before, but with a still more biting emphasis.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea, my love, this is not the first occasion, but it were well
that it should be the last, on which you have assumed a judgment on
subjects beyond your scope. Into the question how far conduct,
especially in the matter of alliances, constitutes a forfeiture of
family claims, I do not now enter. Suffice it, that you are not here
qualified to discriminate. What I now wish you to understand is, that
I accept no revision, still less dictation within that range of affairs
which I have deliberated upon as distinctly and properly mine. It is
not for you to interfere between me and Mr. Ladislaw, and still less to
encourage communications from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to you which constitute a criticism
on my procedure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Dorothea, shrouded in the darkness, was in a tumult of conflicting
emotions. Alarm at the possible effect on himself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
strongly manifested anger, would have checked any expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
resentment, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been quite free from doubt and compunction
under the consciousness that there might be some justice in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last
insinuation. Hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) breathe quickly after he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had spoken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat
listening, frightened, wretched--with a dumb inward cry for help to
bear this nightmare of a life in which every energy was arrested by
dread. But nothing else happened, except that they both remained a
long while sleepless, without speaking again.

<p/>The next day, Mr. Casaubon received the following answer from Will
Ladislaw:--


<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR MR. CASAUBON,--I have given all due consideration to your letter
of yesterday, but I am unable to take precisely your view of our mutual
position. With the fullest acknowledgment of your generous conduct to
me in the past, I must still maintain that an obligation of this kind
cannot fairly fetter me as you appear to expect that it should.
Granted that a benefactor's wishes may constitute a claim; there must
always be a reservation as to the quality of those wishes. They may
possibly clash with more imperative considerations. Or a benefactor's
veto might impose such a negation on a man's life that the consequent
blank might be more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am
merely using strong illustrations. In the present case I am unable to
take your view of the bearing which my acceptance of occupation--not
enriching certainly, but not dishonorable--will have on your own
position which seems to me too substantial to be affected in that
shadowy manner. And though I do not believe that any change in our
relations will occur -LRB-certainly none has yet occurred-RRB- which can
nullify the obligations imposed on me by the past, pardon me for not
seeing that those obligations should restrain me from using the
ordinary freedom of living where I choose, and maintaining myself by
any lawful occupation I may choose. Regretting that there exists this
difference between us as to a relation in which the conferring of
benefits has been entirely on your side--

<p/>I remain, yours with persistent obligation,
WILL LADISLAW.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Mr. Casaubon felt -LRB-and must not we, being impartial, feel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
a little?-RRB- that no man had juster cause for disgust and suspicion than
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Young Ladislaw, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was sure, meant to defy and annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), meant to
win Dorothea's confidence and sow her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind with disrespect, and perhaps
aversion, towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband. Some motive beneath the surface had
been needed to account for Will's sudden change of course in rejecting Mr.
Casaubon's aid and quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) travels; and this defiant determination
to fix himself in the neighborhood by taking up something so much at
variance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) former choice as Mr. Brooke's Middlemarch projects,
revealed clearly enough that the undeclared motive had relation to
Dorothea. Not for one moment did Mr. Casaubon suspect Dorothea of any
doubleness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had no suspicions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had -LRB-what was little
less uncomfortable-RRB- the positive knowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tendency to form
opinions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's conduct was accompanied with a disposition
to regard Will Ladislaw favorably and be influenced by what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) said.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own proud reticence had prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) from ever being undeceived in
the supposition that Dorothea had originally asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle to invite
Will to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) house.

<p/>And now, on receiving Will's letter, Mr. Casaubon had to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
duty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would never have been easy to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) action anything else
than duty; but in this case, contending motives thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) back into
negations.

<p/>Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) apply directly to Mr. Brooke, and demand of that troublesome
gentleman to revoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) proposal? Or should he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) consult Sir James
Chettam, and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) to concur in remonstrance against a step which
touched the whole family? In either case Mr. Casaubon was aware that
failure was just as probable as success. It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to
mention Dorothea's name in the matter, and without some alarming
urgency Mr. Brooke was as likely as not, after meeting all
representations with apparent assent, to wind up by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Never
fear, Casaubon! Depend upon it, young Ladislaw will do you credit.
Depend upon it, I have put my finger on the right thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>And Mr.
Casaubon shrank nervously from communicating on the subject with Sir
James Chettam, between whom and himself there had never been any
cordiality, and who would immediately think of Dorothea without any
mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Mr. Casaubon was distrustful of everybody's feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),
especially as a husband. To let any one suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was jealous
would be to admit their -LRB-suspected-RRB- view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) disadvantages: to let
them know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not find marriage particularly blissful would
imply his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) conversion to their -LRB-probably-RRB- earlier disapproval. It would
be as bad as letting Carp, and Brasenose generally, know how backward
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was in organizing the matter for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Key to all Mythologies.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All
through his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) life Mr. Casaubon had been trying not to admit even to
himself the inward sores of self-doubt and jealousy. And on the most
delicate of all personal subjects, the habit of proud suspicious
reticence told doubly.

<p/>Thus Mr. Casaubon remained proudly, bitterly silent. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had
forbidden Will to come to Lowick Manor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was mentally preparing
other measures of frustration.



<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``C'est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions
humaines; tôt ou tard il devient efficace.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--GUIZOT.


<p/>Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on Mr. Brooke's
new courses; but it was easier to object than to hinder. Sir James
accounted for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) having come in alone one day to lunch with the
Cadwalladers by saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>).
Indeed, it would not be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>``I know what you mean--the ``Pioneer' at the Grange!'' darted in Mrs.
Cadwallader, almost before the last word was off her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) friend's tongue.
<div class="bookquote">``It is frightful--this taking to buying whistles and blowing them in
everybody's hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at dominoes,
like poor Lord Plessy, would be more private and bearable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see they are beginning to attack our friend Brooke in the
`Trumpet,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, lounging back and smiling easily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>)
would have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) had been attacked himself. <div class="bookquote">``There are tremendous
sarcasms against a landlord not a hundred miles from Middlemarch, who
receives his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own rents, and makes no returns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do wish Brooke would leave that off,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
little frown of annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) really going to be put in nomination, though?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``I saw Farebrother yesterday--he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)'s Whiggish himself,
hoists Brougham and Useful Knowledge; that's the worst I know of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>);--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) says that Brooke is getting up a pretty strong party.
Bulstrode, the banker, is his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) foremost man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) thinks Brooke would
come off badly at a nomination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with earnestness. <div class="bookquote">``I have been inquiring
into the thing, for I've never known anything about Middlemarch
politics before--the county being my business. What Brooke trusts to,
is that they are going to turn out Oliver because he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is a Peelite. But
Hawley tells me that if they send up a Whig at all it is sure to be
Bagster, one of those candidates who come from heaven knows where, but
dead against Ministers, and an experienced Parliamentary man. Hawley's
rather rough: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) forgot that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) was speaking to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) said if Brooke
wanted a pelting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) could get it cheaper than by going to the
hustings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I warned you all of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) hands
outward. <div class="bookquote">``I said to Humphrey long ago, Mr. Brooke is going to make a
splash in the mud. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) has done it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) might have taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) head to marry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector.
<div class="bookquote">``That would have been a graver mess than a little flirtation with
politics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) may do that afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader--<div class="bookquote">``when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) has come
out on the other side of the mud with an ague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What I care for most is his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own dignity,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
I care the more because of the family. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)'s getting on in life
now, and I don't like to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) exposing himself. They will be
raking up everything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose it's no use trying any persuasion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector.
<div class="bookquote">``There's such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in Brooke.
Have you tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) on the subject?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James; <div class="bookquote">``I feel a delicacy in appearing to dictate.
But I have been talking to this young Ladislaw that Brooke is making a
factotum of. Ladislaw seems clever enough for anything. I thought it
as well to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had to say; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is against Brooke's standing
this time. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)'ll turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) round: I think the nomination may be
staved off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, nodding. <div class="bookquote">``The independent member

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this Ladislaw--there again is a vexatious business,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir

have met him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), by the bye-RRB- as Brooke's guest and a relation of
Casaubon's, thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was only on a flying visit. And now I find
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)'s in everybody's mouth in Middlemarch as the editor of the
``Pioneer.<div class="bookquote">'' There are stories going about him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) as a quill-driving alien,
a foreign emissary, and what not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Casaubon won't like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There _is_ some foreign blood in Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>returned Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)'s a dangerous young sprig, that Mr. Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) opera songs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) ready tongue. A sort of

``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has more right to interfere than I. But it's a disagreeable affair
all round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to
show himself in!--one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to
look at Keck, who manages the ``Trumpet.<div class="bookquote">'' I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) the other day with
Hawley. His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) writing is sound enough, I believe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s such a low
fellow, that I wished he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been on the wrong side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can you expect with these peddling Middlemarch papers?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the
Rector. <div class="bookquote">``I don't suppose you could get a high style of man anywhere to
be writing up interests he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't really care about, and for pay that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly: that makes it so annoying that Brooke should have put a man
who has a sort of connection with the family in a position of that

pleasant to find everybody, you know. Well, what do you think of
things?--going on a little fast! It was true enough, what Lafitte
said--<div class="bookquote">``Since yesterday, a century has passed away:'--they're in the
next century, you know, on the other side of the water. Going on
faster than we are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, taking up the newspaper. ``Here is the
<div class="bookquote">``Trumpet' accusing you of lagging behind--did you see?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eh? no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) gloves into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hat and hastily
adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass. But Mr. Cadwallader kept the paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
hand, saying, with a smile in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) eyes--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here! all this is about a landlord not a hundred miles from
Middlemarch, who receives his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own rents. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is the most
retrogressive man in the county. I think you must have taught them
that word in the `Pioneer.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, that is Keck--an illiterate fellow, you know. Retrogressive, now!
Come, that's capital. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thinks it means destructive: they want to
make me out a destructive, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with that
cheerfulness which is usually sustained by an adversary's ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows the meaning of the word. Here is a sharp stroke or
two. If we had to describe a man who is retrogressive in the most evil
sense of the word--we should say, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is one who would dub himself a
reformer of our constitution, while every interest for which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
immediately responsible is going to decay: a philanthropist who cannot
bear one rogue to be hanged, but does not mind five honest tenants
being half-starved: a man who shrieks at corruption, and keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
farms at rack-rent: who roars himself red at rotten boroughs, and does
not mind if every field on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farms has a rotten gate: a man very
open-hearted to Leeds and Manchester, no doubt; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give any
number of representatives who will pay for their seats out of their own
pockets: what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) objects to giving, is a little return on rent-days to
help a tenant to buy stock, or an outlay on repairs to keep the weather
out at a tenant's barn-door or make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house look a little less like
an Irish cottier's. But we all know the wag's definition of a
philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of
the distance. And so on. All the rest is to show what sort of
legislator a philanthropist is likely to make,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>ended the Rector,
throwing down the paper, and clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) hands at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>)
head, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) looked at Mr. Brooke with an air of amused neutrality.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, that's rather good, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, taking up the
paper and trying to bear the attack as easily as his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) neighbor did, but
coloring and smiling rather nervously; ``that about roaring himself red
at rotten boroughs--I never made a speech about rotten boroughs in my
life. And as to roaring myself red and that kind of thing--these men
never understand what is good satire. Satire, you know, should be true
up to a certain point. I recollect they said that in <div class="bookquote">``The Edinburgh'
somewhere--it must be true up to a certain point.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that is really a hit about the gates,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, anxious
to tread carefully. <div class="bookquote">``Dagley complained to me the other day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>)
hadn't got a decent gate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) farm. Garth has invented a new pattern
of gate--I wish you would try it. One ought to use some of one's
timber in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You go in for fancy farming, you know, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought the most expensive hobby in the world was standing for
Parliament,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``They said the last unsuccessful
candidate at Middlemarch--Giles, wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Giles</b></font>) name?--spent ten thousand

reflection for a man!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Somebody was saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, laughingly, <div class="bookquote">``that East Retford
was nothing to Middlemarch, for bribery.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing of the kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``The Tories bribe, you know:
Hawley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) set bribe with treating, hot codlings, and that sort of
thing; and they bring the voters drunk to the poll. But they are not
going to have it their own way in future--not in future, you know.
Middlemarch is a little backward, I admit--the freemen are a little
backward. But we shall educate them--we shall bring them on, you
know. The best people there are on our side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hawley says you have men on your side who will do you harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>remarked
Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) says Bulstrode the banker will do you harm.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that if you got pelted,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Cadwallader, <div class="bookquote">``half the
rotten eggs would mean hatred of your committee-man. Good heavens!
Think what it must be to be pelted for wrong opinions. And I seem to
remember a story of a man they pretended to chair and let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fall into

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pelting is nothing to their finding holes in one's coat,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the

had to stand at the hustings for preferment. I should be afraid of
their reckoning up all my fishing days. Upon my word, I think the
truth is the hardest missile one can be pelted with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, <div class="bookquote">``if a man goes into public life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
be prepared for the consequences. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must make himself proof against
calumny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Chettam, that is all very fine, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``But how will you make yourself proof against calumny? You should read
history--look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of
thing. They always happen to the best men, you know. But what is that
in Horace?--`fiat justitia, ruat ... something or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with a little more heat than usual. <div class="bookquote">``What I
mean by being proof against calumny is being able to point to the fact
as a contradiction.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And it is not martyrdom to pay bills that one has run into one's
self,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader.

<p/>But it was Sir James's evident annoyance that most stirred Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said, rising, taking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hat and
leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) stick, <div class="bookquote">``you and I have a different system. You are all
for outlay with your farms. I don't want to make out that my system is
good under all circumstances--under all circumstances, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There ought to be a new valuation made from time to time,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James. <div class="bookquote">``Returns are very well occasionally, but I like a fair
valuation. What do you say, Cadwallader?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``I agree with you. If I were Brooke, I would choke the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet' at
once by getting Garth to make a new valuation of the farms, and giving
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) carte blanche about gates and repairs: that's my view of the
political situation,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, broadening himself by sticking
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) thumbs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) armholes, and laughing towards Mr. Brooke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a showy sort of thing to do, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``But
I should like you to tell me of another landlord who has distressed his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
tenants for arrears as little as I have. I let the old tenants stay
on. I'm uncommonly easy, let me tell you, uncommonly easy. I have my
own ideas, and I take my stand on them, you know. A man who does that
is always charged with eccentricity, inconsistency, and that kind of
thing. When I change my line of action, I shall follow my own ideas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>After that, Mr. Brooke remembered that there was a packet which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
omitted to send off from the Grange, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grange</b></font>) bade everybody hurriedly
good-by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to take a liberty with Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James; <div class="bookquote">``I see
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nettled. But as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says about old tenants, in point of
fact no new tenant would take the farms on the present terms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be brought round in time,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the
Rector. ``But you were pulling one way, Elinor, and we were pulling
another. You wanted to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away from expense, and we want to
frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into it. Better let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) try to be popular and see that
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character as a landlord stands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way. I don't think it
signifies two straws about the ``Pioneer,<div class="bookquote">'' or Ladislaw, or Brooke's
speechifying to the Middlemarchers. But it does signify about the
parishioners in Tipton being comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, it is you two who are on the wrong tack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``You should have proved to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses money by bad
management, and then we should all have pulled together. If you put
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a-horseback on politics, I warn you of the consequences. It was
all very well to ride on sticks at home and call them ideas.''

<p/>Sir James Chettam's mind was not fruitful in devices, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) growing
anxiety to <div class="bookquote">``act on Brooke,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>once brought close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) constant belief
in Dorothea's capacity for influence, became formative, and issued in a
little plan; namely, to plead Celia's indisposition as a reason for
fetching Dorothea by herself to the Hall, and to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at the
Grange with the carriage on the way, after making her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fully aware of
the situation concerning the management of the estate.

<p/>In this way it happened that one day near four o'clock, when Mr. Brooke
and Ladislaw were seated in the library, the door opened and Mrs.
Casaubon was announced.

<p/>Will, the moment before, had been low in the depths of boredom, and,
obliged to help Mr. Brooke in arranging <div class="bookquote">``documents''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>about hanging
sheep-stealers, was exemplifying the power our minds have of riding
several horses at once by inwardly arranging measures towards getting a
lodging for himself in Middlemarch and cutting short his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) constant
residence at the Grange; while there flitted through all these steadier
images a tickling vision of a sheep-stealing epic written with Homeric
particularity. When Mrs. Casaubon was announced he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) started up as from
an electric shock, and felt a tingling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) finger-ends. Any one
observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would have seen a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) complexion, in the
adjustment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) facial muscles, in the vividness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) glance, which
might have made them imagine that every molecule in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) body had passed
the message of a magic touch. And so it had. For effective magic is
transcendent nature; and who shall measure the subtlety of those
touches which convey the quality of soul as well as body, and make a
man's passion for one woman differ from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passion for another as joy
in the morning light over valley and river and white mountain-top
differs from joy among Chinese lanterns and glass panels? Will, too,
was made of very impressible stuff. The bow of a violin drawn near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
cleverly, would at one stroke change the aspect of the world for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) point of view shifted--as easily as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mood. Dorothea's
entrance was the freshness of morning.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, this is pleasant, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, meeting and
kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``You have left Casaubon with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) books, I suppose.
That's right. We must not have you getting too learned for a woman,
you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no fear of that, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, turning to Will and
shaking hands with open cheerfulness, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) made no other form of
greeting, but went on answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle. <div class="bookquote">``I am very slow. When I
want to be busy with books, I am often playing truant among my
thoughts. I find it is not so easy to be learned as to plan cottages.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seated herself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle opposite to Will, and was evidently
preoccupied with something that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) almost unmindful of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
was ridiculously disappointed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had imagined that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) coming
had anything to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, my dear, it was quite your hobby to draw plans. But it was
good to break that off a little. Hobbies are apt to ran away with us,
you know; it doesn't do to be run away with. We must keep the reins.
I have never let myself be run away with; I always pulled up. That is
what I tell Ladislaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) and I are alike, you know: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) likes to go
into everything. We are working at capital punishment. We shall do a
great deal together, Ladislaw and I.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with characteristic directness, <div class="bookquote">``Sir James has
been telling me that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is in hope of seeing a great change made soon
in your management of the estate--that you are thinking of having the
farms valued, and repairs made, and the cottages improved, so that
Tipton may look quite another place. Oh, how happy!'' (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on,
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands, with a return to that more childlike impetuous
manner, which had been subdued since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage. <div class="bookquote">``If I were at home
still, I should take to riding again, that I might go about with you
and see all that! And you are going to engage Mr. Garth, who praised
my cottages, Sir James says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Chettam is a little hasty, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, coloring
slightly; <div class="bookquote">``a little hasty, you know. I never said I should do anything
of the kind. I never said I should _not_ do it, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) only feels confident that you will do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a
voice as clear and unhesitating as that of a young chorister chanting a
credo, <div class="bookquote">``because you mean to enter Parliament as a member who cares for
the improvement of the people, and one of the first things to be made
better is the state of the land and the laborers. Think of Kit Downes,
uncle, who lives with his (<font color='blue'><b>Downes</b></font>) wife and seven children in a house with one
sitting room and one bedroom hardly larger than this table!--and those
poor Dagleys, in their tumble-down farmhouse, where they live in the
back kitchen and leave the other rooms to the rats! That is one reason
why I did not like the pictures here, dear uncle--which you think me
stupid about. I used to come from the village with all that dirt and
coarse ugliness like a pain within me, and the simpering pictures in
the drawing-room seemed to me like a wicked attempt to find delight in
what is false, while we don't mind how hard the truth is for the
neighbors outside our walls. I think we have no right to come forward
and urge wider changes for good, until we have tried to alter the evils
which lie under our own hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a chorister</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea had gathered emotion as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on, and had forgotten
everything except the relief of pouring forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feelings, unchecked:
an experience once habitual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), but hardly ever present since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
marriage, which had been a perpetual struggle of energy with fear. For
the moment, Will's admiration was accompanied with a chilling sense of
remoteness. A man is seldom ashamed of feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot love a
woman so well when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees a certain greatness in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): nature having
intended greatness for men. But nature has sometimes made sad
oversights in carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) intention; as in the case of good Mr.
Brooke, whose masculine consciousness was at this moment in rather a
stammering condition under the eloquence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) niece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could not
immediately find any other mode of expressing himself than that of
rising, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass, and fingering the papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). At
last he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something in what you say, my dear, something in what you
say--but not everything--eh, Ladislaw? You and I don't like our
pictures and statues being found fault with. Young ladies are a little
ardent, you know--a little one-sided, my dear. Fine art, poetry, that
kind of thing, elevates a nation--emollit mores--you understand a
little Latin now. But--eh? what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>These interrogatives were addressed to the footman who had come in to
say that the keeper had found one of Dagley's boys with a leveret in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) hand just killed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll come, I'll come. I shall let him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) off easily, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brooke aside to Dorothea, shuffling away very cheerfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you feel how right this change is that I--that Sir James wishes
for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea to Will, as soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, now I have heard you speak about it. I shall not forget what
you have said. But can you think of something else at this moment? I
may not have another opportunity of speaking to you about what has
occurred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, rising with a movement of impatience, and holding
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) chair with both hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray tell me what it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, anxiously, also rising and
going to the open window, where Monk was looking in, panting and
wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) tail. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) back against the window-frame, and
laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand on the dog's head; for though, as we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not
fond of pets that must be held in the hands or trodden on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
always attentive to the feelings of dogs, and very polite if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had to
decline their advances.

<p/>Will followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) only with his (<font color='blue'><b>Monk</b></font>) eyes and said, <div class="bookquote">``I presume you know that
Mr. Casaubon has forbidden me to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I did not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, after a moment's pause. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
evidently much moved. <div class="bookquote">``I am very, very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, mournfully.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was thinking of what Will had no knowledge of--the conversation
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband in the darkness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was anew smitten
with hopelessness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could influence Mr. Casaubon's action. But
the marked expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sorrow convinced Will that it was not all
given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) personally, and that Dorothea had not been visited by the
idea that Mr. Casaubon's dislike and jealousy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) turned upon
herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) felt an odd mixture of delight and vexation: of delight
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could dwell and be cherished in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought as in a pure home,
without suspicion and without stint--of vexation because he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was of too
little account with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), was not formidable enough, was treated with an
unhesitating benevolence which did not flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). But his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dread of
any change in Dorothea was stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) discontent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) began
to speak again in a tone of mere explanation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon's reason is, his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) displeasure at my taking a position here
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) considers unsuited to my rank as his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cousin. I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
that I cannot give way on this point. It is a little too hard on me to
expect that my course in life is to be hampered by prejudices which I
think ridiculous. Obligation may be stretched till it is no better
than a brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know
its meaning. I would not have accepted the position if I had not meant
to make it useful and honorable. I am not bound to regard family
dignity in any other light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband altogether in the
wrong, on more grounds than Will had mentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is better for us not to speak on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, with a
tremulousness not common in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``since you and Mr. Casaubon
disagree. You intend to remain?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking out on the lawn,
with melancholy meditation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I shall hardly ever see you now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, in a tone of
almost boyish complaint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes full upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``hardly ever. But
I shall hear of you. I shall know what you are doing for my uncle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall know hardly anything about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``No one will tell
me anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my life is very simple,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lips curling with an
exquisite smile, which irradiated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) melancholy. <div class="bookquote">``I am always at
Lowick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a dreadful imprisonment,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, impetuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, don't think that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I have no longings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) did not speak, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) replied to some change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) expression. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean, for myself. Except that I should like not to have so much more
than my share without doing anything for others. But I have a belief
of my own, and it comforts me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, rather jealous of the belief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don't quite know
what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power
against evil--widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with
darkness narrower.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a beautiful mysticism--it is a--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please not to call it by any name,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
hands entreatingly. <div class="bookquote">``You will say it is Persian, or something else
geographical. It is my life. I have found it out, and cannot part
with it. I have always been finding out my religion since I was a
little girl. I used to pray so much--now I hardly ever pray. I try
not to have desires merely for myself, because they may not be good for
others, and I have too much already. I only told you, that you might
know quite well how my days go at Lowick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you for telling me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, ardently, and rather
wondering at himself. They were looking at each other like two fond
children who were talking confidentially of birds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is _your_ religion?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I mean--not what you know
about religion, but the belief that helps you most?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To love what is good and beautiful when I see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``But I
am a rebel: I don't feel bound, as you do, to submit to what I don't
like.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you like what is good, that comes to the same thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are subtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; Mr. Casaubon often says I am too subtle. I don't feel as if I
were subtle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, playfully. <div class="bookquote">``But how long my uncle is! I
must go and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). I must really go on to the Hall. Celia is
expecting me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Will offered to tell Mr. Brooke, who presently came and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
would step into the carriage and go with Dorothea as far as Dagley's,
to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the
leveret. Dorothea renewed the subject of the estate as they drove
along, but Mr. Brooke, not being taken unawares, got the talk under his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
own control.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chettam, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) finds fault with me, my dear; but I
should not preserve my game if it were not for Chettam, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) can't
say that that expense is for the sake of the tenants, you know. It's a
little against my feeling:--poaching, now, if you come to look into
it--I have often thought of getting up the subject. Not long ago,
Flavell, the Methodist preacher, was brought up for knocking down a
hare that came across his (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) path when he (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) wife were walking out
together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) was pretty quick, and knocked it on the neck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was very brutal, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea

<p/>``Well, now, it seemed rather black to me, I confess, in a Methodist
preacher, you know. And Johnson said, ``You may judge what a
_hypocrite_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) is.<div class="bookquote">'' And upon my word, I thought Flavell looked very
little like `the highest style of man'--as somebody calls the
Christian--Young, the poet Young, I think--you know Young? Well, now,
Flavell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) shabby black gaiters, pleading that he (<font color='blue'><b>Flavell</b></font>) thought the Lord
had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife a good dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had a right to knock it
down, though not a mighty hunter before the Lord, as Nimrod was--I
assure you it was rather comic: Fielding would have made something of
it--or Scott, now--Scott might have worked it up. But really, when I
came to think of it, I couldn't help liking that the fellow should have
a bit of hare to say grace over. It's all a matter of
prejudice--prejudice with the law on its side, you know--about the
stick and the gaiters, and so on. However, it doesn't do to reason
about things; and law is law. But I got Johnson to be quiet, and I
hushed the matter up. I doubt whether Chettam would not have been more
severe, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) comes down on me as if I were the hardest man in the
county. But here we are at Dagley's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke got down at a farmyard-gate, and Dorothea drove on. It is
wonderful how much uglier things will look when we only suspect that we
are blamed for them. Even our own persons in the glass are apt to
change their aspect for us after we have heard some frank remark on
their less admirable points; and on the other hand it is astonishing
how pleasantly conscience takes our encroachments on those who never
complain or have nobody to complain for them. Dagley's homestead never
before looked so dismal to Mr. Brooke as it did today, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind
thus sore about the fault-finding of the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>echoed by Sir James.

<p/>It is true that an observer, under that softening influence of the fine
arts which makes other people's hardships picturesque, might have been
delighted with this homestead called Freeman's End: the old house had
dormer-windows in the dark red roof, two of the chimneys were choked
with ivy, the large porch was blocked up with bundles of sticks, and
half the windows were closed with gray worm-eaten shutters about which
the jasmine-boughs grew in wild luxuriance; the mouldering garden wall
with hollyhocks peeping over it was a perfect study of highly mingled
subdued color, and there was an aged goat -LRB-kept doubtless on
interesting superstitious grounds-RRB- lying against the open back-kitchen
door. The mossy thatch of the cow-shed, the broken gray barn-doors,
the pauper laborers in ragged breeches who had nearly finished
unloading a wagon of corn into the barn ready for early thrashing; the
scanty dairy of cows being tethered for milking and leaving one half of
the shed in brown emptiness; the very pigs and white ducks seeming to
wander about the uneven neglected yard as if in low spirits from
feeding on a too meagre quality of rinsings,--all these objects under
the quiet light of a sky marbled with high clouds would have made a
sort of picture which we have all paused over as a <div class="bookquote">``charming bit,''
 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>touching other sensibilities than those which are stirred by the
depression of the agricultural interest, with the sad lack of farming
capital, as seen constantly in the newspapers of that time. But these
troublesome associations were just now strongly present to Mr. Brooke,
and spoiled the scene for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). Mr. Dagley himself made a figure in the
landscape, carrying a pitchfork and wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) milking-hat--a very old
beaver flattened in front. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) coat and breeches were the best he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) had,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) would not have been wearing them on this weekday occasion if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>)
had not been to market and returned later than usual, having given
himself the rare treat of dining at the public table of the Blue Bull.
How he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) came to fall into this extravagance would perhaps be matter of
wonderment to himself on the morrow; but before dinner something in the
state of the country, a slight pause in the harvest before the Far Dips
were cut, the stories about the new King and the numerous handbills on
the walls, had seemed to warrant a little recklessness. It was a maxim
about Middlemarch, and regarded as self-evident, that good meat should
have good drink, which last Dagley interpreted as plenty of table ale
well followed up by rum-and-water. These liquors have so far truth in
them that they were not false enough to make poor Dagley seem merry:
they only made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) discontent less tongue-tied than usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) had also
taken too much in the shape of muddy political talk, a stimulant
dangerously disturbing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) farming conservatism, which consisted in
holding that whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) was flushed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) eyes had a decidedly quarrelsome stare as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>)
stood still grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) pitchfork, while the landlord approached with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) easy shuffling walk, one hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) trouser-pocket and the other
swinging round a thin walking-stick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dagley, my good fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Brooke, conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was going
to be very friendly about the boy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, ay, I'm a good feller, am I? Thank ye, sir, thank ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div>said
Dagley, with a loud snarling irony which made Fag the sheep-dog stir
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) seat and prick his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) ears; but seeing Monk enter the yard after
some outside loitering, Fag seated himself again in an attitude of
observation. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad to hear I'm a good feller.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke reflected that it was market-day, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) worthy tenant
had probably been dining, but saw no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) should not go on,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could take the precaution of repeating what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had to say to
Mrs. Dagley.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your little lad Jacob has been caught killing a leveret, Dagley: I
have told Johnson to lock him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) up in the empty stable an hour or two,
just to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>), you know. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) will be brought home by-and-by,
before night: and you'll just look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>), will you, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) a
reprimand, you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I woon't: I'll be dee'd if I'll leather my boy to please you or
anybody else, not if you was twenty landlords istid o' one, and that a
bad un.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div><p/>Dagley's words were loud enough to summon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) wife to the back-kitchen
door--the only entrance ever used, and one always open except in bad
weather--and Mr. Brooke, saying soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I'll speak to
your wife--I didn't mean beating, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>turned to walk to the
house. But Dagley, only the more inclined to <div class="bookquote">``have his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) say''  (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div>with a
gentleman who walked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>), followed at once, with Fag
slouching at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) heels and sullenly evading some small and probably
charitable advances on the part of Monk.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs. Dagley?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, making some haste. <div class="bookquote">``I
came to tell you about your boy: I don't want you to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the
stick, you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was careful to speak quite plainly this time.

<p/>Overworked Mrs. Dagley--a thin, worn woman, from whose life pleasure
had so entirely vanished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) had not even any Sunday clothes which
could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) satisfaction in preparing for church--had already had a
misunderstanding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) husband since he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come home, and was in
low spirits, expecting the worst. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) husband was beforehand in
answering.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nor he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) woon't hev the stick, whether you want it or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div>pursued
Dagley, throwing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) voice, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) wanted it to hit hard.
<div class="bookquote">``You've got no call to come an' talk about sticks o' these primises, as
you woon't give a stick tow`rt mending. Go to Middlemarch to ax for
_your_ charrickter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd far better hold your tongue, Dagley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife, <div class="bookquote">``and not
kick your own trough over. When a man as is father of a family has
been an' spent money at market and made himself the worse for liquor,
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s done enough mischief for one day. But I should like to know what
my boy's done, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Niver do you mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div>said Dagley, more fiercely, <div class="bookquote">``it's
my business to speak, an' not yourn. An' I wull speak, too. I'll hev
my say--supper or no. An' what I say is, as I've lived upo' your
ground from my father and grandfather afore me, an' hev dropped our
money into`t, an' me an' my children might lie an' rot on the ground
for top-dressin' as we can't find the money to buy, if the King wasn't
to put a stop.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My good fellow, you're drunk, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,
confidentially but not judiciously. <div class="bookquote">``Another day, another day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>)
added, turning as if to go.

<p/>But Dagley immediately fronted him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>), and Fag at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) heels growled low,
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) master's voice grew louder and more insulting, while Monk also
drew close in silent dignified watch. The laborers on the wagon were
pausing to listen, and it seemed wiser to be quite passive than to
attempt a ridiculous flight pursued by a bawling man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm no more drunk nor you are, nor so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dagley/Mr. Dagley</b></font>)</div>said Dagley. ``I can
carry my liquor, an' I know what I meean. An' I meean as the King `ull
put a stop to `t, for them say it as knows it, as there's to be a
Rinform, and them landlords as never done the right thing by their
tenants `ull be treated i' that way as they'll hev to scuttle off. An'
there's them i' Middlemarch knows what the Rinform is--an' as knows
who'll hev to scuttle. Says they, ``I know who _your_ landlord is.''
An' says I, ``I hope you're the better for knowin' him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), I arn<div class="bookquote">``t.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Says
they, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)'s a close-fisted un.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay ay,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says I. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)'s a man for the
Rinform,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>says they. That's what they says. An' I made out what the
Rinform were--an' it were to send you an' your likes a-scuttlin' an'
wi' pretty strong-smellin' things too. An' you may do as you like now,
for I'm none afeard on you. An' you'd better let my boy aloan, an'
look to yoursen, afore the Rinform has got upo' your back. That's what
I'n got to say,'' concluded Mr. Dagley, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) fork into the
ground with a firmness which proved inconvenient as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) tried to draw it
up again.

<p/>At this last action Monk began to bark loudly, and it was a moment for
Mr. Brooke to escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) walked out of the yard as quickly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
could, in some amazement at the novelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) situation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had never
been insulted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own land before, and had been inclined to regard
himself as a general favorite -LRB-we are all apt to do so, when we think
of our own amiability more than of what other people are likely to want
of us-RRB-. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had quarrelled with Caleb Garth twelve years before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
had thought that the tenants would be pleased at the landlord's taking
everything into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own hands.

<p/>Some who follow the narrative of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) experience may wonder at the
midnight darkness of Mr. Dagley; but nothing was easier in those times
than for an hereditary farmer of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) grade to be ignorant, in spite
somehow of having a rector in the twin parish who was a gentleman to
the backbone, a curate nearer at hand who preached more learnedly than
the rector, a landlord who had gone into everything, especially fine
art and social improvement, and all the lights of Middlemarch only
three miles off. As to the facility with which mortals escape
knowledge, try an average acquaintance in the intellectual blaze of
London, and consider what that eligible person for a dinner-party would
have been if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had learned scant skill in <div class="bookquote">``summing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from the
parish-clerk of Tipton, and read a chapter in the Bible with immense
difficulty, because such names as Isaiah or Apollos remained
unmanageable after twice spelling. Poor Dagley read a few verses
sometimes on a Sunday evening, and the world was at least not darker to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) than it had been before. Some things he (<font color='blue'><b>Dagley</b></font>) knew thoroughly, namely,
the slovenly habits of farming, and the awkwardness of weather, stock
and crops, at Freeman's End--so called apparently by way of sarcasm,
to imply that a man was free to quit it if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose, but that there was
no earthly <div class="bookquote">``beyond''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>open to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER XL.

<p/>Wise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) daily work was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>):
To fruits of diligence,
And not to faiths or polity,
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) plied his (<font color='blue'><b>Wise</b></font>) utmost sense.
These perfect in their little parts,
Whose work is all their prize--
Without them how could laws, or arts,
Or towered cities rise?


<p/>In watching effects, if only of an electric battery, it is often
necessary to change our place and examine a particular mixture or group
at some distance from the point where the movement we are interested in
was set up. The group I am moving towards is at Caleb Garth's
breakfast-table in the large parlor where the maps and desk were:
father, mother, and five of the children. Mary was just now at home
waiting for a situation, while Christy, the boy next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>), was
getting cheap learning and cheap fare in Scotland, having to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
father's disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling
<div class="bookquote">``business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>The letters had come--nine costly letters, for which the postman had
been paid three and twopence, and Mr. Garth was forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) tea and
toast while he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) letters and laid them open one above the other,
sometimes swaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) head slowly, sometimes screwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) mouth in
inward debate, but not forgetting to cut off a large red seal unbroken,
which Letty snatched up like an eager terrier.

<p/>The talk among the rest went on unrestrainedly, for nothing disturbed
Caleb's absorption except shaking the table when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was writing.

<p/>Two letters of the nine had been for Mary. After reading them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
passed them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother, and sat playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tea-spoon absently,
till with a sudden recollection she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sewing, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had kept on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lap during breakfast.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't sew, Mary!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm down. <div class="bookquote">``Make me a
peacock with this bread-crumb.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) had been kneading a small mass for
the purpose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Mischief!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, good-humoredly, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pricked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>)
hand lightly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) needle. <div class="bookquote">``Try and mould it yourself: you have
seen me do it often enough. I must get this sewing done. It is for
Rosamond Vincy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) is to be married next week, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) can't be
married without this handkerchief.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary ended merrily, amused with
the last notion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can't she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said Letty, seriously interested in this
mystery, and pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) head so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) sister that Mary now
turned the threatening needle towards Letty's nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because this is one of a dozen, and without it there would only be
eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with a grave air of explanation, so that Letty sank
back with a sense of knowledge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you made up your mind, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, laying the
letters down.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go to the school at York,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I am less unfit to
teach in a school than in a family. I like to teach classes best.
And, you see, I must teach: there is nothing else to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Teaching seems to me the most delightful work in the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Garth, with a touch of rebuke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``I could understand your
objection to it if you had not knowledge enough, Mary, or if you
disliked children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like,
mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, rather curtly. <div class="bookquote">``I am not fond of a schoolroom: I
like the outside world better. It is a very inconvenient fault of
mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be very stupid to be always in a girls' school,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred.
<div class="bookquote">``Such a set of nincompoops, like Mrs. Ballard's pupils walking two and
two.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And they have no games worth playing at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim</b></font>)</div>said Jim. <div class="bookquote">``They can neither
throw nor leap. I don't wonder at Mary's not liking it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is that Mary doesn't like, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
spectacles and pausing before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) next letter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Being among a lot of nincompoop girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it the situation you had heard of, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, gently,
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) daughter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father: the school at York. I have determined to take it. It is
quite the best. Thirty-five pounds a-year, and extra pay for teaching
the smallest strummers at the piano.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor child! I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could stay at home with us, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said
Caleb, looking plaintively at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary would not be happy without doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth,
magisterially, conscious of having done her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It wouldn't make me happy to do such a nasty duty as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said
Alfred--at which Mary and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father laughed silently, but Mrs. Garth
said, gravely--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do find a fitter word than nasty, my dear Alfred, for everything that
you think disagreeable. And suppose that Mary could help you to go to
Mr. Hanmer's with the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That seems to me a great shame. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s an old brick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred,
rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) chair, and pulling Mary's head backward to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>Mary colored and laughed, but could not conceal that the tears were
coming. Caleb, looking on over his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spectacles, with the angles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
eyebrows falling, had an expression of mingled delight and sorrow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
returned to the opening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) letter; and even Mrs. Garth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) lips
curling with a calm contentment, allowed that inappropriate language to
pass without correction, although Ben immediately took it up, and sang,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s an old brick, old brick, old brick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>to a cantering measure,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) beat out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) fist on Mary's arm.

<p/>But Mrs. Garth's eyes were now drawn towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, who was
already deep in the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was reading. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face had an expression
of grave surprise, which alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a little, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not like to
be questioned while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was reading, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) remained anxiously watching
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suddenly shaken by a little joyous laugh as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) turned
back to the beginning of the letter, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) above his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
spectacles, said, in a low tone, <div class="bookquote">``What do you think, Susan?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went and stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder, while
they read the letter together. It was from Sir James Chettam, offering
to Mr. Garth the management of the family estates at Freshitt and
elsewhere, and adding that Sir James had been requested by Mr. Brooke
of Tipton to ascertain whether Mr. Garth would be disposed at the same
time to resume the agency of the Tipton property. The Baronet added in
very obliging words that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) himself was particularly desirous of seeing
the Freshitt and Tipton estates under the same management, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) hoped
to be able to show that the double agency might be held on terms
agreeable to Mr. Garth, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would be glad to see at the Hall at
twelve o'clock on the following day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Hanmer</b></font>) writes handsomely, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Hanmer</b></font>), Susan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) eyes
upward to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife, who raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) shoulder to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) ear,
while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Brooke didn't like to ask me
himself, I can see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) continued, laughing silently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is an honor to your father, children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, looking
round at the five pair of eyes, all fixed on the parents. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is asked
to take a post again by those who dismissed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long ago. That shows
that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) work well, so that they feel the want of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like Cincinnatus--hooray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben, riding on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) chair, with a
pleasant confidence that discipline was relaxed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will they come to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said Letty, thinking of the
Mayor and Corporation in their robes.

<p/>Mrs. Garth patted Letty's head and smiled, but seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband
was gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letters and likely soon to be out of reach in that
sanctuary <div class="bookquote">``business,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder and said emphatically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, mind you ask fair pay, Caleb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, in a deep voice of assent, as if it would be
unreasonable to suppose anything else of him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It'll come to between
four and five hundred, the two together.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then with a little start of
remembrance he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mary, write and give up that school. Stay and
help your mother. I'm as pleased as Punch, now I've thought of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No manner could have been less like that of Punch triumphant than
Caleb's, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) talents did not lie in finding phrases, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was
very particular about his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) letter-writing, and regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife as a
treasury of correct language.

<p/>There was almost an uproar among the children now, and Mary held up the
cambric embroidery towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother entreatingly, that it might be
put out of reach while the boys dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) into a dance. Mrs. Garth,
in placid joy, began to put the cups and plates together, while Caleb
pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) chair from the table, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) were going to move to the
desk, still sat holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) letters in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand and looking on the
ground meditatively, stretching out the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) left hand,
according to a mute language of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) own. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a thousand pities Christy didn't take to business, Susan. I
shall want help by-and-by. And Alfred must go off to the
engineering--I've made up my mind to that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) fell into meditation and
finger-rhetoric again for a little while, and then continued: <div class="bookquote">``I shall
make Brooke have new agreements with the tenants, and I shall draw up a
rotation of crops. And I'll lay a wager we can get fine bricks out of
the clay at Bott's corner. I must look into that: it would cheapen the
repairs. It's a fine bit of work, Susan! A man without a family would
be glad to do it for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind you don't, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife, lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) finger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; but it's a fine thing to come to a man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s seen into the
nature of business: to have the chance of getting a bit of the country
into good fettle, as they say, and putting men into the right way with
their farming, and getting a bit of good contriving and solid building
done--that those who are living and those who come after will be the
better for. I'd sooner have it than a fortune. I hold it the most
honorable work that is.''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Here Caleb laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) letters, thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
fingers between the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) waistcoat, and sat upright, but
presently proceeded with some awe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) voice and moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head
slowly aside--<div class="bookquote">``It's a great gift of God, Susan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That it is, Caleb,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife, with answering fervor. <div class="bookquote">``And it
will be a blessing to your children to have had a father who did such
work: a father whose good work remains though his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name may be
forgotten.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not say any more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) then about the pay.

<p/>In the evening, when Caleb, rather tired with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) day's work, was
seated in silence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) pocket-book open on his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) knee, while Mrs.
Garth and Mary were at their sewing, and Letty in a corner was
whispering a dialogue with her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) doll, Mr. Farebrother came up the
orchard walk, dividing the bright August lights and shadows with the
tufted grass and the apple-tree boughs. We know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was fond of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) parishioners the Garths, and had thought Mary worth mentioning to
Lydgate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) used to the full the clergyman's privilege of disregarding
the Middlemarch discrimination of ranks, and always told his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mother
that Mrs. Garth was more of a lady than any matron in the town. Still,
you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) evenings at the Vincys', where the matron, though
less of a lady, presided over a well-lit drawing-room and whist. In
those days human intercourse was not determined solely by respect. But
the Vicar did heartily respect the Garths, and a visit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was no
surprise to that family. Nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) accounted for it even while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) was shaking hands, by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I come as an envoy, Mrs. Garth: I
have something to say to you and Garth on behalf of Fred Vincy. The
fact is, poor fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) continued, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) seated himself and looked
round with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) bright glance at the three who were listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),
<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has taken me into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) confidence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary's heart beat rather quickly: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wondered how far Fred's
confidence had gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We haven't seen the lad for months,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb. <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't think
what was become of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been away on a visit,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``because home was a
little too hot for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and Lydgate told his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mother that the poor
fellow must not begin to study yet. But yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came and poured
himself out to me. I am very glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did, because I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) grow
up from a youngster of fourteen, and I am so much at home in the house
that the children are like nephews and nieces to me. But it is a
difficult case to advise upon. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has asked me to come and
tell you that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is going away, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is so miserable about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
debt to you, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) inability to pay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) can't bear to come
himself even to bid you good by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) it doesn't signify a farthing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``We've had the pinch and have got over it. And now I'm going to be as
rich as a Jew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Which means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, smiling at the Vicar, <div class="bookquote">``that we are
going to have enough to bring up the boys well and to keep Mary at
home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the treasure-trove?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm going to be agent for two estates, Freshitt and Tipton; and
perhaps for a pretty little bit of land in Lowick besides: it's all the
same family connection, and employment spreads like water if it's once
set going. It makes me very happy, Mr. Farebrother'' (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>--here Caleb threw
back his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head a little, and spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) arms on the elbows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
chair--<div class="bookquote">``that I've got an opportunity again with the letting of the
land, and carrying out a notion or two with improvements. It's a most
uncommonly cramping thing, as I've often told Susan, to sit on
horseback and look over the hedges at the wrong thing, and not be able
to put your hand to it to make it right. What people do who go into
politics I can't think: it drives me almost mad to see mismanagement
over only a few hundred acres.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>It was seldom that Caleb volunteered so long a speech, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
happiness had the effect of mountain air: his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) eyes were bright, and the
words came without effort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I congratulate you heartily, Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar. <div class="bookquote">``This is the
best sort of news I could have had to carry to Fred Vincy, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) dwelt
a good deal on the injury he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had done you in causing you to part with
money--robbing you of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) said--which you wanted for other purposes.
I wish Fred were not such an idle dog; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has some very good points,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father is a little hard upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) going?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, rather coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) means to try again for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) degree, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is going up to study
before term. I have advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to do that. I don't urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to enter
the Church--on the contrary. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) will go and work so as to pass,
that will be some guarantee that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has energy and a will; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is
quite at sea; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) doesn't know what else to do. So far he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) will please
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, and I have promised in the mean time to try and reconcile
Vincy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) son's adopting some other line of life. Fred says frankly
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is not fit for a clergyman, and I would do anything I could to
hinder a man from the fatal step of choosing the wrong profession. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
quoted to me what you said, Miss Garth--do you remember it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr.
Farebrother used to say <div class="bookquote">``Mary''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>instead of <div class="bookquote">``Miss Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>but it was part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) delicacy to treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) with the more deference because, according
to Mrs. Vincy's phrase, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) worked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) bread.-RRB-

<p/>Mary felt uncomfortable, but, determined to take the matter lightly,
answered at once, <div class="bookquote">``I have said so many impertinent things to Fred--we
are such old playfellows.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You said, according to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would be one of those ridiculous
clergymen who help to make the whole clergy ridiculous. Really, that
was so cutting that I felt a little cut myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb laughed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) gets her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) tongue from you, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said, with
some enjoyment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not its flippancy, father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, quickly, fearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
mother would be displeased. <div class="bookquote">``It is rather too bad of Fred to repeat my
flippant speeches to Mr. Farebrother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was certainly a hasty speech, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, with whom
speaking evil of dignities was a high misdemeanor. <div class="bookquote">``We should not
value our Vicar the less because there was a ridiculous curate in the
next parish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's something in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) says, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, not disposed
to have Mary's sharpness undervalued. <div class="bookquote">``A bad workman of any sort makes
his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) fellows mistrusted. Things hang together,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) added, looking on
the floor and moving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) feet uneasily with a sense that words were
scantier than thoughts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, amused. <div class="bookquote">``By being contemptible we set men's
minds, to the tune of contempt. I certainly agree with Miss Garth's
view of the matter, whether I am condemned by it or not. But as to
Fred Vincy, it is only fair he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) should be excused a little: old
Featherstone's delusive behavior did help to spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>). There was
something quite diabolical in not leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) a farthing after all.
But Fred has the good taste not to dwell on that. And what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) cares
most about is having offended you, Mrs. Garth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) supposes you will
never think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been disappointed in Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, with decision.
<div class="bookquote">``But I shall be ready to think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gives me good
reason to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>At this point Mary went out of the room, taking Letty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, we must forgive young people when they're sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb,
watching Mary close the door. <div class="bookquote">``And as you say, Mr. Farebrother, there
was the very devil in that old man. Now Mary's gone out, I must tell you
a thing--it's only known to Susan and me, and you'll not tell it again.
The old scoundrel wanted Mary to burn one of the wills the very night
he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) died, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was sitting up with him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) by herself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
a sum of money that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had in the box by him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would do it. But Mary,
you understand, could do no such thing--would not be handling his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) iron
chest, and so on. Now, you see, the will he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) wanted burnt was this last,
so that if Mary had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) wanted, Fred Vincy would have had ten
thousand pounds. The old man did turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the last. That touches
poor Mary close; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) couldn't help it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was in the right to do what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feels, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says, much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had knocked down
somebody's property and broken it against her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
rightfully defending herself. I feel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), somehow, and if I could
make any amends to the poor lad, instead of bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a grudge for
the harm he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) did us, I should be glad to do it. Now, what is your opinion,
sir? Susan doesn't agree with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) says--tell what you say, Susan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary could not have acted otherwise, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known what would
be the effect on Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, pausing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) work, and
looking at Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite ignorant of it. It seems to me, a loss which falls
on another because we have done right is not to lie upon our
conscience.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>The Vicar did not answer immediately, and Caleb said, <div class="bookquote">``It's the
feeling. The child feels in that way, and I feel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). You don't
mean your horse to tread on a dog when you're backing out of the way;
but it goes through you, when it's done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure Mrs. Garth would agree with you there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Farebrother, who for some reason seemed more inclined to ruminate than
to speak. <div class="bookquote">``One could hardly say that the feeling you mention about
Fred is wrong--or rather, mistaken--though no man ought to make a claim
on such feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, <div class="bookquote">``it's a secret. You will not tell Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not. But I shall carry the other good news--that you can
afford the loss he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) caused you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the
orchard with Letty, went to say good-by to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). They made a pretty
picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the
apples on the old scant-leaved boughs--Mary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lavender gingham and
black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) well-worn nankin
picked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how
Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded
street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will not be among
those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out
necks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix
your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet
carriage, who looks about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but does not suppose that anybody is
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has a broad face and square brow, well-marked
eyebrows and curly dark hair, a certain expression of amusement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
glance which her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mouth keeps the secret of, and for the rest features
entirely insignificant--take that ordinary but not disagreeable person
for a portrait of Mary Garth. If you made her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would show
you perfect little teeth; if you made her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) angry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would not raise
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) voice, but would probably say one of the bitterest things you have
ever tasted the flavor of; if you did her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) a kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would never
forget it. Mary admired the keen-faced handsome little Vicar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
well-brushed threadbare clothes more than any man she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had the
opportunity of knowing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) say a foolish thing,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) did unwise ones; and perhaps foolish sayings
were more objectionable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) than any of Mr. Farebrother's unwise
doings. At least, it was remarkable that the actual imperfections of
the Vicar's clerical character never seemed to call forth the same
scorn and dislike which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) showed beforehand for the predicted
imperfections of the clerical character sustained by Fred Vincy. These
irregularities of judgment, I imagine, are found even in riper minds
than Mary Garth's: our impartiality is kept for abstract merit and
demerit, which none of us ever saw. Will any one guess towards which
of those widely different men Mary had the peculiar woman's
tenderness?--the one she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was most inclined to be severe on, or the
contrary?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any message for your old playfellow, Miss Garth?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) took a fragrant apple from the basket which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) held
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Something to soften down that
harsh judgment? I am going straight to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, and smiling. <div class="bookquote">``If I were to say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would not be ridiculous as a clergyman, I must say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would be
something worse than ridiculous. But I am very glad to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is
going away to work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that _you_ are not going
away to work. My mother, I am sure, will be all the happier if you
will come to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at the vicarage: you know she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is fond of having
young people to talk to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has a great deal to tell about old
times. You will really be doing a kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much, if I may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``Everything seems
too happy for me all at once. I thought it would always be part of my
life to long for home, and losing that grievance makes me feel rather
empty: I suppose it served instead of sense to fill up my mind?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go with you, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>whispered Letty--a most inconvenient child,
who listened to everything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was made exultant by having her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
chin pinched and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cheek kissed by Mr. Farebrother--an incident
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) narrated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother and father.

<p/>As the Vicar walked to Lowick, any one watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) closely might have
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) twice shrug his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) shoulders. I think that the rare Englishmen
who have this gesture are never of the heavy type--for fear of any
lumbering instance to the contrary, I will say, hardly ever; they have
usually a fine temperament and much tolerance towards the smaller
errors of men -LRB-themselves inclusive-RRB-. The Vicar was holding an inward
dialogue in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) told himself that there was probably something
more between Fred and Mary Garth than the regard of old playfellows,
and replied with a question whether that bit of womanhood were not a
great deal too choice for that crude young gentleman. The rejoinder to
this was the first shrug. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) laughed at himself for being likely
to have felt jealous, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been a man able to marry, which,
added he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), it is as clear as any balance-sheet that I am not. Whereupon
followed the second shrug.

<p/>What could two men, so different from each other, see in this <div class="bookquote">``brown
patch,''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>as Mary called herself? It was certainly not her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) plainness
that attracted them -LRB-and let all plain young ladies be warned against
the dangerous encouragement given them by Society to confide in their
want of beauty-RRB-. A human being in this aged nation of ours is a very
wonderful whole, the slow creation of long interchanging influences:
and charm is a result of two such wholes, the one loving and the one
loved.

<p/>When Mr. and Mrs. Garth were sitting alone, Caleb said, <div class="bookquote">``Susan, guess
what I'm thinking of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The rotation of crops,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), above her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, gravely; <div class="bookquote">``I am thinking that I could do a great turn
for Fred Vincy. Christy's gone, Alfred will be gone soon, and it will
be five years before Jim is ready to take to business. I shall want
help, and Fred might come in and learn the nature of things and act
under me, and it might be the making of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) into a useful man, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
gives up being a parson. What do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, there is hardly anything honest that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) family would object
to more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, decidedly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What care I about their objecting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with a sturdiness
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was apt to show when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had an opinion. <div class="bookquote">``The lad is of age
and must get his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bread. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has sense enough and quickness enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)
likes being on the land, and it's my belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could learn
business well if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But would he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) father and mother wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to be a fine

all think us beneath them. And if the proposal came from you, I am
sure Mrs. Vincy would say that we wanted Fred for Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Life is a poor tale, if it is to be settled by nonsense of that sort,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with disgust.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I call it improper pride to let fools' notions hinder you from doing a
good action. There's no sort of work,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with fervor,
putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand and moving it up and down to mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) emphasis,
<div class="bookquote">``that could ever be done well, if you minded what fools say. You must

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not oppose any plan you have set your mind on, Caleb,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Garth, who was a firm woman, but knew that there were some points

that Fred is to go back to college: will it not be better to wait and

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it may be better to wait a bit. But as to my getting plenty of
work for two, I'm pretty sure of that. I've always had my hands full

odd that two men should have been at me on different sides to do the

taking a pinch of snuff and holding it up between his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) fingers, as if it
were a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) exposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was fond of a pinch when it occurred
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) usually forgot that this indulgence was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) command.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife held down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knitting and looked attentive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that Rigg, or Rigg Featherstone, was one. But Bulstrode was
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), so I'm going to do it for Bulstrode. Whether it's mortgage

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb scattered his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) snuff carefully instead of taking it, and then
added, <div class="bookquote">``The ins and outs of things are curious. Here is the land

which he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) associated with various points of view or states of mind; and
whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had a feeling of awe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was haunted by a sense of Biblical
phraseology, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could hardly have given a strict quotation.



<p/>CHAPTER XLI.

<p/>``By swaggering could I never thrive,
For the rain it raineth every day.
--Twelfth Night


<p/>The transactions referred to by Caleb Garth as having gone forward
between Mr. Bulstrode and Mr. Joshua Rigg Featherstone concerning the
land attached to Stone Court, had occasioned the interchange of a
letter or two between these personages.

<p/>Who shall tell what may be the effect of writing? If it happens to
have been cut in stone, though it lie face down-most for ages on a
forsaken beach, or <div class="bookquote">``rest quietly under the drums and tramplings of many
conquests,''  (<font color='red'><b>ages rest</b></font>)</div>it may end by letting us into the secret of usurpations and
other scandals gossiped about long empires ago:--this world being
apparently a huge whispering-gallery. Such conditions are often
minutely represented in our petty lifetimes. As the stone which has
been kicked by generations of clowns may come by curious little links
of effect under the eyes of a scholar, through whose labors it may at
last fix the date of invasions and unlock religions, so a bit of ink
and paper which has long been an innocent wrapping or stop-gap may at
last be laid open under the one pair of eyes which have knowledge
enough to turn it into the opening of a catastrophe. To Uriel watching
the progress of planetary history from the sun, the one result would be
just as much of a coincidence as the other.

<p/>Having made this rather lofty comparison I am less uneasy in calling
attention to the existence of low people by whose interference, however
little we may like it, the course of the world is very much determined.
It would be well, certainly, if we could help to reduce their number,
and something might perhaps be done by not lightly giving occasion to
their existence. Socially speaking, Joshua Rigg would have been
generally pronounced a superfluity. But those who like Peter
Featherstone never had a copy of themselves demanded, are the very last
to wait for such a request either in prose or verse. The copy in this
case bore more of outside resemblance to the mother, in whose sex
frog-features, accompanied with fresh-colored cheeks and a well-rounded
figure, are compatible with much charm for a certain order of admirers.
The result is sometimes a frog-faced male, desirable, surely, to no
order of intelligent beings. Especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>male</b></font>) is suddenly brought
into evidence to frustrate other people's expectations--the very
lowest aspect in which a social superfluity can present himself.

<p/>But Mr. Rigg Featherstone's low characteristics were all of the sober,
water-drinking kind. From the earliest to the latest hour of the day
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) was always as sleek, neat, and cool as the frog he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) resembled, and
old Peter had secretly chuckled over an offshoot almost more
calculating, and far more imperturbable, than himself. I will add that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) finger-nails were scrupulously attended to, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) meant to
marry a well-educated young lady -LRB-as yet unspecified-RRB- whose person was
good, and whose connections, in a solid middle-class way, were
undeniable. Thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) nails and modesty were comparable to those of
most gentlemen; though his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) ambition had been educated only by the
opportunities of a clerk and accountant in the smaller commercial
houses of a seaport. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) thought the rural Featherstones very simple
absurd people, and they in their turn regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``bringing up''  (<font color='red'><b>Featherstones people</b></font>)</div>in a
seaport town as an exaggeration of the monstrosity that their brother
Peter, and still more Peter's property, should have had such belongings.

<p/>The garden and gravel approach, as seen from the two windows of the
wainscoted parlor at Stone Court, were never in better trim than now,
when Mr. Rigg Featherstone stood, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), looking
out on these grounds as their master. But it seemed doubtful whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) looked out for the sake of contemplation or of turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) back to a
person who stood in the middle of the room, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) legs considerably
apart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) trouser-pockets: a person in all respects a
contrast to the sleek and cool Rigg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) was a man obviously on the way
towards sixty, very florid and hairy, with much gray in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) bushy
whiskers and thick curly hair, a stoutish body which showed to
disadvantage the somewhat worn joinings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) clothes, and the air of
a swaggerer, who would aim at being noticeable even at a show of
fireworks, regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) own remarks on any other person's performance
as likely to be more interesting than the performance itself.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) name was John Raffles, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) sometimes wrote jocosely W.A.G.
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) signature, observing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) did so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) was once taught
by Leonard Lamb of Finsbury who wrote B.A. after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) name, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>),
Raffles, originated the witticism of calling that celebrated principal
Ba-Lamb. Such were the appearance and mental flavor of Mr. Raffles,
both of which seemed to have a stale odor of travellers' rooms in the
commercial hotels of that period.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, Josh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was saying, in a full rumbling tone, <div class="bookquote">``look at it
in this light: here is your poor mother going into the vale of years,
and you could afford something handsome now to make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not while you live. Nothing would make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) comfortable while you
live,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rigg/Mr. Rigg/Mr. Rigg Featherstone</b></font>)</div>returned Rigg, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) cool high voice. <div class="bookquote">``What I give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), you'll
take.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You bear me a grudge, Josh, that I know. But come, now--as between
man and man--without humbug--a little capital might enable me to make a
first-rate thing of the shop. The tobacco trade is growing. I should
cut my own nose off in not doing the best I could at it. I should
stick to it like a flea to a fleece for my own sake. I should always
be on the spot. And nothing would make your poor mother so happy.
I've pretty well done with my wild oats--turned fifty-five. I want to
settle down in my chimney-corner. And if I once buckled to the tobacco
trade, I could bring an amount of brains and experience to bear on it
that would not be found elsewhere in a hurry. I don't want to be
bothering you one time after another, but to get things once for all
into the right channel. Consider that, Josh--as between man and
man--and with your poor mother to be made easy for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life. I was
always fond of the old woman, by Jove!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you done?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rigg/Mr. Rigg/Mr. Rigg Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rigg, quietly, without looking away from the
window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I've done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) hat which stood
before him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) on the table, and giving it a sort of oratorical push.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then just listen to me. The more you say anything, the less I shall
believe it. The more you want me to do a thing, the more reason I

me and my mother? Do you think I forget your always coming home to

 (<font color='red'><b>Rigg/Mr. Rigg/Mr. Rigg Featherstone</b></font>)</div><p/>As Rigg pronounced the last words he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) turned round and looked at Raffles
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) prominent frozen eyes. The contrast was as striking as it
could have been eighteen years before, when Rigg was a most unengaging
kickable boy, and Raffles was the rather thick-set Adonis of bar-rooms
and back-parlors. But the advantage now was on the side of Rigg, and
auditors of this conversation might probably have expected that Raffles
would retire with the air of a defeated dog. Not at all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) made a
grimace which was habitual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``out''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a game;
then subsided into a laugh, and drew a brandy-flask from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) pocket.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Josh,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) said, in a cajoling tone, <div class="bookquote">``give us a spoonful of
brandy, and a sovereign to pay the way back, and I'll go. Honor
bright! I'll go like a bullet, _by_ Jove!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rigg/Mr. Rigg/Mr. Rigg Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Rigg, drawing out a bunch of keys, <div class="bookquote">``if I ever see you
again, I shan't speak to you. I don't own you any more than if I saw a
crow; and if you want to own me you'll get nothing by it but a
character for being what you are--a spiteful, brassy, bullying rogue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rigg/Mr. Rigg/Mr. Rigg Featherstone</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a pity, now, Josh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, affecting to scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) head
and wrinkle his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) brows upward as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) were nonplussed. <div class="bookquote">``I'm very fond
of you; _by_ Jove, I am! There's nothing I like better than plaguing
you--you're so like your mother, and I must do without it. But the
brandy and the sovereign's a bargain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) jerked forward the flask and Rigg went to a fine old oaken bureau
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) keys. But Raffles had reminded himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) movement with
the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather
covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within
the fender, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) took it up and shoved it under the leather so as to make
the glass firm.

<p/>By that time Rigg came forward with a brandy-bottle, filled the flask,
and handed Raffles a sovereign, neither looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) nor speaking to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>). After locking up the bureau again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) walked to the window and
gazed out as impassibly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had done at the beginning of the
interview, while Raffles took a small allowance from the flask, screwed
it up, and deposited it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) side-pocket, with provoking slowness,
making a grimace at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) stepson's back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farewell, Josh--and if forever!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, turning back his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) head
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/>Rigg saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) leave the grounds and enter the lane. The gray day had
turned to a light drizzling rain, which freshened the hedgerows and the
grassy borders of the by-roads, and hastened the laborers who were
loading the last shocks of corn. Raffles, walking with the uneasy gait
of a town loiterer obliged to do a bit of country journeying on foot,
looked as incongruous amid this moist rural quiet and industry as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
had been a baboon escaped from a menagerie. But there were none to
stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) except the long-weaned calves, and none to show dislike of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) appearance except the little water-rats which rustled away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
approach.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was fortunate enough when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) got on to the highroad to be overtaken
by the stage-coach, which carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to Brassing; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) took
the new-made railway, observing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) fellow-passengers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
considered it pretty well seasoned now it had done for Huskisson. Mr.
Raffles on most occasions kept up the sense of having been educated at
an academy, and being able, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) chose, to pass well everywhere;
indeed, there was not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) fellow-men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) did not feel
himself in a position to ridicule and torment, confident of the
entertainment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) thus gave to all the rest of the company.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) played this part now with as much spirit as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) journey had been
entirely successful, resorting at frequent intervals to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) flask. The
paper with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had wedged it was a letter signed Nicholas
Bulstrode, but Raffles was not likely to disturb it from its present
useful position.



<p/>CHAPTER XLII.

<p/>``How much, methinks, I could despise this man
Were I not bound in charity against it!
--SHAKESPEARE: Henry VIII.


<p/>One of the professional calls made by Lydgate soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) return
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wedding-journey was to Lowick Manor, in consequence of a
letter which had requested him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to fix a time for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) visit.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon had never put any question concerning the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
illness to Lydgate, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) even to Dorothea betrayed any anxiety as
to how far it might be likely to cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) labors or his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) life. On
this point, as on all others, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) shrank from pity; and if the suspicion
of being pitied for anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) lot surmised or known in spite of
himself was embittering, the idea of calling forth a show of compassion
by frankly admitting an alarm or a sorrow was necessarily intolerable
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Every proud mind knows something of this experience, and
perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough
to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of
exalting.

<p/>But Mr. Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the
question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) health and life haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) silence with a more
harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
authorship. It is true that this last might be called his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) central
ambition; but there are some kinds of authorship in which by far the
largest result is the uneasy susceptibility accumulated in the
consciousness of the author--one knows of the river by a few streaks
amid a long-gathered deposit of uncomfortable mud. That was the way
with Mr. Casaubon's hard intellectual labors. Their most
characteristic result was not the <div class="bookquote">``Key to all Mythologies,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>but a
morbid consciousness that others did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) the place which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
had not demonstrably merited--a perpetual suspicious conjecture that
the views entertained of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) were not to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) advantage--a melancholy
absence of passion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) efforts at achievement, and a passionate
resistance to the confession that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had achieved nothing.

<p/>Thus his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) intellectual ambition which seemed to others to have absorbed
and dried him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), was really no security against wounds, least of all
against those which came from Dorothea. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had begun now to frame
possibilities for the future which were somehow more embittering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
than anything his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) mind had dwelt on before.

<p/>Against certain facts he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was helpless: against Will Ladislaw's
existence, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) defiant stay in the neighborhood of Lowick, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
flippant state of mind with regard to the possessors of authentic,
well-stamped erudition: against Dorothea's nature, always taking on
some new shape of ardent activity, and even in submission and silence
covering fervid reasons which it was an irritation to think of: against
certain notions and likings which had taken possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind in
relation to subjects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) could not possibly discuss with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).
There was no denying that Dorothea was as virtuous and lovely a young
lady as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) could have obtained for a wife; but a young lady turned out
to be something more troublesome than he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had conceived. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nursed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anticipated his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) wants, and was solicitous
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) feelings; but there had entered into the husband's mind the
certainty that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wifely devotedness was like
a penitential expiation of unbelieving thoughts--was accompanied with a
power of comparison by which himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) doings were seen too
luminously as a part of things in general. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) discontent passed
vapor-like through all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gentle loving manifestations, and clung to
that inappreciative world which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had only brought nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Mr. Casaubon! This suffering was the harder to bear because it
seemed like a betrayal: the young creature who had worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) with
perfect trust had quickly turned into the critical wife; and early
instances of criticism and resentment had made an impression which no
tenderness and submission afterwards could remove. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suspicious
interpretation Dorothea's silence now was a suppressed rebellion; a
remark from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not in any way anticipated was an
assertion of conscious superiority; her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gentle answers had an
irritating cautiousness in them; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) acquiesced it was a
self-approved effort of forbearance. The tenacity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) strove
to hide this inward drama made it the more vivid for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); as we hear
with the more keenness what we wish others not to hear.

<p/>Instead of wondering at this result of misery in Mr. Casaubon, I think
it quite ordinary. Will not a tiny speck very close to our vision blot
out the glory of the world, and leave only a margin by which we see the
blot? I know no speck so troublesome as self. And who, if Mr.
Casaubon had chosen to expound his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) discontents--his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suspicions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
was not any longer adored without criticism--could have denied that
they were founded on good reasons? On the contrary, there was a strong
reason to be added, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not himself taken explicitly into
account--namely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was not unmixedly adorable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suspected
this, however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suspected other things, without confessing it, and
like the rest of us, felt how soothing it would have been to have a
companion who would never find it out.

<p/>This sore susceptibility in relation to Dorothea was thoroughly
prepared before Will Ladislaw had returned to Lowick, and what had
occurred since then had brought Mr. Casaubon's power of suspicious
construction into exasperated activity. To all the facts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) added imaginary facts both present and future which became
more real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) than those because they called up a stronger dislike,
a more predominating bitterness. Suspicion and jealousy of Will
Ladislaw's intentions, suspicion and jealousy of Dorothea's
impressions, were constantly at their weaving work. It would be quite
unjust to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) could have entered into any coarse
misinterpretation of Dorothea: his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own habits of mind and conduct,
quite as much as the open elevation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) nature, saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) from any
such mistake. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was jealous of was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) opinion, the sway that
might be given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ardent mind in its judgments, and the future
possibilities to which these might lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). As to Will, though until
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) last defiant letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had nothing definite which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would choose
formally to allege against him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt himself warranted in believing
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was capable of any design which could fascinate a rebellious
temper and an undisciplined impulsiveness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was quite sure that
Dorothea was the cause of Will's return from Rome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
determination to settle in the neighborhood; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was penetrating
enough to imagine that Dorothea had innocently encouraged this course.
It was as clear as possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was ready to be attached to Will
and to be pliant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) suggestions: they had never had a tete-a-tete
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bringing away from it some new troublesome impression, and
the last interview that Mr. Casaubon was aware of -LRB-Dorothea, on
returning from Freshitt Hall, had for the first time been silent about
having seen Will-RRB- had led to a scene which roused an angrier feeling
against them both than he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had ever known before. Dorothea's outpouring
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) notions about money, in the darkness of the night, had done
nothing but bring a mixture of more odious foreboding into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's mind.

<p/>And there was the shock lately given to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) health always sadly present
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was certainly much revived; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had recovered all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
usual power of work: the illness might have been mere fatigue, and
there might still be twenty years of achievement before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), which
would justify the thirty years of preparation. That prospect was made
the sweeter by a flavor of vengeance against the hasty sneers of Carp &
Company; for even when Mr. Casaubon was carrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) taper among the
tombs of the past, those modern figures came athwart the dim light, and
interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) diligent exploration. To convince Carp of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mistake,
so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own words with a good deal of
indigestion, would be an agreeable accident of triumphant authorship,
which the prospect of living to future ages on earth and to all
eternity in heaven could not exclude from contemplation. Since, thus,
the prevision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own unending bliss could not nullify the bitter
savors of irritated jealousy and vindictiveness, it is the less
surprising that the probability of a transient earthly bliss for other
persons, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) himself should have entered into glory, had not a
potently sweetening effect. If the truth should be that some
undermining disease was at work within him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), there might be large
opportunity for some people to be the happier when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was gone; and if
one of those people should be Will Ladislaw, Mr. Casaubon objected so
strongly that it seemed as if the annoyance would make part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
disembodied existence.

<p/>This is a very bare and therefore a very incomplete way of putting the
case. The human soul moves in many channels, and Mr. Casaubon, we
know, had a sense of rectitude and an honorable pride in satisfying the
requirements of honor, which compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to find other reasons for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) conduct than those of jealousy and vindictiveness. The way in
which Mr. Casaubon put the case was this:--<div class="bookquote">``In marrying Dorothea Brooke
I had to care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) well-being in case of my death. But well-being
is not to be secured by ample, independent possession of property; on
the contrary, occasions might arise in which such possession might
expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) to the more danger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) is ready prey to any man who knows
how to play adroitly either on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) affectionate ardor or her (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) Quixotic
enthusiasm; and a man stands by with that very intention in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind--a
man with no other principle than transient caprice, and who has a
personal animosity towards me--I am sure of it--an animosity which is
fed by the consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ingratitude, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has
constantly vented in ridicule of which I am as well assured as if I had
heard it. Even if I live I shall not be without uneasiness as to what
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may attempt through indirect influence. This man has gained
Dorothea's ear: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fascinated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) attention; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has evidently tried
to impress her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind with the notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has claims beyond anything
I have done for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If I die--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is waiting here on the watch for
that--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That would be calamity for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and success for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). _She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)_ would not think it calamity: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) believe anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has a tendency to immoderate attachment
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inwardly reproaches me for not responding to, and already her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
mind is occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortunes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks of an easy conquest and
of entering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a marriage would be
fatal to Dorothea. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever persisted in anything except from
contradiction? In knowledge he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has always tried to be showy at small
cost. In religion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be, as long as it suited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the facile
echo of Dorothea's vagaries. When was sciolism ever dissociated from
laxity? I utterly distrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morals, and it is my duty to hinder to
the utmost the fulfilment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) designs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) marriage left strong
measures open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), but in ruminating on them his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind inevitably
dwelt so much on the probabilities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own life that the longing to
get the nearest possible calculation had at last overcome his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) proud
reticence, and had determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to ask Lydgate's opinion as to the
nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) illness.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate was coming by appointment at
half-past three, and in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anxious question, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
felt ill, replied,--<div class="bookquote">``No, I merely wish to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion concerning
some habitual symptoms. You need not see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), my dear. I shall give
orders that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be sent to me in the Yew-tree Walk, where I shall be
taking my usual exercise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When Lydgate entered the Yew-tree Walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw Mr. Casaubon slowly
receding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) habit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head
bent forward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the lofty
limes were falling silently across the sombre evergreens, while the
lights and shadows slept side by side: there was no sound but the
cawing of the rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or that
last solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious of an energetic frame
in its prime, felt some compassion when the figure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was likely
soon to overtake turned round, and in advancing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) showed more
markedly than ever the signs of premature age--the student's bent
shoulders, the emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the mouth.
<div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``some men with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) years are like lions; one
can tell nothing of their age except that they are full grown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) invariably polite air, <div class="bookquote">``I am
exceedingly obliged to you for your punctuality. We will, if you
please, carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant
symptoms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, filling up a pause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not immediately--no. In order to account for that wish I must
mention--what it were otherwise needless to refer to--that my life, on
all collateral accounts insignificant, derives a possible importance
from the incompleteness of labors which have extended through all its
best years. In short, I have long had on hand a work which I would
fain leave behind me in such a state, at least, that it might be
committed to the press by--others. Were I assured that this is the
utmost I can reasonably expect, that assurance would be a useful
circumscription of my attempts, and a guide in both the positive and
negative determination of my course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mr. Casaubon paused, removed one hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) back and thrust it
between the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) single-breasted coat. To a mind largely
instructed in the human destiny hardly anything could be more
interesting than the inward conflict implied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) formal measured
address, delivered with the usual sing-song and motion of the head.
Nay, are there many situations more sublimely tragic than the struggle
of the soul with the demand to renounce a work which has been all the
significance of its life--a significance which is to vanish as the
waters which come and go where no man has need of them? But there was
nothing to strike others as sublime about Mr. Casaubon, and Lydgate,
who had some contempt at hand for futile scholarship, felt a little
amusement mingling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was at present too ill acquainted
with disaster to enter into the pathos of a lot where everything is
below the level of tragedy except the passionate egoism of the sufferer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You refer to the possible hindrances from want of health?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) said,
wishing to help forward Mr. Casaubon's purpose, which seemed to be
clogged by some hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do. You have not implied to me that the symptoms which--I am bound
to testify--you watched with scrupulous care, were those of a fatal
disease. But were it so, Mr. Lydgate, I should desire to know the
truth without reservation, and I appeal to you for an exact statement
of your conclusions: I request it as a friendly service. If you can
tell me that my life is not threatened by anything else than ordinary
casualties, I shall rejoice, on grounds which I have already indicated.
If not, knowledge of the truth is even more important to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I can no longer hesitate as to my course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``but the
first thing I must impress on you is that my conclusions are doubly
uncertain--uncertain not only because of my fallibility, but because
diseases of the heart are eminently difficult to found predictions on.
In any case, one can hardly increase appreciably the tremendous
uncertainty of life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Casaubon winced perceptibly, but bowed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe that you are suffering from what is called fatty
degeneration of the heart, a disease which was first divined and
explored by Laennec, the man who gave us the stethoscope, not so very
many years ago. A good deal of experience--a more lengthened
observation--is wanting on the subject. But after what you have said,
it is my duty to tell you that death from this disease is often sudden.
At the same time, no such result can be predicted. Your condition may
be consistent with a tolerably comfortable life for another fifteen
years, or even more. I could add no information to this beyond
anatomical or medical details, which would leave expectation at
precisely the same point.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate's instinct was fine enough to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that plain speech, quite free from ostentatious caution, would be
felt by Mr. Casaubon as a tribute of respect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, after a moment's pause.
<div class="bookquote">``One thing more I have still to ask: did you communicate what you have
now told me to Mrs. Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly--I mean, as to the possible issues.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate was going to
explain why he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had told Dorothea, but Mr. Casaubon, with an
unmistakable desire to end the conversation, waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hand slightly,
and said again, <div class="bookquote">``I thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>proceeding to remark on the rare beauty
of the day.

<p/>Lydgate, certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) patient wished to be alone, soon left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>);
and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued
to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a mute companionship
in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted
across the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as in the presence
of a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself
looking into the eyes of death--who was passing through one of those
rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace,
which is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of
waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the
water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the
commonplace <div class="bookquote">``We must all die''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>transforms itself suddenly into the acute
consciousness <div class="bookquote">``I must die--and soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then death grapples us, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
fingers are cruel; afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may come to fold us in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms as
our mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be
like the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suddenly found
himself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming
oar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an
hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward
in imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward--perhaps
with the divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties
of self-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon's bias his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) acts will give us a
clew to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) held himself to be, with some private scholarly
reservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and
hopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call
it a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the future estate for which
men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love.
And Mr. Casaubon's immediate desire was not for divine communion and
light divested of earthly conditions; his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) passionate longings, poor
man, clung low and mist-like in very shady places.

<p/>Dorothea had been aware when Lydgate had ridden away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hesitated, fearing to offend him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by obtruding herself; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
ardor, continually repulsed, served, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) intense memory, to
heighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dread, as thwarted energy subsides into a shudder; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
wandered slowly round the nearer clumps of trees until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
advancing. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and might have represented a
heaven-sent angel coming with a promise that the short hours remaining
should yet be filled with that faithful love which clings the closer to
a comprehended grief. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glance in reply to hers was so chill that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) timidity increased; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) turned and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand
through his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arm.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pliant arm to
cling with difficulty against his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) rigid arm.

<p/>There was something horrible to Dorothea in the sensation which this
unresponsive hardness inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). That is a strong word, but not
too strong: it is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of
joy are forever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard
faces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth
bears no harvest of sweetness--calling their denial knowledge. You may
ask why, in the name of manliness, Mr. Casaubon should have behaved in
that way. Consider that his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was a mind which shrank from pity: have
you ever watched in such a mind the effect of a suspicion that what is
pressing it as a grief may be really a source of contentment, either
actual or future, to the being who already offends by pitying?
Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) knew little of Dorothea's sensations, and had not reflected
that on such an occasion as the present they were comparable in
strength to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own sensibilities about Carp's criticisms.

<p/>Dorothea did not withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arm, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not venture to speak.
Mr. Casaubon did not say, <div class="bookquote">``I wish to be alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
steps in silence towards the house, and as they entered by the glass
door on this eastern side, Dorothea withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arm and lingered on
the matting, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband quite free. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) entered
the library and shut himself in, alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sorrow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) boudoir. The open bow-window let in the serene
glory of the afternoon lying in the avenue, where the lime-trees cast
long shadows. But Dorothea knew nothing of the scene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) threw
herself on a chair, not heeding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was in the dazzling sun-rays:
if there were discomfort in that, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tell that it was not
part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inward misery?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was in the reaction of a rebellious anger stronger than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
felt since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage. Instead of tears there came words:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done--what am I--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should treat me so? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) never
knows what is in my mind--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) never cares. What is the use of anything
I do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never married me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) began to hear herself, and was checked into stillness. Like one
who has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) way and is weary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat and saw as in one glance all
the paths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) young hope which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should never find again. And
just as clearly in the miserable light she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's solitude--how they walked apart so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was obliged to
survey him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would never have
surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--never have said, <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) worth living for?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>but would have
felt him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) simply a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own life. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``It is
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fault, not mine.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In the jar of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole being, Pity was
overthrown. Was it her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fault that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--had
believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) worthiness?--And what, exactly, was he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)?-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was able
enough to estimate him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) who waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) glances with trembling,
and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) best soul in prison, paying it only hidden visits, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might be petty enough to please him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). In such a crisis as this,
some women begin to hate.

<p/>The sun was low when Dorothea was thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would not go down
again, but would send a message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not
well and preferred remaining up-stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never deliberately
allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resentment to govern her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in this way before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
believed now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again without telling him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the
truth about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could do it without
interruption. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might wonder and be hurt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) message. It was good
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should wonder and be hurt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anger said, as anger is apt to
say, that God was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--that all heaven, though it were crowded
with spirits watching them, must be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had determined to
ring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bell, when there came a rap at the door.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon had sent to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dinner in the
library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wished to be quite alone this evening, being much occupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not dine, then, Tantripp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, madam, let me bring you a little something?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I am not well. Get everything ready in my dressing room, but pray
do not disturb me again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea sat almost motionless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) meditative struggle, while the
evening slowly deepened into night. But the struggle changed
continually, as that of a man who begins with a movement towards
striking and ends with conquering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire to strike. The energy
that would animate a crime is not more than is wanted to inspire a
resolved submission, when the noble habit of the soul reasserts itself.
That thought with which Dorothea had gone out to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been asking about the possible arrest of all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
work, and that the answer must have wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart, could not be long
without rising beside the image of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), like a shadowy monitor looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anger with sad remonstrance. It cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) a litany of pictured
sorrows and of silent cries that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might be the mercy for those
sorrows--but the resolved submission did come; and when the house was
still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew that it was near the time when Mr. Casaubon
habitually went to rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) door gently and stood outside
in the darkness waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) coming up-stairs with a light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
hand. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not come soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would go down and
even risk incurring another pang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would never again expect
anything else. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did hear the library door open, and slowly the
light advanced up the staircase without noise from the footsteps on the
carpet. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband stood opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face
was more haggard. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) started slightly on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked up
at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beseechingly, without speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, with a gentle surprise in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``Were you
waiting for me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did not like to disturb you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, my dear, come. You are young, and need not to extend your life
by watching.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>When the kind quiet melancholy of that speech fell on Dorothea's ears,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt something like the thankfulness that might well up in us if we
had narrowly escaped hurting a lamed creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's, and they went along the broad corridor together.





<p/>BOOK V.





<p/>THE DEAD HAND.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIII.

<p/>This figure hath high price: 't was wrought with love
Ages ago in finest ivory;
Nought modish in it, pure and noble lines
Of generous womanhood that fits all time
That too is costly ware; majolica
Of deft design, to please a lordly eye:
The smile, you see, is perfect--wonderful
As mere Faience! a table ornament
To suit the richest mounting.''


<p/>Dorothea seldom left home without her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did occasionally
drive into Middlemarch alone, on little errands of shopping or charity
such as occur to every lady of any wealth when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lives within three
miles of a town. Two days after that scene in the Yew-tree Walk, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
determined to use such an opportunity in order if possible to see
Lydgate, and learn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) whether her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband had really felt any
depressing change of symptoms which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was concealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had insisted on knowing the utmost about himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt
almost guilty in asking for knowledge about him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) from another, but the
dread of being without it--the dread of that ignorance which would make
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) unjust or hard--overcame every scruple. That there had been some
crisis in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband's mind she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was certain: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had the very next day
begun a new method of arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) notes, and had associated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) quite
newly in carrying out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) plan. Poor Dorothea needed to lay up stores
of patience.

<p/>It was about four o'clock when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) drove to Lydgate's house in Lowick
Gate, wishing, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) immediate doubt of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had written beforehand. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, who had never, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew
of, seen Rosamond, but now remembered the fact of the marriage. Yes,
Mrs. Lydgate was at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will go in and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will allow me. Will you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) can see me--see Mrs. Casaubon, for a few minutes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div><p/>When the servant had gone to deliver that message, Dorothea could hear
sounds of music through an open window--a few notes from a man's voice
and then a piano bursting into roulades. But the roulades broke off
suddenly, and then the servant came back saying that Mrs. Lydgate would
be happy to see Mrs. Casaubon.

<p/>When the drawing-room door opened and Dorothea entered, there was a
sort of contrast not infrequent in country life when the habits of the
different ranks were less blent than now. Let those who know, tell us
exactly what stuff it was that Dorothea wore in those days of mild
autumn--that thin white woollen stuff soft to the touch and soft to the
eye. It always seemed to have been lately washed, and to smell of the
sweet hedges--was always in the shape of a pelisse with sleeves hanging
all out of the fashion. Yet if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had entered before a still audience
as Imogene or Cato's daughter, the dress might have seemed right
enough: the grace and dignity were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) limbs and neck; and about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
simply parted hair and candid eyes the large round poke which was then
in the fate of women, seemed no more odd as a head-dress than the gold
trencher we call a halo. By the present audience of two persons, no
dramatic heroine could have been expected with more interest than Mrs.
Casaubon. To Rosamond she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was one of those county divinities not
mixing with Middlemarch mortality, whose slightest marks of manner or
appearance were worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) study; moreover, Rosamond was not without
satisfaction that Mrs. Casaubon should have an opportunity of studying
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)_. What is the use of being exquisite if you are not seen by the
best judges? and since Rosamond had received the highest compliments at
Sir Godwin Lydgate's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt quite confident of the impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
must make on people of good birth. Dorothea put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
usual simple kindness, and looked admiringly at Lydgate's lovely
bride--aware that there was a gentleman standing at a distance, but
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) merely as a coated figure at a wide angle. The gentleman
was too much occupied with the presence of the one woman to reflect on
the contrast between the two--a contrast that would certainly have been
striking to a calm observer. They were both tall, and their eyes were
on a level; but imagine Rosamond's infantine blondness and wondrous
crown of hair-plaits, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pale-blue dress of a fit and fashion so
perfect that no dressmaker could look at it without emotion, a large
embroidered collar which it was to be hoped all beholders would know
the price of, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) small hands duly set off with rings, and that
controlled self-consciousness of manner which is the expensive
substitute for simplicity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much for allowing me to interrupt you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
immediately. <div class="bookquote">``I am anxious to see Mr. Lydgate, if possible, before I
go home, and I hoped that you might possibly tell me where I could find
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), or even allow me to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), if you expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is at the New Hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond; <div class="bookquote">``I am not sure how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
will come home. But I can send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you let me go and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will Ladislaw, coming forward.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had already taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) hat before Dorothea entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) colored
with surprise, but put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand with a smile of unmistakable
pleasure, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not know it was you: I had no thought of seeing you here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go to the Hospital and tell Mr. Lydgate that you wish to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be quicker to send the carriage for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``if
you will be kind enough to give the message to the coachman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was moving to the door when Dorothea, whose mind had flashed in an
instant over many connected memories, turned quickly and said, <div class="bookquote">``I will
go myself, thank you. I wish to lose no time before getting home
again. I will drive to the Hospital and see Mr. Lydgate there. Pray
excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate. I am very much obliged to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was evidently arrested by some sudden thought, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) left
the room hardly conscious of what was immediately around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--hardly
conscious that Will opened the door for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) arm to
lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to the carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) took the arm but said nothing. Will was
feeling rather vexed and miserable, and found nothing to say on his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) into the carriage in silence, they said good-by,
and Dorothea drove away.

<p/>In the five minutes' drive to the Hospital she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had time for some
reflections that were quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) decision to go, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
preoccupation in leaving the room, had come from the sudden sense that
there would be a sort of deception in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voluntarily allowing any
further intercourse between herself and Will which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was unable to
mention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, and already her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) errand in seeking Lydgate was a
matter of concealment. That was all that had been explicitly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
mind; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been urged also by a vague discomfort. Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) drive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heard the notes of the man's voice and the
accompanying piano, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not noted much at the time, returning
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inward sense; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found herself thinking with some wonder
that Will Ladislaw was passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) time with Mrs. Lydgate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
husband's absence. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not help remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had
passed some time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) under like circumstances, so why should there
be any unfitness in the fact? But Will was Mr. Casaubon's relative,
and one towards whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was bound to show kindness. Still there had
been signs which perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ought to have understood as implying that
Mr. Casaubon did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cousin's visits during his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own absence.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I have been mistaken in many things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said poor Dorothea to
herself, while the tears came rolling and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had to dry them quickly.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt confusedly unhappy, and the image of Will which had been so
clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) before was mysteriously spoiled. But the carriage stopped
at the gate of the Hospital. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was soon walking round the grass
plots with Lydgate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feelings recovered the strong bent which
had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seek for this interview.

<p/>Will Ladislaw, meanwhile, was mortified, and knew the reason of it
clearly enough. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) chances of meeting Dorothea were rare; and here
for the first time there had come a chance which had set him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) at a
disadvantage. It was not only, as it had been hitherto, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
not supremely occupied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) under
circumstances in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) might appear not to be supremely occupied
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) felt thrust to a new distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), amongst the
circles of Middlemarchers who made no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life. But that was
not his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) fault: of course, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) lodgings in the town,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had been making as many acquaintances as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) could, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) position
requiring that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) should know everybody and everything. Lydgate was
really better worth knowing than any one else in the neighborhood, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling
upon. Here was the whole history of the situation in which Diana had
descended too unexpectedly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) worshipper. It was mortifying. Will
was conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) should not have been at Middlemarch but for
Dorothea; and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) position there was threatening to divide him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with those barriers of habitual sentiment which are more fatal to
the persistence of mutual interest than all the distance between Rome
and Britain. Prejudices about rank and status were easy enough to defy
in the form of a tyrannical letter from Mr. Casaubon; but prejudices,
like odorous bodies, have a double existence both solid and subtle--solid
as the pyramids, subtle as the twentieth echo of an echo, or as
the memory of hyacinths which once scented the darkness. And Will was
of a temperament to feel keenly the presence of subtleties: a man of
clumsier perceptions would not have felt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, that for the first
time some sense of unfitness in perfect freedom with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sprung up
in Dorothea's mind, and that their silence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to the
carriage, had had a chill in it. Perhaps Casaubon, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hatred and
jealousy, had been insisting to Dorothea that Will had slid below her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
socially. Confound Casaubon!

<p/>Will re-entered the drawing-room, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hat, and looking
irritated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) advanced towards Mrs. Lydgate, who had seated herself
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work-table, said--

<p/>``It is always fatal to have music or poetry interrupted. May I come
another day and just finish about the rendering of <div class="bookquote">``Lungi dal caro
bene'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be happy to be taught,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``But I am sure you
admit that the interruption was a very beautiful one. I quite envy
your acquaintance with Mrs. Casaubon. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) very clever? She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looks
as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, I never thought about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, sulkily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just the answer Tertius gave me, when I first asked him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
were handsome. What is it that you gentlemen are thinking of when you
are with Mrs. Casaubon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Herself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Will, not indisposed to provoke the charming Mrs.
Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``When one sees a perfect woman, one never thinks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
attributes--one is conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) presence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
dimpling, and speaking with aery lightness. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) will come back and
think nothing of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That does not seem to have been the effect on Lydgate hitherto. Mrs.
Casaubon is too unlike other women for them to be compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a devout worshipper, I perceive. You often see her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), I
suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, almost pettishly. <div class="bookquote">``Worship is usually a matter of
theory rather than of practice. But I am practising it to excess just
at this moment--I must really tear myself away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray come again some evening: Mr. Lydgate will like to hear the music,
and I cannot enjoy it so well without him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband was at home again, Rosamond said, standing in front of
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coat-collar with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw was
here singing with me when Mrs. Casaubon came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) seemed vexed. Do
you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) at our house? Surely your
position is more than equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)--whatever may be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) relation to the
Casaubons.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; it must be something else if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) were really vexed, Ladislaw is
a sort of gypsy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) thinks nothing of leather and prunella.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Music apart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is not always very agreeable. Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes: I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is a good fellow: rather miscellaneous and
bric-a-brac, but likable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) adores Mrs. Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, smiling and pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife's ears.

<p/>Rosamond felt herself beginning to know a great deal of the world,
especially in discovering what when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) unmarried girlhood
had been inconceivable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) except as a dim tragedy in by-gone
costumes--that women, even after marriage, might make conquests and
enslave men. At that time young ladies in the country, even when
educated at Mrs. Lemon's, read little French literature later than
Racine, and public prints had not cast their present magnificent
illumination over the scandals of life. Still, vanity, with a woman's
whole mind and day to work in, can construct abundantly on slight
hints, especially on such a hint as the possibility of indefinite
conquests. How delightful to make captives from the throne of marriage
with a husband as crown-prince by your side--himself in fact a
subject--while the captives look up forever hopeless, losing their
rest probably, and if their appetite too, so much the better! But
Rosamond's romance turned at present chiefly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) crown-prince, and
it was enough to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) assured subjection. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Poor
devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) asked, with playful curiosity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, what can a man do when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes to adoring one of you mermaids?
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only neglects his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work and runs up bills.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you do not neglect your work. You are always at the
Hospital, or seeing poor patients, or thinking about some doctor's
quarrel; and then at home you always want to pore over your microscope
and phials. Confess you like those things better than me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Haven't you ambition enough to wish that your husband should be
something better than a Middlemarch doctor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hands fall on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife's shoulders, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with
affectionate gravity. ``I shall make you learn my favorite bit from an
old poet--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should our pride make such a stir to be
And be forgot? What good is like to this,
To do worthy the writing, and to write
Worthy the reading and the worlds delight?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>What I want, Rosy, is to do worthy the writing,--and to write out
myself what I have done. A man must work, to do that, my pet.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I wish you to make discoveries: no one could more wish you
to attain a high position in some better place than Middlemarch. You
cannot say that I have ever tried to hinder you from working. But we
cannot live like hermits. You are not discontented with me, Tertius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no. I am too entirely contented.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what did Mrs. Casaubon want to say to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely to ask about her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) husband's health. But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is going to

a-year.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLIV.

<p/>I would not creep along the coast but steer
Out in mid-sea, by guidance of the stars.


<p/>When Dorothea, walking round the laurel-planted plots of the New
Hospital with Lydgate, had learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that there were no signs of
change in Mr. Casaubon's bodily condition beyond the mental sign of
anxiety to know the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was silent for a few
moments, wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had said or done anything to rouse this
new anxiety. Lydgate, not willing to let slip an opportunity of
furthering a favorite purpose, ventured to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether your or Mr.--Casaubon's attention has been drawn
to the needs of our New Hospital. Circumstances have made it seem
rather egotistic in me to urge the subject; but that is not my fault:
it is because there is a fight being made against it by the other
medical men. I think you are generally interested in such things, for
I remember that when I first had the pleasure of seeing you at Tipton
Grange before your marriage, you were asking me some questions about
the way in which the health of the poor was affected by their miserable
housing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, brightening. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be quite grateful
to you if you will tell me how I can help to make things a little
better. Everything of that sort has slipped away from me since I have
been married. I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, after a moment's hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``that
the people in our village are tolerably comfortable, and my mind has
been too much taken up for me to inquire further. But here--in such a
place as Middlemarch--there must be a great deal to be done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is everything to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with abrupt energy.
<div class="bookquote">``And this Hospital is a capital piece of work, due entirely to Mr.
Bulstrode's exertions, and in a great degree to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) money. But one man
can't do everything in a scheme of this sort. Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) looked
forward to help. And now there's a mean, petty feud set up against the
thing in the town, by certain persons who want to make it a failure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can be their reasons?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with naive surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Chiefly Mr. Bulstrode's unpopularity, to begin with. Half the town
would almost take trouble for the sake of thwarting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). In this
stupid world most people never consider that a thing is good to be done
unless it is done by their own set. I had no connection with Bulstrode
before I came here. I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) quite impartially, and I see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
has some notions--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has set things on foot--which I can turn to
good public purpose. If a fair number of the better educated men went
to work with the belief that their observations might contribute to the
reform of medical doctrine and practice, we should soon see a change
for the better. That's my point of view. I hold that by refusing to
work with Mr. Bulstrode I should be turning my back on an opportunity
of making my profession more generally serviceable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite agree with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, at once fascinated by the
situation sketched in Lydgate's words. <div class="bookquote">``But what is there against Mr.
Bulstrode? I know that my uncle is friendly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``People don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) religious tone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, breaking off
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is all the stronger reason for despising such an opposition,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, looking at the affairs of Middlemarch by the light of
the great persecutions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To put the matter quite fairly, they have other objections to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>):--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
is masterful and rather unsociable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) is concerned with trade,
which has complaints of its own that I know nothing about. But what
has that to do with the question whether it would not be a fine thing
to establish here a more valuable hospital than any they have in the
county? The immediate motive to the opposition, however, is the fact
that Bulstrode has put the medical direction into my hands. Of course
I am glad of that. It gives me an opportunity of doing some good
work,--and I am aware that I have to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) choice of me. But the
consequence is, that the whole profession in Middlemarch have set
themselves tooth and nail against the Hospital, and not only refuse to
cooperate themselves, but try to blacken the whole affair and hinder
subscriptions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very petty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dorothea, indignantly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose one must expect to fight one's way: there is hardly anything
to be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is
stupendous. I don't lay claim to anything else than having used some
opportunities which have not come within everybody's reach; but there
is no stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and
happening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if I
believe that I can set going a better method of treatment--if I
believe that I can pursue certain observations and inquiries which may
be a lasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler
if I allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And
the course is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to
put my persistence in an equivocal light.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you have told me this, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
cordially. <div class="bookquote">``I feel sure I can help a little. I have some money, and
don't know what to do with it--that is often an uncomfortable thought
to me. I am sure I can spare two hundred a-year for a grand purpose
like this. How happy you must be, to know things that you feel sure
will do great good! I wish I could awake with that knowledge every
morning. There seems to be so much trouble taken that one can hardly
see the good of!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a melancholy cadence in Dorothea's voice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke these
last words. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) presently added, more cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``Pray come to
Lowick and tell us more of this. I will mention the subject to Mr.
Casaubon. I must hasten home now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did mention it that evening, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should like to
subscribe two hundred a-year--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seven hundred a-year as the
equivalent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own fortune, settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage. Mr.
Casaubon made no objection beyond a passing remark that the sum might
be disproportionate in relation to other good objects, but when
Dorothea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ignorance resisted that suggestion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) acquiesced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
did not care himself about spending money, and was not reluctant to
give it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) ever felt keenly any question of money it was through
the medium of another passion than the love of material property.

<p/>Dorothea told him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen Lydgate, and recited the gist of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) about the Hospital. Mr. Casaubon did not
question her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) further, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had wished to know what
had passed between Lydgate and himself. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows that I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said
the ever-restless voice within; but that increase of tacit knowledge
only thrust further off any confidence between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) distrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?



<p/>CHAPTER XLV.

<p/>It is the humor of many heads to extol the days of their
forefathers, and declaim against the wickedness of times
present. Which notwithstanding they cannot handsomely do,
without the borrowed help and satire of times past;
condemning the vices of their own times, by the expressions
of vices in times which they commend, which cannot but argue
the community of vice in both. Horace, therefore, Juvenal,
and Persius, were no prophets, although their lines did seem
to indigitate and point at our times.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE:
Pseudodoxia Epidemica.


<p/>That opposition to the New Fever Hospital which Lydgate had sketched to
Dorothea was, like other oppositions, to be viewed in many different
lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) regarded it as a mixture of jealousy and dunderheaded
prejudice. Mr. Bulstrode saw in it not only medical jealousy but a
determination to thwart himself, prompted mainly by a hatred of that
vital religion of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had striven to be an effectual lay
representative--a hatred which certainly found pretexts apart from
religion such as were only too easy to find in the entanglements of
human action. These might be called the ministerial views. But
oppositions have the illimitable range of objections at command, which
need never stop short at the boundary of knowledge, but can draw
forever on the vasts of ignorance. What the opposition in Middlemarch
said about the New Hospital and its administration had certainly a
great deal of echo in it, for heaven has taken care that everybody
shall not be an originator; but there were differences which
represented every social shade between the polished moderation of Dr.
Minchin and the trenchant assertion of Mrs. Dollop, the landlady of the
Tankard in Slaughter Lane.

<p/>Mrs. Dollop became more and more convinced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) own asseveration,
that Dr. Lydgate meant to let the people die in the Hospital, if not to
poison them, for the sake of cutting them up without saying by your
leave or with your leave; for it was a known <div class="bookquote">``fac''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had wanted
to cut up Mrs. Goby, as respectable a woman as any in Parley Street,
who had money in trust before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) marriage--a poor tale for a doctor,
who if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was good for anything should know what was the matter with
you before you died, and not want to pry into your inside after you
were gone. If that was not reason, Mrs. Dollop wished to know what
was; but there was a prevalent feeling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) audience that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) opinion
was a bulwark, and that if it were overthrown there would be no limits
to the cutting-up of bodies, as had been well seen in Burke and Hare
with their pitch-plaisters--such a hanging business as that was not
wanted in Middlemarch!

<p/>And let it not be supposed that opinion at the Tankard in Slaughter
Lane was unimportant to the medical profession: that old authentic
public-house--the original Tankard, known by the name of Dollop's--was
the resort of a great Benefit Club, which had some months before put to
the vote whether its long-standing medical man, <div class="bookquote">``Doctor Gambit,''  (<font color='red'><b>man Gambit</b></font>)</div>should
not be cashiered in favor of <div class="bookquote">``this Doctor Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>man Gambit</b></font>)</div>who was capable of
performing the most astonishing cures, and rescuing people altogether
given up by other practitioners. But the balance had been turned
against Lydgate by two members, who for some private reasons held that
this power of resuscitating persons as good as dead was an equivocal
recommendation, and might interfere with providential favors. In the
course of the year, however, there had been a change in the public
sentiment, of which the unanimity at Dollop's was an index.

<p/>A good deal more than a year ago, before anything was known of
Lydgate's skill, the judgments on it had naturally been divided,
depending on a sense of likelihood, situated perhaps in the pit of the
stomach or in the pineal gland, and differing in its verdicts, but not
the less valuable as a guide in the total deficit of evidence.
Patients who had chronic diseases or whose lives had long been worn
threadbare, like old Featherstone's, had been at once inclined to try
him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>); also, many who did not like paying their doctor's bills, thought
agreeably of opening an account with a new doctor and sending for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
without stint if the children's temper wanted a dose, occasions when
the old practitioners were often crusty; and all persons thus inclined
to employ Lydgate held it likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was clever. Some considered
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might do more than others <div class="bookquote">``where there was liver;'' (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>--at least
there would be no harm in getting a few bottles of <div class="bookquote">``stuff''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
since if these proved useless it would still be possible to return to
the Purifying Pills, which kept you alive if they did not remove the
yellowness. But these were people of minor importance. Good
Middlemarch families were of course not going to change their doctor
without reason shown; and everybody who had employed Mr. Peacock did
not feel obliged to accept a new man merely in the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
successor, objecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``not likely to be equal to Peacock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But Lydgate had not been long in the town before there were particulars
enough reported of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to breed much more specific expectations and to
intensify differences into partisanship; some of the particulars being
of that impressive order of which the significance is entirely hidden,
like a statistical amount without a standard of comparison, but with a
note of exclamation at the end. The cubic feet of oxygen yearly
swallowed by a full-grown man--what a shudder they might have created
in some Middlemarch circles! <div class="bookquote">``Oxygen! nobody knows what that may
be--is it any wonder the cholera has got to Dantzic? And yet there are
people who say quarantine is no good!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the facts quickly rumored was that Lydgate did not dispense
drugs. This was offensive both to the physicians whose exclusive
distinction seemed infringed on, and to the surgeon-apothecaries with
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ranged himself; and only a little while before, they might have
counted on having the law on their side against a man who without
calling himself a London-made M.D. dared to ask for pay except as a
charge on drugs. But Lydgate had not been experienced enough to
foresee that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) new course would be even more offensive to the laity;
and to Mr. Mawmsey, an important grocer in the Top Market, who, though
not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) patients, questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) in an affable manner on the
subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was injudicious enough to give a hasty popular explanation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) reasons, pointing out to Mr. Mawmsey that it must lower the
character of practitioners, and be a constant injury to the public, if
their only mode of getting paid for their work was by their making out
long bills for draughts, boluses, and mixtures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is in that way that hard-working medical men may come to be almost
as mischievous as quacks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, rather thoughtlessly. <div class="bookquote">``To get
their own bread they must overdose the king's lieges; and that's a bad
sort of treason, Mr. Mawmsey--undermines the constitution in a fatal
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mawmsey/Mawmsey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Mawmsey was not only an overseer -LRB-it was about a question of
outdoor pay that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was having an interview with Lydgate-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was also
asthmatic and had an increasing family: thus, from a medical point of
view, as well as from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was an important man; indeed, an
exceptional grocer, whose hair was arranged in a flame-like pyramid,
and whose retail deference was of the cordial, encouraging
kind--jocosely complimentary, and with a certain considerate abstinence
from letting out the full force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) mind. It was Mr. Mawmsey's
friendly jocoseness in questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) which had set the tone of
Lydgate's reply. But let the wise be warned against too great
readiness at explanation: it multiplies the sources of mistake,
lengthening the sum for reckoners sure to go wrong.

<p/>Lydgate smiled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) speech, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) foot into the
stirrup, and Mr. Mawmsey laughed more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) would have done if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) had
known who the king's lieges were, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, sir,
good-morning, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the king</b></font>)</div>with the air of one who saw everything clearly
enough. But in truth his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) views were perturbed. For years he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) had been
paying bills with strictly made items, so that for every half-crown and
eighteen-pence he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was certain something measurable had been delivered.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) had done this with satisfaction, including it among his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>)
responsibilities as a husband and father, and regarding a longer bill
than usual as a dignity worth mentioning. Moreover, in addition to the
massive benefit of the drugs to <div class="bookquote">``self and family,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) had enjoyed the
pleasure of forming an acute judgment as to their immediate effects, so
as to give an intelligent statement for the guidance of Mr. Gambit--a
practitioner just a little lower in status than Wrench or Toller, and
especially esteemed as an accoucheur, of whose ability Mr. Mawmsey had
the poorest opinion on all other points, but in doctoring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) was wont
to say in an undertone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) placed Gambit above any of them.

<p/>Here were deeper reasons than the superficial talk of a new man, which
appeared still flimsier in the drawing-room over the shop, when they
were recited to Mrs. Mawmsey, a woman accustomed to be made much of as
a fertile mother,--generally under attendance more or less frequent
from Mr. Gambit, and occasionally having attacks which required Dr.
Minchin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does this Mr. Lydgate mean to say there is no use in taking medicine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mawmsey, who was slightly given to drawling. <div class="bookquote">``I should like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to tell me how I could bear up at Fair time, if I didn't take
strengthening medicine for a month beforehand. Think of what I have to
provide for calling customers, my dear!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>--here Mrs. Mawmsey turned to
an intimate female friend who sat by--<div class="bookquote">``a large veal pie--a stuffed
fillet--a round of beef--ham, tongue, et cetera, et cetera! But what
keeps me up best is the pink mixture, not the brown. I wonder, Mr.
Mawmsey, with _your_ experience, you could have patience to listen. I
should have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) at once that I knew a little better than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mawmsey/Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mawmsey; ``I was not going to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) my
opinion. Hear everything and judge for yourself is my motto. But he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)
didn't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was talking to. I was not to be turned on _his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)_
finger. People often pretend to tell me things, when they might as
well say, ``Mawmsey, you're a fool.<div class="bookquote">'' But I smile at it: I humor
everybody's weak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I
should have found it out by this time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mawmsey a fool</b></font>)</div><p/>The next day Mr. Gambit was told that Lydgate went about saying physic
was of no use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gambit</b></font>), lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gambit</b></font>) eyebrows with cautious surprise. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Gambit</b></font>)
was a stout husky man with a large ring on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gambit</b></font>) fourth finger.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``How
will he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) cure his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) patients, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Mawmsey, who habitually gave weight
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) speech by loading her (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) pronouns. <div class="bookquote">``Does _he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)_ suppose that people
will pay him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) only to come and sit with them and go away again?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Mawmsey had had a great deal of sitting from Mr. Gambit, including
very full accounts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own habits of body and other affairs; but of
course he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knew there was no innuendo in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) remark, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) spare
time and personal narrative had never been charged for. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) replied,
humorously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Lydgate is a good-looking young fellow, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not one that I would employ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mawmsey. <div class="bookquote">''_Others_ may do as
they please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div><p/>Hence Mr. Gambit could go away from the chief grocer's without fear of
rivalry, but not without a sense that Lydgate was one of those
hypocrites who try to discredit others by advertising their own
honesty, and that it might be worth some people's while to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) up.
Mr. Gambit, however, had a satisfactory practice, much pervaded by the
smells of retail trading which suggested the reduction of cash payments
to a balance. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did not think it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) while to show Lydgate
up until he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) knew how. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had not indeed great resources of education,
and had had to work his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own way against a good deal of professional
contempt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) made none the worse accoucheur for calling the
breathing apparatus <div class="bookquote">``longs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Other medical men felt themselves more capable. Mr. Toller shared the
highest practice in the town and belonged to an old Middlemarch family:
there were Tollers in the law and everything else above the line of
retail trade. Unlike our irascible friend Wrench, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had the easiest
way in the world of taking things which might be supposed to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
being a well-bred, quietly facetious man, who kept a good house, was
very fond of a little sporting when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get it, very friendly with
Mr. Hawley, and hostile to Mr. Bulstrode. It may seem odd that with
such pleasant habits he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should have been given to the heroic treatment,
bleeding and blistering and starving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) patients, with a dispassionate
disregard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) personal example; but the incongruity favored the
opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) ability among his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) patients, who commonly observed that
Mr. Toller had lazy manners, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) treatment was as active as you
could desire: no man, said they, carried more seriousness into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
profession: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a little slow in coming, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _did_
something. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a great favorite in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own circle, and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
implied to any one's disadvantage told doubly from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) careless
ironical tone.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) naturally got tired of smiling and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told
that Mr. Peacock's successor did not mean to dispense medicines; and
Mr. Hackbutt one day mentioning it over the wine at a dinner-party, Mr.
Toller said, laughingly, <div class="bookquote">``Dibbitts will get rid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stale drugs,
then. I'm fond of little Dibbitts--I'm glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)'s in luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see your meaning, Toller,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hackbutt/Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hackbutt, <div class="bookquote">``and I am entirely of
your opinion. I shall take an opportunity of expressing myself to that
effect. A medical man should be responsible for the quality of the
drugs consumed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patients. That is the rationale of the system of
charging which has hitherto obtained; and nothing is more offensive
than this ostentation of reform, where there is no real amelioration.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hackbutt/Hackbutt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ostentation, Hackbutt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller, ironically. <div class="bookquote">``I don't see
that. A man can't very well be ostentatious of what nobody believes
in. There's no reform in the matter: the question is, whether the
profit on the drugs is paid to the medical man by the druggist or by
the patient, and whether there shall be extra pay under the name of
attendance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure; one of your damned new versions of old humbug,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Hawley, passing the decanter to Mr. Wrench.

<p/>Mr. Wrench, generally abstemious, often drank wine rather freely at a
party, getting the more irritable in consequence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to humbug, Hawley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's a word easy to fling about.
But what I contend against is the way medical men are fouling their own
nest, and setting up a cry about the country as if a general
practitioner who dispenses drugs couldn't be a gentleman. I throw back
the imputation with scorn. I say, the most ungentlemanly trick a man
can be guilty of is to come among the members of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profession with
innovations which are a libel on their time-honored procedure. That is
my opinion, and I am ready to maintain it against any one who
contradicts me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wrench's voice had become exceedingly sharp.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't oblige you there, Wrench,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) trouser-pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller, striking in pacifically, and looking
at Mr. Wrench, <div class="bookquote">``the physicians have their toes trodden on more than we
have. If you come to dignity it is a question for Minchin and Sprague.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wrench</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does medical jurisprudence provide nothing against these
infringements?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hackbutt/Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hackbutt, with a disinterested desire to offer
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) lights. <div class="bookquote">``How does the law stand, eh, Hawley?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing to be done there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley. <div class="bookquote">``I looked into it for
Sprague. You'd only break your nose against a damned judge's decision.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! no need of law,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller. <div class="bookquote">``So far as practice is
concerned the attempt is an absurdity. No patient will like
it--certainly not Peacock's, who have been used to depletion. Pass the
wine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Toller's prediction was partly verified. If Mr. and Mrs. Mawmsey,
who had no idea of employing Lydgate, were made uneasy by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) supposed
declaration against drugs, it was inevitable that those who called him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
in should watch a little anxiously to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did <div class="bookquote">``use all the
means he (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>) might use''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the case. Even good Mr. Powderell, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Powderell</b></font>)
constant charity of interpretation was inclined to esteem Lydgate the
more for what seemed a conscientious pursuit of a better plan, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mind disturbed with doubts during his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife's attack of erysipelas, and
could not abstain from mentioning to Lydgate that Mr. Peacock on a
similar occasion had administered a series of boluses which were not
otherwise definable than by their remarkable effect in bringing Mrs.
Powderell round before Michaelmas from an illness which had begun in a
remarkably hot August. At last, indeed, in the conflict between his (<font color='blue'><b>Peacock</b></font>)
desire not to hurt Lydgate and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anxiety that no <div class="bookquote">``means''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>should be
lacking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) induced his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife privately to take Widgeon's Purifying
Pills, an esteemed Middlemarch medicine, which arrested every disease
at the fountain by setting to work at once upon the blood. This
co-operative measure was not to be mentioned to Lydgate, and Mr.
Powderell himself had no certain reliance on it, only hoping that it
might be attended with a blessing.

<p/>But in this doubtful stage of Lydgate's introduction he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was helped by
what we mortals rashly call good fortune. I suppose no doctor ever
came newly to a place without making cures that surprised somebody--cures
which may be called fortune's testimonials, and deserve as much
credit as the written or printed kind. Various patients got well while
Lydgate was attending them, some even of dangerous illnesses; and it
was remarked that the new doctor with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) new ways had at least the
merit of bringing people back from the brink of death. The trash
talked on such occasions was the more vexatious to Lydgate, because it
gave precisely the sort of prestige which an incompetent and
unscrupulous man would desire, and was sure to be imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the
simmering dislike of the other medical men as an encouragement on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own part of ignorant puffing. But even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proud outspokenness was
checked by the discernment that it was as useless to fight against the
interpretations of ignorance as to whip the fog; and <div class="bookquote">``good fortune''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Larcher/Larcher</b></font>)</div>insisted on using those interpretations.

<p/>Mrs. Larcher having just become charitably concerned about alarming
symptoms in her (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) charwoman, when Dr. Minchin called, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) then and there, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) a certificate for the Infirmary;
whereupon after examination he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wrote a statement of the case as one of
tumor, and recommended the bearer Nancy Nash as an out-patient. Nancy,
calling at home on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) way to the Infirmary, allowed the stay maker and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) wife, in whose attic she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lodged, to read Dr. Minchin's paper, and
by this means became a subject of compassionate conversation in the
neighboring shops of Churchyard Lane as being afflicted with a tumor at
first declared to be as large and hard as a duck's egg, but later in
the day to be about the size of <div class="bookquote">``your fist.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>Most hearers agreed that
it would have to be cut out, but one had known of oil and another of
<div class="bookquote">``squitchineal''  (<font color='red'><b>hearers</b></font>)</div>as adequate to soften and reduce any lump in the body
when taken enough of into the inside--the oil by gradually <div class="bookquote">``soopling,''
 (<font color='red'><b>hearers</b></font>)</div>the squitchineal by eating away.

<p/>Meanwhile when Nancy presented herself at the Infirmary, it happened to
be one of Lydgate's days there. After questioning and examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>),
Lydgate said to the house-surgeon in an undertone, <div class="bookquote">``It's not tumor:
it's cramp.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) a blister and some steel mixture, and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to go home and rest, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) at the same time a note to Mrs.
Larcher, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) said, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) best employer, to testify that she (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>) was
in need of good food.

<p/>But by-and-by Nancy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) attic, became portentously worse, the
supposed tumor having indeed given way to the blister, but only
wandered to another region with angrier pain. The staymaker's wife
went to fetch Lydgate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) continued for a fortnight to attend Nancy
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) own home, until under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) treatment she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) got quite well and went
to work again. But the case continued to be described as one of tumor
in Churchyard Lane and other streets--nay, by Mrs. Larcher also; for
when Lydgate's remarkable cure was mentioned to Dr. Minchin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
naturally did not like to say, <div class="bookquote">``The case was not one of tumor, and I
was mistaken in describing it as such,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but answered, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed! ah! I
saw it was a surgical case, not of a fatal kind.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had been inwardly
annoyed, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) had asked at the Infirmary about the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>)
had recommended two days before, to hear from the house-surgeon, a
youngster who was not sorry to vex Minchin with impunity, exactly what
had occurred: he (<font color='blue'><b>Minchin</b></font>) privately pronounced that it was indecent in a general
practitioner to contradict a physician's diagnosis in that open manner,
and afterwards agreed with Wrench that Lydgate was disagreeably
inattentive to etiquette. Lydgate did not make the affair a ground for
valuing himself or -LRB-very particularly-RRB- despising Minchin, such
rectification of misjudgments often happening among men of equal
qualifications. But report took up this amazing case of tumor, not
clearly distinguished from cancer, and considered the more awful for
being of the wandering sort; till much prejudice against Lydgate's
method as to drugs was overcome by the proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) marvellous skill in
the speedy restoration of Nancy Nash after she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) had been rolling and
rolling in agonies from the presence of a tumor both hard and
obstinate, but nevertheless compelled to yield.

<p/>How could Lydgate help himself? It is offensive to tell a lady when
she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) amazement at your skill, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is altogether
mistaken and rather foolish in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) amazement. And to have entered into
the nature of diseases would only have added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) breaches of medical
propriety. Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had to wince under a promise of success given by
that ignorant praise which misses every valid quality.

<p/>In the case of a more conspicuous patient, Mr. Borthrop Trumbull,
Lydgate was conscious of having shown himself something better than an
every-day doctor, though here too it was an equivocal advantage that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
won. The eloquent auctioneer was seized with pneumonia, and having
been a patient of Mr. Peacock's, sent for Lydgate, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intention to patronize. Mr Trumbull was a robust man, a
good subject for trying the expectant theory upon--watching the course
of an interesting disease when left as much as possible to itself, so
that the stages might be noted for future guidance; and from the air
with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sensations Lydgate surmised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would
like to be taken into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) medical man's confidence, and be represented
as a partner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own cure. The auctioneer heard, without much
surprise, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a constitution which -LRB-always with due watching-RRB-
might be left to itself, so as to offer a beautiful example of a
disease with all its phases seen in clear delineation, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
probably had the rare strength of mind voluntarily to become the test
of a rational procedure, and thus make the disorder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pulmonary
functions a general benefit to society.

<p/>Mr. Trumbull acquiesced at once, and entered strongly into the view
that an illness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was no ordinary occasion for medical science.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never fear, sir; you are not speaking to one who is altogether
ignorant of the vis medicatrix,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) usual superiority of
expression, made rather pathetic by difficulty of breathing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
went without shrinking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) abstinence from drugs, much
sustained by application of the thermometer which implied the
importance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) temperature, by the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) furnished objects
for the microscope, and by learning many new words which seemed suited
to the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) secretions. For Lydgate was acute enough to
indulge him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with a little technical talk.

<p/>It may be imagined that Mr. Trumbull rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) couch with a
disposition to speak of an illness in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had manifested the
strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) mind as well as constitution; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was not backward
in awarding credit to the medical man who had discerned the quality of
patient he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had to deal with. The auctioneer was not an ungenerous man,
and liked to give others their due, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could afford it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had caught the words <div class="bookquote">``expectant method,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and rang chimes on this and
other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that Lydgate <div class="bookquote">``knew a
thing or two more than the rest of the doctors--was far better versed
in the secrets of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) profession than the majority of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) compeers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>This had happened before the affair of Fred Vincy's illness had given
to Mr. Wrench's enmity towards Lydgate more definite personal ground.
The new-comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of
rivalry, and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical
criticism or reflections on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hard-driven elders, who had had
something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
practice had spread in one or two quarters, and from the first the
report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) high family had led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) being pretty generally
invited, so that the other medical men had to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at dinner in the
best houses; and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed
always to end in a mutual attachment. There was hardly ever so much
unanimity among them as in the opinion that Lydgate was an arrogant
young fellow, and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to
show a crawling subservience to Bulstrode. That Mr. Farebrother, whose
name was a chief flag of the anti-Bulstrode party, always defended
Lydgate and made a friend of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), was referred to Farebrother's
unaccountable way of fighting on both sides.

<p/>Here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust
at the announcement of the laws Mr. Bulstrode was laying down for the
direction of the New Hospital, which were the more exasperating because
there was no present possibility of interfering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) will and
pleasure, everybody except Lord Medlicote having refused help towards
the building, on the ground that they preferred giving to the Old
Infirmary. Mr. Bulstrode met all the expenses, and had ceased to be
sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was purchasing the right to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) notions of
improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
had to spend large sums, and the building had lingered. Caleb Garth
had undertaken it, had failed during its progress, and before the
interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the
business; and when referring to the Hospital he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) often said that however
Bulstrode might ring if you tried him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) liked good solid carpentry
and masonry, and had a notion both of drains and chimneys. In fact,
the Hospital had become an object of intense interest to Bulstrode, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
might rule it dictatorially without any Board; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had another
favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of Middlemarch, and
therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) wished to get considerable contributions towards
maintaining the Hospital. Meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) framed his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) plan of management.
The Hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms; Lydgate was
to be chief medical superintendent, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might have free authority
to pursue all comparative investigations which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) studies,
particularly in Paris, had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the importance of, the other
medical visitors having a consultative influence, but no power to
contravene Lydgate's ultimate decisions; and the general management was
to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with
Mr. Bulstrode, who were to have votes in the ratio of their
contributions, the Board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers,
and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of
government.

<p/>There was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the
town to become a visitor at the Fever Hospital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate to Mr. Bulstrode, <div class="bookquote">``we have a capital
house-surgeon and dispenser, a clear-headed, neat-handed fellow; we'll
get Webbe from Crabsley, as good a country practitioner as any of them,
to come over twice a-week, and in case of any exceptional operation,
Protheroe will come from Brassing. I must work the harder, that's all,
and I have given up my post at the Infirmary. The plan will flourish
in spite of them, and then they'll be glad to come in. Things can't
last as they are: there must be all sorts of reform soon, and then
young fellows may be glad to come and study here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Lydgate was in high
spirits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not flinch, you may depend upon it, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``While I see you carrying out high intentions with vigor,
you shall have my unfailing support. And I have humble confidence that
the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit
of evil in this town will not be withdrawn. Suitable directors to
assist me I have no doubt of securing. Mr. Brooke of Tipton has
already given me his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) concurrence, and a pledge to contribute yearly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
has not specified the sum--probably not a great one. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) will be a
useful member of the board.''

 (<font color='red'><b>A member</b></font>)</div><p/>A useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate
nothing, and always vote with Mr. Bulstrode.

<p/>The medical aversion to Lydgate was hardly disguised now. Neither Dr.
Sprague nor Dr. Minchin said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sprague</b></font>) disliked Lydgate's knowledge, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) disposition to improve treatment: what they disliked was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
arrogance, which nobody felt to be altogether deniable. They implied
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was insolent, pretentious, and given to that reckless
innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the
charlatan.

<p/>The word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop. In
those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of Mr. St.
John Long, <div class="bookquote">``noblemen and gentlemen''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. St. John Long</b></font>)</div>attesting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) extraction of a fluid
like mercury from the temples of a patient.

<p/>Mr. Toller remarked one day, smilingly, to Mrs. Taft, that <div class="bookquote">``Bulstrode
had found a man to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in Lydgate; a charlatan in religion is sure
to like other sorts of charlatans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Taft</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed, I can imagine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Taft</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Taft, keeping the number of
thirty stitches carefully in her (<font color='blue'><b>Taft</b></font>) mind all the while; <div class="bookquote">``there are so many
of that sort. I remember Mr. Cheshire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) irons, trying to make
people straight when the Almighty had made them crooked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Taft</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller, <div class="bookquote">``Cheshire was all right--all fair and above
board. But there's St. John Long--that's the kind of fellow we call a
charlatan, advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about: a
fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other
people. The other day he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was pretending to tap a man's brain and get
quicksilver out of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good gracious! what dreadful trifling with people's constitutions!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Taft</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Taft.

<p/>After this, it came to be held in various quarters that Lydgate played
even with respectable constitutions for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own purposes, and how much
more likely that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) flighty experimenting he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should make sixes and
sevens of hospital patients. Especially it was to be expected, as the
landlady of the Tankard had said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would recklessly cut up their
dead bodies. For Lydgate having attended Mrs. Goby, who died
apparently of a heart-disease not very clearly expressed in the
symptoms, too daringly asked leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) relatives to open the body,
and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond Parley Street, where
that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association
of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) body with the victims of Burke and Hare a flagrant insult to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
memory.

<p/>Affairs were in this stage when Lydgate opened the subject of the
Hospital to Dorothea. We see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was bearing enmity and silly
misconception with much spirit, aware that they were partly created by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) good share of success.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They will not drive me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, talking confidentially in Mr.
Farebrother's study. <div class="bookquote">``I have got a good opportunity here, for the ends
I care most about; and I am pretty sure to get income enough for our
wants. By-and-by I shall go on as quietly as possible: I have no
seductions now away from home and work. And I am more and more
convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous
origin of all the tissues. Raspail and others are on the same track,
and I have been losing time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no power of prophecy there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, who had been
puffing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) pipe thoughtfully while Lydgate talked; <div class="bookquote">``but as to the
hostility in the town, you'll weather it if you are prudent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How am I to be prudent?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``I just do what comes before me
to do. I can't help people's ignorance and spite, any more than
Vesalius could. It isn't possible to square one's conduct to silly
conclusions which nobody can foresee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true; I didn't mean that. I meant only two things. One is,
keep yourself as separable from Bulstrode as you can: of course, you
can go on doing good work of your own by his (<font color='blue'><b>Vesalius</b></font>) help; but don't get tied.
Perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so--and there's a
good deal of that, I own--but personal feeling is not always in the
wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an
opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bulstrode is nothing to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``except on
public grounds. As to getting very closely united to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vesalius</b></font>), I am not
fond enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Vesalius</b></font>) for that. But what was the other thing you meant?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, who was nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) leg as comfortably as possible, and
feeling in no great need of advice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, this. Take care--experto crede--take care not to get hampered
about money matters. I know, by a word you let fall one day, that you
don't like my playing at cards so much for money. You are right enough
there. But try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven't
got. I am perhaps talking rather superfluously; but a man likes to
assume superiority over himself, by holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bad example and
sermonizing on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate took Mr. Farebrother's hints very cordially, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would
hardly have borne them from another man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not help remembering
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had lately made some debts, but these had seemed inevitable,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way.
The furniture for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) owed would not want renewing; nor even the
stock of wine for a long while.

<p/>Many thoughts cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at that time--and justly. A man conscious of
enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the
memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds,
and who hover in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind as patron saints, invisibly helping. At
home, that same evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been chatting with Mr. Farebrother,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) long legs stretched on the sofa, his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) head thrown back, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) hands clasped behind it according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) favorite ruminating
attitude, while Rosamond sat at the piano, and played one tune after
another, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband only knew -LRB-like the emotional elephant he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
was!-RRB- that they fell in with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mood as if they had been melodious
sea-breezes.

<p/>There was something very fine in Lydgate's look just then, and any one
might have been encouraged to bet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) achievement. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dark eyes
and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the
fulness of contemplative thought--the mind not searching, but
beholding, and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it.

<p/>Presently Rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close
to the sofa and opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that enough music for you, my lord?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and putting on a little air of meekness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, if you are tired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, gently, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes
and resting them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), but not otherwise moving. Rosamond's presence
at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) woman's instinct in this matter was not dull.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is absorbing you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, leaning forward and bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
face nearer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands and placed them gently behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) shoulders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am thinking of a great fellow, who was about as old as I am three
hundred years ago, and had already begun a new era in anatomy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't guess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``We used to play at
guessing historical characters at Mrs. Lemon's, but not anatomists.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name was Vesalius. And the only way he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could get
to know anatomy as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did, was by going to snatch bodies at night, from
graveyards and places of execution.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with a look of disgust on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pretty face, <div class="bookquote">``I am
very glad you are not Vesalius. I should have thought he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might find
some less horrible way than that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, going on too earnestly to take much
notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could only get a complete skeleton by
snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows, and
burying them, and fetching them away by bits secretly, in the dead of
night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not one of your great heroes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, half
playfully, half anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``else I shall have you getting up in the
night to go to St. Peter's churchyard. You know how angry you told me
the people were about Mrs. Goby. You have enemies enough already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So had Vesalius, Rosy. No wonder the medical fogies in Middlemarch
are jealous, when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon
Vesalius because they had believed in Galen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) showed that Galen
was wrong. They called him (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) a liar and a poisonous monster. But the
facts of the human frame were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) side; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) got the better of
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) afterwards?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with some
interest.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) had a good deal of fighting to the last. And they did
exasperate him (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) enough at one time to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) burn a good deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>)
work. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) got shipwrecked just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) was coming from Jerusalem to
take a great chair at Padua. He (<font color='blue'><b>Galen</b></font>) died rather miserably.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a moment's pause before Rosamond said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Tertius,
I often wish you had not been a medical man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, Rosy, don't say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``That is like saying you wish you had married another man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all; you are clever enough for anything: you might easily have
been something else. And your cousins at Quallingham all think that
you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The cousins at Quallingham may go to the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with
scorn. <div class="bookquote">``It was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``I do _not_ think it is a nice profession,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the grandest profession in the world, Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
gravely. <div class="bookquote">``And to say that you love me without loving the medical man

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Doctor Grave-face,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosy</b></font>)</div>said Rosy, dimpling, <div class="bookquote">``I will declare in

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, not so bad as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, giving up remonstrance and

<p/>CHAPTER XLVI.

<p/>Pues no podemos haber aquello que queremos, queramos
aquello que podremos.

<p/>Since we cannot get what we like, let us like
what we can get.
--Spanish Proverb.


<p/>While Lydgate, safely married and with the Hospital under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) command,
felt himself struggling for Medical Reform against Middlemarch,
Middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national
struggle for another kind of Reform.

<p/>By the time that Lord John Russell's measure was being debated in the
House of Commons, there was a new political animation in Middlemarch,
and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of
balance if a new election came. And there were some who already
predicted this event, declaring that a Reform Bill would never be
carried by the actual Parliament. This was what Will Ladislaw dwelt on
to Mr. Brooke as a reason for congratulation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had not yet tried
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) strength at the hustings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will.
``The public temper will soon get to a cometary heat, now the question
of Reform has set in. There is likely to be another election before
long, and by that time Middlemarch will have got more ideas into its
head. What we have to work at now is the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer' and political
meetings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, Ladislaw; we shall make a new thing of opinion here,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``Only I want to keep myself independent about Reform,
you know; I don't want to go too far. I want to take up
Wilberforce's and Romilly's line, you know, and work at Negro
Emancipation, Criminal Law--that kind of thing. But of course I should
support Grey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you go in for the principle of Reform, you must be prepared to take
what the situation offers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``If everybody pulled for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
own bit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, I agree with you--I quite take that point of view. I should
put it in that light. I should support Grey, you know. But I don't
want to change the balance of the constitution, and I don't think Grey
would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that is what the country wants,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``Else there would be
no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what
it's about. It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted
with nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the
other interests. And as to contending for a reform short of that, it
is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to
thunder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is fine, Ladislaw: that is the way to put it. Write that down,
now. We must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country,
as well as the machine-breaking and general distress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As to documents,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, <div class="bookquote">``a two-inch card will hold plenty. A few
rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from, and a few more will
show the rate at which the political determination of the people is
growing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>``Good: draw that out a little more at length, Ladislaw. That is an
idea, now: write it out in the ``Pioneer.<div class="bookquote">'' Put the figures and deduce
the misery, you know; and put the other figures and deduce--and so on.
You have a way of putting things. Burke, now:--when I think of Burke,
I can't help wishing somebody had a pocket-borough to give you,
Ladislaw. You'd never get elected, you know. And we shall always want
talent in the House: reform as we will, we shall always want talent.
That avalanche and the thunder, now, was really a little like Burke. I
want that sort of thing--not ideas, you know, but a way of putting
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pocket-boroughs would be a fine thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Ladislaw, <div class="bookquote">``if they were
always in the right pocket, and there were always a Burke at hand.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison, even from
Mr. Brooke; for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be
conscious of expressing one's self better than others and never to have
it noticed, and in the general dearth of admiration for the right
thing, even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather
fortifying. Will felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) literary refinements were usually
beyond the limits of Middlemarch perception; nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was
beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) began he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
said to himself rather languidly, <div class="bookquote">``Why not?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) studied the
political situation with as ardent an interest as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had ever given to
poetic metres or mediaevalism. It is undeniable that but for the
desire to be where Dorothea was, and perhaps the want of knowing what
else to do, Will would not at this time have been meditating on the
needs of the English people or criticising English statesmanship: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
would probably have been rambling in Italy sketching plans for several
dramas, trying prose and finding it too jejune, trying verse and
finding it too artificial, beginning to copy <div class="bookquote">``bits''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from old pictures,
leaving off because they were <div class="bookquote">``no good,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and observing that, after all,
self-culture was the principal point; while in politics he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would have
been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general. Our
sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place
of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not
a matter of indifference.

<p/>Ladislaw had now accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) bit of work, though it was not that
indeterminate loftiest thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had once dreamed of as alone
worthy of continuous effort. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) nature warmed easily in the presence
of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action, and the
easily stirred rebellion in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) helped the glow of public spirit. In
spite of Mr. Casaubon and the banishment from Lowick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was rather
happy; getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for
practical purposes, and making the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>celebrated as far as
Brassing -LRB-never mind the smallness of the area; the writing was not
worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth-RRB-.

<p/>Mr. Brooke was occasionally irritating; but Will's impatience was
relieved by the division of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) time between visits to the Grange and
retreats to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) Middlemarch lodgings, which gave variety to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shift the pegs a little,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and Mr. Brooke might be
in the Cabinet, while I was Under-Secretary. That is the common order
of things: the little waves make the large ones and are of the same
pattern. I am better here than in the sort of life Mr. Casaubon would
have trained me for, where the doing would be all laid down by a
precedent too rigid for me to react upon. I don't care for prestige or
high pay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As Lydgate had said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a sort of gypsy, rather enjoying the
sense of belonging to no class; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had a feeling of romance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
position, and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise
wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went. That sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had felt some new distance between himself and Dorothea in their
accidental meeting at Lydgate's, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) irritation had gone out
towards Mr. Casaubon, who had declared beforehand that Will would lose
caste. <div class="bookquote">``I never had any caste,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would have said, if that prophecy
had been uttered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and the quick blood would have come and gone
like breath in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) transparent skin. But it is one thing to like
defiance, and another thing to like its consequences.

<p/>Meanwhile, the town opinion about the new editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>was
tending to confirm Mr. Casaubon's view. Will's relationship in that
distinguished quarter did not, like Lydgate's high connections, serve
as an advantageous introduction: if it was rumored that young Ladislaw
was Mr. Casaubon's nephew or cousin, it was also rumored that <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Casaubon would have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brooke has taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, <div class="bookquote">``because that is what no
man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses could have expected. Casaubon has devilish good
reasons, you may be sure, for turning the cold shoulder on a young
fellow whose bringing-up he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) paid for. Just like Brooke--one of those
fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/>And some oddities of Will's, more or less poetical, appeared to support
Mr. Keck, the editor of the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>in asserting that Ladislaw, if
the truth were known, was not only a Polish emissary but crack-brained,
which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>)
speech when he (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) got on to a platform--as he (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) did whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>emissary</b></font>) had an
opportunity, speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid
Englishmen generally. It was disgusting to Keck to see a strip of a
fellow, with light curls round his (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) head, get up and speechify by the
hour against institutions <div class="bookquote">``which had existed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
cradle.''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>And in a leading article of the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Keck</b></font>)</div>Keck characterized
Ladislaw's speech at a Reform meeting as <div class="bookquote">``the violence of an
energumen--a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks
the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge
which was of the cheapest and most recent description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a rattling article yesterday, Keck,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Sprague</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Sprague, with
sarcastic intentions. <div class="bookquote">``But what is an energumen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, a term that came up in the French Revolution,''  (<font color='red'><b>Keck</b></font>)</div>said Keck.

<p/>This dangerous aspect of Ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other
habits which became matter of remark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) had a fondness, half
artistic, half affectionate, for little children--the smaller they were
on tolerably active legs, and the funnier their clothing, the better
Will liked to surprise and please them. We know that in Rome he (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) was
given to ramble about among the poor people, and the taste did not quit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) in Middlemarch.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) had somehow picked up a troop of droll children, little hatless boys
with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out,
little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>),
and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven. This troop he (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) had
led out on gypsy excursions to Halsell Wood at nutting-time, and since
the cold weather had set in he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had taken them on a clear day to gather
sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) drew out a
small feast of gingerbread for them, and improvised a Punch-and-Judy
drama with some private home-made puppets. Here was one oddity.
Another was, that in houses where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) got friendly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) was given to
stretch himself at full length on the rug while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) talked, and was apt
to be discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such
an irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) dangerously
mixed blood and general laxity.

<p/>But Will's articles and speeches naturally recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) in families
which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side
of Reform. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was invited to Mr. Bulstrode's; but here he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could not
lie down on the rug, and Mrs. Bulstrode felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mode of talking
about Catholic countries, as if there were any truce with Antichrist,
illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men.

<p/>At Mr. Farebrother's, however, whom the irony of events had brought on
the same side with Bulstrode in the national movement, Will became a
favorite with the ladies; especially with little Miss Noble, whom it
was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) oddities to escort when he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in the street with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) little basket, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) arm in the eyes of the town, and
insisting on going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to pay some call where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) distributed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
small filchings from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own share of sweet things.

<p/>But the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was
Lydgate's. The two men were not at all alike, but they agreed none the
worse. Lydgate was abrupt but not irritable, taking little notice of
megrims in healthy people; and Ladislaw did not usually throw away his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them. With Rosamond,
on the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) pouted and was wayward--nay, often
uncomplimentary, much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) inward surprise; nevertheless he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was
gradually becoming necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) entertainment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) companionship
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) music, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) varied talk, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) freedom from the grave
preoccupation which, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's tenderness and indulgence,
often made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) manners unsatisfactory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) dislike
of the medical profession.

<p/>Lydgate, inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the
people in the efficacy of <div class="bookquote">``the bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>while nobody cared about the low
state of pathology, sometimes assailed Will with troublesome questions.
One evening in March, Rosamond in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cherry-colored dress with
swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea-table; Lydgate,
lately come in tired from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) outdoor work, was seated sideways on an
easy-chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brow looking a
little troubled as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes rambled over the columns of the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>while Rosamond, having noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was perturbed, avoided looking
at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and inwardly thanked heaven that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) herself had not a moody
disposition. Will Ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the
curtain-pole abstractedly, and humming very low the notes of <div class="bookquote">``When
first I saw thy face;''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>while the house spaniel, also stretched out with
small choice of room, looked from between his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) paws at the usurper of
the rug with silent but strong objection.

<p/>Rosamond bringing Lydgate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cup of tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) threw down the paper, and
said to Will, who had started up and gone to the table--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's no use your puffing Brooke as a reforming landlord, Ladislaw:
they only pick the more holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) coat in the `Trumpet.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>``No matter; those who read the ``Pioneer' don't read the `Trumpet,'''
said Will, swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) tea and walking about. ``Do you suppose the
public reads with a view to its own conversion? We should have a
witches' brewing with a vengeance then--<div class="bookquote">``Mingle, mingle, mingle,
mingle, You that mingle may'--and nobody would know which side he (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) was
going to take.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a witches</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Farebrother says, he (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) doesn't believe Brooke would get elected if the
opportunity came: the very men who profess to be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Keck</b></font>) would bring
another member out of the bag at the right moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no harm in trying. It's good to have resident members.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, who was much given to use that inconvenient word
in a curt tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They represent the local stupidity better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, laughing, and
shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) curls; <div class="bookquote">``and they are kept on their best behavior in the
neighborhood. Brooke is not a bad fellow, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has done some good
things on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) estate that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never would have done but for this
Parliamentary bite.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s not fitted to be a public man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with contemptuous
decision. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would disappoint everybody who counted on him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>): I can see
that at the Hospital. Only, there Bulstrode holds the reins and drives
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends on how you fix your standard of public men,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)'s good enough for the occasion: when the people have made up their
mind as they are making it up now, they don't want a man--they only
want a vote.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the way with you political writers, Ladislaw--crying up a
measure as if it were a universal cure, and crying up men who are a
part of the very disease that wants curing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? Men may help to cure themselves off the face of the land
without knowing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, who could find reasons impromptu, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had not thought of a question beforehand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is no excuse for encouraging the superstitious exaggeration of
hopes about this particular measure, helping the cry to swallow it
whole and to send up voting popinjays who are good for nothing but to
carry it. You go against rottenness, and there is nothing more
thoroughly rotten than making people believe that society can be cured
by a political hocus-pocus.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's very fine, my dear fellow. But your cure must begin somewhere,
and put it that a thousand things which debase a population can never
be reformed without this particular reform to begin with. Look what
Stanley said the other day--that the House had been tinkering long
enough at small questions of bribery, inquiring whether this or that
voter has had a guinea when everybody knows that the seats have been
sold wholesale. Wait for wisdom and conscience in public
agents--fiddlestick! The only conscience we can trust to is the
massive sense of wrong in a class, and the best wisdom that will work
is the wisdom of balancing claims. That's my text--which side is
injured? I support the man who supports their claims; not the virtuous
upholder of the wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That general talk about a particular case is mere question begging,
Ladislaw. When I say, I go in for the dose that cures, it doesn't
follow that I go in for opium in a given case of gout.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not begging the question we are upon--whether we are to try for
nothing till we find immaculate men to work with. Should you go on
that plan? If there were one man who would carry you a medical reform
and another who would oppose it, should you inquire which had the
better motives or even the better brains?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, seeing himself checkmated by a move
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had often used himself, <div class="bookquote">``if one did not work with such men as
are at hand, things must come to a dead-lock. Suppose the worst opinion
in the town about Bulstrode were a true one, that would not make it
less true that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has the sense and the resolution to do what I think
ought to be done in the matters I know and care most about; but that is
the only ground on which I go with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lydgate added rather proudly,
bearing in mind Mr. Farebrother's remarks. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing to me
otherwise; I would not cry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up on any personal ground--I would keep
clear of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that I cry up Brooke on any personal ground?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will
Ladislaw, nettled, and turning sharp round. For the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) felt
offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would have
declined any close inquiry into the growth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) relation to Mr.
Brooke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``I was simply explaining my own action. I
meant that a man may work for a special end with others whose motives
and general course are equivocal, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is quite sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal
independence, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not working for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private
interest--either place or money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, why don't you extend your liberality to others?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will,
still nettled. <div class="bookquote">``My personal independence is as important to me as
yours is to you. You have no more reason to imagine that I have
personal expectations from Brooke, than I have to imagine that you have
personal expectations from Bulstrode. Motives are points of honor, I
suppose--nobody can prove them. But as to money and place in the
world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will ended, tossing back his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I think it is pretty clear
that I am not determined by considerations of that sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You quite mistake me, Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, surprised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been
preoccupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own vindication, and had been blind to what
Ladislaw might infer on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own account. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon for
unintentionally annoying you. In fact, I should rather attribute to
you a romantic disregard of your own worldly interests. On the
political question, I referred simply to intellectual bias.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very unpleasant you both are this evening!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``I
cannot conceive why money should have been referred to. Polities and
Medicine are sufficiently disagreeable to quarrel upon. You can both
of you go on quarrelling with all the world and with each other on
those two topics.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond looked mildly neutral as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said this, rising to ring the
bell, and then crossing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) work-table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Rosy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was
passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Disputation is not amusing to cherubs. Have some music.
Ask Ladislaw to sing with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>When Will was gone Rosamond said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">``What put you out of
temper this evening, Tertius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? It was Ladislaw who was out of temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) is like a bit of
tinder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mean, before that. Something had vexed you before you came in,
you looked cross. And that made you begin to dispute with Mr.
Ladislaw. You hurt me very much when you look so, Tertius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I? Then I am a brute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, caressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) penitently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What vexed you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, outdoor things--business.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was really a letter insisting on
the payment of a bill for furniture. But Rosamond was expecting to
have a baby, and Lydgate wished to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from any perturbation.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVII.

<p/>Was never true love loved in vain,
For truest love is highest gain.
No art can make it: it must spring
Where elements are fostering.
So in heaven's spot and hour
Springs the little native flower,
Downward root and upward eye,
Shapen by the earth and sky.


<p/>It happened to be on a Saturday evening that Will Ladislaw had that
little discussion with Lydgate. Its effect when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own
rooms was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) sit up half the night, thinking over again, under
a new irritation, all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had before thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) having settled
in Middlemarch and harnessed himself with Mr. Brooke. Hesitations
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had taken the step had since turned into susceptibility to
every hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would have been wiser not to take it; and hence came
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) heat towards Lydgate--a heat which still kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) restless. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
not making a fool of himself?--and at a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was more than
ever conscious of being something better than a fool? And for what end?

<p/>Well, for no definite end. True, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had dreamy visions of
possibilities: there is no human being who having both passions and
thoughts does not think in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) passions--does not find
images rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind which soothe the passion with hope or sting
it with dread. But this, which happens to us all, happens to some with
a wide difference; and Will was not one of those whose wit <div class="bookquote">``keeps the
roadway:''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) bypaths where there were little joys of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own
choosing, such as gentlemen cantering on the highroad might have
thought rather idiotic. The way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) made a sort of happiness
for himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) feeling for Dorothea was an example of this. It
may seem strange, but it is the fact, that the ordinary vulgar vision
of which Mr. Casaubon suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--namely, that Dorothea might become
a widow, and that the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had established in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind might
turn into acceptance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as a husband--had no tempting, arresting
power over him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not live in the scenery of such an event, and
follow it out, as we all do with that imagined <div class="bookquote">``otherwise''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which is our
practical heaven. It was not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was unwilling to entertain
thoughts which could be accused of baseness, and was already uneasy in
the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had to justify himself from the charge of
ingratitude--the latent consciousness of many other barriers between
himself and Dorothea besides the existence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, had helped
to turn away his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) imagination from speculating on what might befall Mr.
Casaubon. And there were yet other reasons. Will, we know, could not
bear the thought of any flaw appearing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) crystal: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was at once
exasperated and delighted by the calm freedom with which Dorothea
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and there was something so exquisite in
thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could not long for a change
which must somehow change her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Do we not shun the street version of a
fine melody?--or shrink from the news that the rarity--some bit of
chiselling or engraving perhaps--which we have dwelt on even with
exultation in the trouble it has cost us to snatch glimpses of it, is
really not an uncommon thing, and may be obtained as an every-day
possession? Our good depends on the quality and breadth of our
emotion; and to Will, a creature who cared little for what are called
the solid things of life and greatly for its subtler influences, to
have within him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) such a feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had towards Dorothea, was like the
inheritance of a fortune. What others might have called the futility
of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) passion, made an additional delight for his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) imagination: he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was
conscious of a generous movement, and of verifying in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own
experience that higher love-poetry which had charmed his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) fancy.
Dorothea, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) said to himself, was forever enthroned in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) soul: no
other woman could sit higher than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) footstool; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could have
written out in immortal syllables the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrought within him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>)
might have boasted after the example of old Drayton, that,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Queens hereafter might be glad to live
Upon the alms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) superfluous praise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But this result was questionable. And what else could he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) do for
Dorothea? What was his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) devotion worth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)? It was impossible to
tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would not go out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reach. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) saw no creature among her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
friends to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke with the same simple
confidence as to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had once said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would like him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to
stay; and stay he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would, whatever fire-breathing dragons might hiss
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>This had always been the conclusion of Will's hesitations. But he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was
not without contradictoriness and rebellion even towards his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own
resolve. He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had often got irritated, as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was on this particular
night, by some outside demonstration that his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) public exertions with Mr.
Brooke as a chief could not seem as heroic as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) would like them to be,
and this was always associated with the other ground of
irritation--that notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) sacrifice of dignity for
Dorothea's sake, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could hardly ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Whereupon, not being
able to contradict these unpleasant facts, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) contradicted his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own
strongest bias and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am a fool.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Nevertheless, since the inward debate necessarily turned on Dorothea,
he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) ended, as he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had done before, only by getting a livelier sense of
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) presence would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>); and suddenly reflecting that the
morrow would be Sunday, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) determined to go to Lowick Church and see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) slept upon that idea, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was dressing in the rational
morning light, Objection said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will be a virtual defiance of Mr. Casaubon's prohibition to visit
Lowick, and Dorothea will be displeased.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>argued Inclination, <div class="bookquote">``it would be too monstrous for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to
hinder me from going out to a pretty country church on a spring
morning. And Dorothea will be glad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be clear to Mr. Casaubon that you have come either to annoy
him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) or to see Dorothea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not true that I go to annoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and why should I not go to see
Dorothea? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to have everything to himself and be always
comfortable? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) smart a little, as other people are obliged to
do. I have always liked the quaintness of the church and congregation;
besides, I know the Tuckers: I shall go into their pew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Having silenced Objection by force of unreason, Will walked to Lowick
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had been on the way to Paradise, crossing Halsell Common and
skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding
boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green
growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was
Sunday, and to approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt
happy when nothing crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) humor, and by this time the thought of
vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), making his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) face
break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine
on the water--though the occasion was not exemplary. But most of us
are apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is
odious, and not to mind causing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little of the disgust which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
personality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book
under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but
chanting a little, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made scenes of what would happen in church and
coming out. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The
words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Sunday
experience:--

<p/>``O me, O me, what frugal cheer
My love doth feed upon!
A touch, a ray, that is not here,
A shadow that is gone:

<p/>``A dream of breath that might be near,
An inly-echoed tone,
The thought that one may think me dear,
The place where one was known,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The tremor of a banished fear,
An ill that was not done--
O me, O me, what frugal cheer
My love doth feed upon!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head backward, and
showing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) delicate throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sang, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like an incarnation
of the spring whose spirit filled the air--a bright creature, abundant
in uncertain promises.

<p/>The bells were still ringing when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got to Lowick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into
the curate's pew before any one else arrived there. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still
left alone in it when the congregation had assembled. The curate's pew
was opposite the rector's at the entrance of the small chancel, and
Will had time to fear that Dorothea might not come while he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) looked
round at the group of rural faces which made the congregation from year
to year within the white-washed walls and dark old pews, hardly with
more change than we see in the boughs of a tree which breaks here and
there with age, but yet has young shoots. Mr. Rigg's frog-face was
something alien and unaccountable, but notwithstanding this shock to
the order of things, there were still the Waules and the rural stock of
the Powderells in their pews side by side; brother Samuel's cheek had
the same purple round as ever, and the three generations of decent
cottagers came as of old with a sense of duty to their betters
generally--the smaller children regarding Mr. Casaubon, who wore the
black gown and mounted to the highest box, as probably the chief of all
betters, and the one most awful if offended. Even in 1831 Lowick was
at peace, not more agitated by Reform than by the solemn tenor of the
Sunday sermon. The congregation had been used to seeing Will at church
in former days, and no one took much note of him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) except the choir, who
expected him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) to make a figure in the singing.

<p/>Dorothea did at last appear on this quaint background, walking up the
short aisle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) white beaver bonnet and gray cloak--the same she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
worn in the Vatican. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face being, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) entrance, towards the
chancel, even her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) shortsighted eyes soon discerned Will, but there was
no outward show of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feeling except a slight paleness and a grave bow
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>). To his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) own surprise Will felt suddenly
uncomfortable, and dared not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) after they had bowed to each
other. Two minutes later, when Mr. Casaubon came out of the vestry,
and, entering the pew, seated himself in face of Dorothea, Will felt
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) paralysis more complete. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could look nowhere except at the choir
in the little gallery over the vestry-door: Dorothea was perhaps
pained, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had made a wretched blunder. It was no longer amusing
to vex Mr. Casaubon, who had the advantage probably of watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and
seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dared not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) head. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) not imagined this
beforehand?--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could not expect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) should sit in that square
pew alone, unrelieved by any Tuckers, who had apparently departed from
Lowick altogether, for a new clergyman was in the desk. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
called himself stupid now for not foreseeing that it would be
impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) to look towards Dorothea--nay, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might feel
his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) coming an impertinence. There was no delivering himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>)
cage, however; and Will found his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) places and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) book as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had been a school-mistress, feeling that the morning service had
never been so immeasurably long before, that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was utterly ridiculous,
out of temper, and miserable. This was what a man got by worshipping
the sight of a woman! The clerk observed with surprise that Mr.
Ladislaw did not join in the tune of Hanover, and reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
might have a cold.

<p/>Mr. Casaubon did not preach that morning, and there was no change in
Will's situation until the blessing had been pronounced and every one
rose. It was the fashion at Lowick for <div class="bookquote">``the betters''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>to go out first.
With a sudden determination to break the spell that was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), Will
looked straight at Mr. Casaubon. But that gentleman's eyes were on the
button of the pew-door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) opened, allowing Dorothea to pass, and
following her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) immediately without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) eyelids. Will's glance
had caught Dorothea's as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) turned out of the pew, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
bowed, but this time with a look of agitation, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were
repressing tears. Will walked out after them, but they went on towards
the little gate leading out of the churchyard into the shrubbery, never
looking round.

<p/>It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to follow them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could only walk back
sadly at mid-day along the same road which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had trodden hopefully in
the morning. The lights were all changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) both without and
within.



<p/>CHAPTER XLVIII

<p/>Surely the golden hours are turning gray
And dance no more, and vainly strive to run:
I see their white locks streaming in the wind--
Each face is haggard as it looks at me,
Slow turning in the constant clasping round
Storm-driven.


<p/>Dorothea's distress when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was leaving the church came chiefly from
the perception that Mr. Casaubon was determined not to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
cousin, and that Will's presence at church had served to mark more
strongly the alienation between them. Will's coming seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
quite excusable, nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought it an amiable movement in him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) towards
a reconciliation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself had been constantly wishing for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
had probably imagined, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had, that if Mr. Casaubon and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could
meet easily, they would shake hands and friendly intercourse might
return. But now Dorothea felt quite robbed of that hope. Will was
banished further than ever, for Mr. Casaubon must have been newly
embittered by this thrusting upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) of a presence which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) refused to
recognize.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had not been very well that morning, suffering from some difficulty
in breathing, and had not preached in consequence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not
surprised, therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was nearly silent at luncheon, still less
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) made no allusion to Will Ladislaw. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own part she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could never again introduce that subject. They usually spent
apart the hours between luncheon and dinner on a Sunday; Mr. Casaubon
in the library dozing chiefly, and Dorothea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) boudoir, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was wont to occupy herself with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) favorite books. There was
a little heap of them on the table in the bow-window--of various sorts,
from Herodotus, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was learning to read with Mr. Casaubon, to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) old companion Pascal, and Keble's <div class="bookquote">``Christian Year.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pascal/PASCAL</b></font>)</div>But to-day
opened one after another, and could read none of them. Everything
seemed dreary: the portents before the birth of Cyrus--Jewish
antiquities--oh dear!--devout epigrams--the sacred chime of favorite
hymns--all alike were as flat as tunes beaten on wood: even the spring
flowers and the grass had a dull shiver in them under the afternoon
clouds that hid the sun fitfully; even the sustaining thoughts which
had become habits seemed to have in them the weariness of long future
days in which she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would still live with them for her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sole companions.
It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor
Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual
effort demanded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) married life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was always trying to be what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband wished, and never able to repose on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) delight in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was. The thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) liked, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spontaneously cared to have,
seemed to be always excluded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life; for if it was only granted
and not shared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband it might as well have been denied. About
Will Ladislaw there had been a difference between them from the first,
and it had ended, since Mr. Casaubon had so severely repulsed
Dorothea's strong feeling about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) claims on the family property, by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) being convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was in the right and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband in the
wrong, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was helpless. This afternoon the helplessness was
more wretchedly benumbing than ever: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) longed for objects who could
be dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could be dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) longed for work
which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain, and
now it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was to live more and more in a virtual tomb,
where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would
never see the light. Today she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had stood at the door of the tomb and
seen Will Ladislaw receding into the distant world of warm activity and
fellowship--turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) face towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) went.

<p/>Books were of no use. Thinking was of no use. It was Sunday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
could not have the carriage to go to Celia, who had lately had a baby.
There was no refuge now from spiritual emptiness and discontent, and
Dorothea had to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bad mood, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have borne a headache.

<p/>After dinner, at the hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usually began to read aloud, Mr.
Casaubon proposed that they should go into the library, where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had ordered a fire and lights. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) seemed to have revived, and to be
thinking intently.

<p/>In the library Dorothea observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had newly arranged a row of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) note-books on a table, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) took up and put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand a
well-known volume, which was a table of contents to all the others.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will oblige me, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, seating himself, ``if instead of
other reading this evening, you will go through this aloud, pencil in
hand, and at each point where I say ``mark,<div class="bookquote">'' will make a cross with your
pencil. This is the first step in a sifting process which I have long
had in view, and as we go on I shall be able to indicate to you certain
principles of selection whereby you will, I trust, have an intelligent
participation in my purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) memorable
interview with Lydgate, that Mr. Casaubon's original reluctance to let
Dorothea work with him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had given place to the contrary disposition,
namely, to demand much interest and labor from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had read and marked for two hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``We will take the
volume up-stairs--and the pencil, if you please--and in case of
reading in the night, we can pursue this task. It is not wearisome to
you, I trust, Dorothea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I prefer always reading what you like best to hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
who told the simple truth; for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dreaded was to exert herself in
reading or anything else which left him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as joyless as ever.

<p/>It was a proof of the force with which certain characteristics in
Dorothea impressed those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
jealousy and suspicion, had gathered implicit trust in the integrity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) promises, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) power of devoting herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) idea of the
right and best. Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had begun to feel that these qualities were
a peculiar possession for himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted to engross them.

<p/>The reading in the night did come. Dorothea in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) young weariness had
slept soon and fast: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was awakened by a sense of light, which seemed
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at first like a sudden vision of sunset after she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had climbed a
steep hill: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) warm
gown seating himself in the arm-chair near the fire-place where the
embers were still glowing. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had lit two candles, expecting that
Dorothea would awake, but not liking to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) by more direct means.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ill, Edward?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, rising immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I felt some uneasiness in a reclining posture. I will sit here for a
time.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) threw wood on the fire, wrapped herself up, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You
would like me to read to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You would oblige me greatly by doing so, Dorothea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon,
with a shade more meekness than usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) polite manner. <div class="bookquote">``I am
wakeful: my mind is remarkably lucid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear that the excitement may be too great for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
remembering Lydgate's cautions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not conscious of undue excitement. Thought is easy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea dared not insist, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) read for an hour or more on the same
plan as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had done in the evening, but getting over the pages with
more quickness. Mr. Casaubon's mind was more alert, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) seemed to
anticipate what was coming after a very slight verbal indication,
saying, <div class="bookquote">``That will do--mark that'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--or <div class="bookquote">``Pass on to the next head--I omit
the second excursus on Crete.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorothea was amazed to think of the
bird-like speed with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind was surveying the ground where it
had been creeping for years. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Close the book now, my dear. We will resume our work to-morrow. I
have deferred it too long, and would gladly see it completed. But you
observe that the principle on which my selection is made, is to give
adequate, and not disproportionate illustration to each of the theses
enumerated in my introduction, as at present sketched. You have
perceived that distinctly, Dorothea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rather tremulously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sick at heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now I think that I can take some repose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
laid down again and begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to put out the lights. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
lain down too, and there was a darkness only broken by a dull glow on
the hearth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before I sleep, I have a request to make, Dorothea.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with dread in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is that you will let me know, deliberately, whether, in case of my
death, you will carry out my wishes: whether you will avoid doing what
I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was not taken by surprise: many incidents had been leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
to the conjecture of some intention on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's part which might
make a new yoke for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not answer immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You refuse?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon, with more edge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I do not yet refuse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a clear voice, the need of
freedom asserting itself within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but it is too solemn--I think it
is not right--to make a promise when I am ignorant what it will bind me
to. Whatever affection prompted I would do without promising.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you would use your own judgment: I ask you to obey mine; you
refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, beseechingly, crushed by opposing fears.
<div class="bookquote">``But may I wait and reflect a little while? I desire with my whole
soul to do what will comfort you; but I cannot give any pledge
suddenly--still less a pledge to do I know not what.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot then confide in the nature of my wishes?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grant me till to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, beseechingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Till to-morrow then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Casaubon.

<p/>Soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was sleeping, but there was no more sleep
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). While she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) constrained herself to lie still lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should
disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind was carrying on a conflict in which imagination
ranged its forces first on one side and then on the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had no
presentiment that the power which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband wished to establish over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) future action had relation to anything else than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work. But it
was clear enough to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to devote herself to
sifting those mixed heaps of material, which were to be the doubtful
illustration of principles still more doubtful. The poor child had
become altogether unbelieving as to the trustworthiness of that Key
which had made the ambition and the labor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's life. It
was not wonderful that, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) small instruction, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) judgment
in this matter was truer than his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>): for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked with unbiassed
comparison and healthy sense at probabilities on which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had risked
all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) egoism. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pictured to herself the days, and months,
and years which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must spend in sorting what might be called
shattered mummies, and fragments of a tradition which was itself a
mosaic wrought from crushed ruins--sorting them as food for a theory
which was already withered in the birth like an elfin child. Doubtless
a vigorous error vigorously pursued has kept the embryos of truth
a-breathing: the quest of gold being at the same time a questioning of
substances, the body of chemistry is prepared for its soul, and
Lavoisier is born. But Mr. Casaubon's theory of the elements which
made the seed of all tradition was not likely to bruise itself unawares
against discoveries: it floated among flexible conjectures no more
solid than those etymologies which seemed strong because of likeness in
sound until it was shown that likeness in sound made them impossible:
it was a method of interpretation which was not tested by the necessity
of forming anything which had sharper collisions than an elaborate
notion of Gog and Magog: it was as free from interruption as a plan for
threading the stars together. And Dorothea had so often had to check
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) weariness and impatience over this questionable riddle-guessing, as
it revealed itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) instead of the fellowship in high knowledge
which was to make life worthier! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could understand well enough now
why her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband had come to cling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), as possibly the only hope
left that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) labors would ever take a shape in which they could be
given to the world. At first it had seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wished to keep even
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) aloof from any close knowledge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was doing; but gradually
the terrible stringency of human need--the prospect of a too speedy
death--

<p/>And here Dorothea's pity turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own future to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
past--nay, to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) present hard struggle with a lot which had grown out
of that past: the lonely labor, the ambition breathing hardly under the
pressure of self-distrust; the goal receding, and the heavier limbs;
and now at last the sword visibly trembling above him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)! And had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) not
wished to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might help him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life's labor?--But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had thought the work was to be something greater, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could
serve in devoutly for its own sake. Was it right, even to soothe his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
grief--would it be possible, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) promised--to work as in a
treadmill fruitlessly?

<p/>And yet, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) deny him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)? Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``I refuse to content this
pining hunger?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It would be refusing to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dead, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
almost sure to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) living. If he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived as Lydgate had said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
might, for fifteen years or more, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life would certainly be spent in
helping him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).

<p/>Still, there was a deep difference between that devotion to the living
and that indefinite promise of devotion to the dead. While he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could claim nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would not still be free to remonstrate
against, and even to refuse. But--the thought passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind
more than once, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not believe in it--might he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not mean
to demand something more from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been able to imagine,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pledge to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wishes without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
exactly what they were? No; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart was bound up in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) work only:
that was the end for which his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) failing life was to be eked out by hers.

<p/>And now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were to say, <div class="bookquote">``No! if you die, I will put no finger to
your work'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would be crushing that bruised heart.

<p/>For four hours Dorothea lay in this conflict, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt ill and
bewildered, unable to resolve, praying mutely. Helpless as a child
which has sobbed and sought too long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fell into a late morning
sleep, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) waked Mr. Casaubon was already up. Tantripp told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had read prayers, breakfasted, and was in the library.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never saw you look so pale, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>said Tantripp, a solid-figured
woman who had been with the sisters at Lausanne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I ever high-colored, Tantripp?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, smiling faintly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, not to say high-colored, but with a bloom like a Chiny rose.
But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest
a little this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able to
go into that close library.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, no! let me make haste,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Casaubon wants me
particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went down she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should promise to fulfil his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
wishes; but that would be later in the day--not yet.

<p/>As Dorothea entered the library, Mr. Casaubon turned round from the
table where he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been placing some books, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was waiting for your appearance, my dear. I had hoped to set to
work at once this morning, but I find myself under some indisposition,
probably from too much excitement yesterday. I am going now to take a
turn in the shrubbery, since the air is milder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``Your mind, I feared, was too
active last night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would fain have it set at rest on the point I last spoke of,
Dorothea. You can now, I hope, give me an answer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I come out to you in the garden presently?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, winning
a little breathing space in that way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be in the Yew-tree Walk for the next half-hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Casaubon, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>Dorothea, feeling very weary, rang and asked Tantripp to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) some
wraps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been sitting still for a few minutes, but not in any
renewal of the former conflict: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) simply felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to
say <div class="bookquote">``Yes''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own doom: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was too weak, too full of dread at the
thought of inflicting a keen-edged blow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, to do anything
but submit completely. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat still and let Tantripp put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
bonnet and shawl, a passivity which was unusual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) liked
to wait on herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>said Tantripp, with an irrepressible movement
of love towards the beautiful, gentle creature for whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt unable
to do anything more, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had finished tying the bonnet.

<p/>This was too much for Dorothea's highly-strung feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) burst
into tears, sobbing against Tantripp's arm. But soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) checked
herself, dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes, and went out at the glass door into the
shrubbery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish every book in that library was built into a caticom for your
master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>said Tantripp to Pratt, the butler, finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) in the
breakfast-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been at Rome, and visited the antiquities, as
we know; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) always declined to call Mr. Casaubon anything but
<div class="bookquote">``your master,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Casaubon/Casaubon/MR. CASAUBON</b></font>)</div>when speaking to the other servants.

<p/>Pratt laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) master very well, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) liked Tantripp
better.

<p/>When Dorothea was out on the gravel walks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lingered among the
nearer clumps of trees, hesitating, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had done once before, though
from a different cause. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had feared lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) effort at
fellowship should be unwelcome; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dreaded going to the spot where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) foresaw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must bind herself to a fellowship from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
shrank. Neither law nor the world's opinion compelled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to
this--only her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's nature and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own compassion, only the ideal
and not the real yoke of marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw clearly enough the whole
situation, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was fettered: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not smite the stricken soul
that entreated hers. If that were weakness, Dorothea was weak. But
the half-hour was passing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must not delay longer. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
entered the Yew-tree Walk she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband; but the walk
had bends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went, expecting to catch sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) figure wrapped
in a blue cloak, which, with a warm velvet cap, was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) outer garment
on chill days for the garden. It occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might be
resting in the summer-house, towards which the path diverged a little.
Turning the angle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seated on the bench, close to a
stone table. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms were resting on the table, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brow was
bowed down on them, the blue cloak being dragged forward and screening
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face on each side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) exhausted himself last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea said to herself, thinking
at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was asleep, and that the summer-house was too damp a
place to rest in. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) remembered that of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) take that attitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was reading to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) found it
easier than any other; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would sometimes speak, as well as
listen, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) face down in that way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went into the summerhouse
and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am come, Edward; I am ready.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) took no notice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must be fast asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulder, and repeated, <div class="bookquote">``I am ready!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
motionless; and with a sudden confused fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) leaned down to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
took off his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) velvet cap, and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheek close to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) head, crying
in a distressed tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wake, dear, wake! Listen to me. I am come to answer.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But Dorothea
never gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) answer.

<p/>Later in the day, Lydgate was seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bedside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
talking deliriously, thinking aloud, and recalling what had gone
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind the night before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
name, but appeared to think it right that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should explain everything
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); and again, and again, begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to explain everything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) soon: I am ready to promise. Only,
thinking about it was so dreadful--it has made me ill. Not very ill.
I shall soon be better. Go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>But the silence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's ear was never more to be broken.



<p/>CHAPTER XLIX.

<p/>A task too strong for wizard spells
This squire had brought about;
<div class="bookquote">``T is easy dropping stones in wells,
But who shall get them out?''


 (<font color='red'><b>This squire</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to God we could hinder Dorothea from knowing this,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James Chettam, with a little frown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) brow, and an expression of
intense disgust about his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) mouth.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) was standing on the hearth-rug in the library at Lowick Grange, and
speaking to Mr. Brooke. It was the day after Mr. Casaubon had been
buried, and Dorothea was not yet able to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be difficult, you know, Chettam, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) is an executrix,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) likes to go into these things--property, land, that kind of
thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) notions, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
eye-glasses on nervously, and exploring the edges of a folded paper
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would like to act--depend upon it,
as an executrix Dorothea would want to act. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was twenty-one
last December, you know. I can hinder nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James looked at the carpet for a minute in silence, and then
lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eyes suddenly fixed them on Mr. Brooke, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I will
tell you what we can do. Until Dorothea is well, all business must be
kept from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) is able to be moved she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must come to
us. Being with Celia and the baby will be the best thing in the world
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>), and will pass away the time. And meanwhile you must get rid
of Ladislaw: you must send him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) out of the country.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Here Sir James's
look of disgust returned in all its intensity.

<p/>Mr. Brooke put his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), walked to the window and
straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) back with a little shake before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is easily said, Chettam, easily said, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>persisted Sir James, restraining his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) indignation within
respectful forms, <div class="bookquote">``it was you who brought him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) here, and you who keep
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) here--I mean by the occupation you give him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but I can't dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in an instant without assigning reasons,
my dear Chettam. Ladislaw has been invaluable, most satisfactory. I
consider that I have done this part of the country a service by
bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)--by bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke ended with a nod,
turning round to give it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a pity this part of the country didn't do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), that's all
I have to say about it. At any rate, as Dorothea's brother-in-law, I
feel warranted in objecting strongly to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) being kept here by any
action on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends. You admit, I hope, that I have a
right to speak about what concerns the dignity of my wife's sister?''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James was getting warm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, my dear Chettam, of course. But you and I have different
ideas--different--''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not about this action of Casaubon's, I should hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>interrupted Sir
James. <div class="bookquote">``I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has most unfairly compromised Dorothea. I say
that there never was a meaner, more ungentlemanly action than this--a
codicil of this sort to a will which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) made at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
marriage with the knowledge and reliance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) family--a positive
insult to Dorothea!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Casaubon was a little twisted about Ladislaw.
Ladislaw has told me the reason--dislike of the bent he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) took, you
know--Ladislaw didn't think much of Casaubon's notions, Thoth and
Dagon--that sort of thing: and I fancy that Casaubon didn't like the
independent position Ladislaw had taken up. I saw the letters between
them, you know. Poor Casaubon was a little buried in books--he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) didn't
know the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well for Ladislaw to put that color on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James. <div class="bookquote">``But I believe Casaubon was only jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) on Dorothea's
account, and the world will suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) some reason; and
that is what makes it so abominable--coupling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) name with this young
fellow's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Chettam, it won't lead to anything, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Brooke, seating himself and sticking on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass again. ``It's all
of a piece with Casaubon's oddity. This paper, now, ``Synoptical
Tabulation' and so on, `for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,<div class="bookquote">'' it was locked up
in the desk with the will. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) meant Dorothea to publish his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
researches, eh? and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)'ll do it, you know; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has gone into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
studies uncommonly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Casaubon</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``that is neither here nor
there. The question is, whether you don't see with me the propriety of
sending young Ladislaw away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, no, not the urgency of the thing. By-and-by, perhaps, it may
come round. As to gossip, you know, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) away won't hinder
gossip. People say what they like to say, not what they have chapter
and verse for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr</b></font>)</div>said Mr Brooke, becoming acute about the truths that
lay on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own wishes. ``I might get rid of Ladislaw up to
a certain point--take away the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer' from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), and that sort of
thing; but I couldn't send him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) out of the country if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) didn't choose
to go--didn't choose, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke, persisting as quietly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) were only discussing the
nature of last year's weather, and nodding at the end with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) usual
amenity, was an exasperating form of obstinacy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with as much passion as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ever showed,
<div class="bookquote">``let us get him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a post; let us spend money on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could go in
the suite of some Colonial Governor! Grampus might take him (<font color='blue'><b>Governor</b></font>)--and I
could write to Fulke about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Ladislaw won't be shipped off like a head of cattle, my dear
fellow; Ladislaw has his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) ideas. It's my opinion that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) were to
part from me to-morrow, you'd only hear the more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) in the country.
With his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) talent for speaking and drawing up documents, there are few
men who could come up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) as an agitator--an agitator, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Agitator!''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with bitter emphasis, feeling that the
syllables of this word properly repeated were a sufficient exposure of
its hatefulness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But be reasonable, Chettam. Dorothea, now. As you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
better go to Celia as soon as possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) can stay under your roof,
and in the mean time things may come round quietly. Don't let us be
firing off our guns in a hurry, you know. Standish will keep our
counsel, and the news will be old before it's known. Twenty things may
happen to carry off Ladislaw--without my doing anything, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am to conclude that you decline to do anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Decline, Chettam?--no--I didn't say decline. But I really don't see

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to hear it!''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) irritation making him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
forget himself a little. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure Casaubon was not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it would have been worse if he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had made the codicil to hinder
her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) from marrying again at all, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been less
indelicate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of poor Casaubon's freaks! That attack upset his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) brain a little.
It all goes for nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) doesn't _want_ to marry Ladislaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this codicil is framed so as to make everybody believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>)
did. I don't believe anything of the sort about Dorothea,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James--then frowningly, <div class="bookquote">``but I suspect Ladislaw. I tell you frankly,
I suspect Ladislaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't take any immediate action on that ground, Chettam. In
fact, if it were possible to pack him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) off--send him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to Norfolk
Island--that sort of thing--it would look all the worse for Dorothea
to those who knew about it. It would seem as if we distrusted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--distrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>That Mr. Brooke had hit on an undeniable argument, did not tend to
soothe Sir James. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hand to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hat, implying that
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not mean to contend further, and said, still with some heat--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I can only say that I think Dorothea was sacrificed once,
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends were too careless. I shall do what I can, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
brother, to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do better than get her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to Freshitt as soon as possible,
Chettam. I approve that plan altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, well
pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had won the argument. It would have been highly
inconvenient to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) to part with Ladislaw at that time, when a
dissolution might happen any day, and electors were to be convinced of
the course by which the interests of the country would be best served.
Mr. Brooke sincerely believed that this end could be secured by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own
return to Parliament: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) offered the forces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind honestly to the
nation.

<p/>Dorothea had been safe at Freshitt Hall nearly a week before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
asked any dangerous questions. Every morning now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat with Celia in
the prettiest of up-stairs sitting-rooms, opening into a small
conservatory--Celia all in white and lavender like a bunch of mixed
violets, watching the remarkable acts of the baby, which were so
dubious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) inexperienced mind that all conversation was interrupted
by appeals for their interpretation made to the oracular nurse.
Dorothea sat by in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) widow's dress, with an expression which rather
provoked Celia, as being much too sad; for not only was baby quite
well, but really when a husband had been so dull and troublesome while
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived, and besides that had--well, well! Sir James, of course, had
told Celia everything, with a strong representation how important it
was that Dorothea should not know it sooner than was inevitable.

<p/>But Mr. Brooke had been right in predicting that Dorothea would not
long remain passive where action had been assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew the
purport of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's will made at the time of their marriage, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was clearly conscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) position, was
silently occupied with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ought to do as the owner of Lowick
Manor with the patronage of the living attached to it.

<p/>One morning when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle paid his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) usual visit, though with an unusual
alacrity in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) accounted for by saying that it was now
pretty certain Parliament would be dissolved forthwith, Dorothea said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle, it is right now that I should consider who is to have the
living at Lowick. After Mr. Tucker had been provided for, I never
heard my husband say that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had any clergyman in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind as a
successor to himself. I think I ought to have the keys now and go to
Lowick to examine all my husband's papers. There may be something that
would throw light on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No hurry, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, quietly. <div class="bookquote">``By-and-by, you know,
you can go, if you like. But I cast my eyes over things in the desks
and drawers--there was nothing--nothing but deep subjects, you
know--besides the will. Everything can be done by-and-by. As to the
living, I have had an application for interest already--I should say
rather good. Mr. Tyke has been strongly recommended to me--I had
something to do with getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>) an appointment before. An apostolic
man, I believe--the sort of thing that would suit you, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to have fuller knowledge about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), uncle, and judge for
myself, if Mr. Casaubon has not left any expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wishes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
has perhaps made some addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will--there may be some
instructions for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, who had all the while had this
conjecture in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind with relation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing about the rectory, my dear--nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, rising
to go away, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) nieces: <div class="bookquote">``nor about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
researches, you know. Nothing in the will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>nieces</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's lip quivered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, you must not think of these things yet, my dear. By-and-by, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite well now, uncle; I wish to exert myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we shall see. But I must run away now--I have no end of
work now--it's a crisis--a political crisis, you know. And here is
Celia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) little man--you are an aunt, you know, now, and I am a
sort of grandfather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with placid hurry, anxious to
get away and tell Chettam that it would not be his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. Brooke's-RRB- fault
if Dorothea insisted on looking into everything.

<p/>Dorothea sank back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) chair when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had left the room, and
cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes down meditatively on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) crossed hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look, Dodo! look at him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)! Did you ever see anything like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said
Celia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) comfortable staccato.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Kitty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes rather absently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? why, his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) upper lip; see how he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) is drawing it down, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>)
meant to make a face. Isn't it wonderful! He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) may have his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) little
thoughts. I wish nurse were here. Do look at him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>A large tear which had been for some time gathering, rolled down
Dorothea's cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked up and tried to smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be sad, Dodo; kiss baby. What are you brooding over so? I am
sure you did everything, and a great deal too much. You should be
happy now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder if Sir James would drive me to Lowick. I want to look over
everything--to see if there were any words written for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has not
said so yet -LRB-here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the
gallery-RRB-. Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,
Dodo--I can see that: it vexes me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where am I wrong, Kitty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, quite meekly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was almost
ready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering
with some fear what her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) wrong notion was. Celia felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) advantage,
and was determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>)
did, or knew how to manage her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>). Since Celia's baby was born, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had
had a new sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed
clear that where there was a baby, things were right enough, and that
error, in general, was a mere lack of that central poising force.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said
Celia. <div class="bookquote">``You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable
for you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had
not been uncomfortable enough before. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) doesn't deserve it, and
you will find that out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has behaved very badly. James is as angry
with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, entreatingly, <div class="bookquote">``you distress me. Tell me at
once what you mean.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>It glanced through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind that Mr. Casaubon
had left the property away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--which would not be so very
distressing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has made a codicil to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will, to say the property was all to
go away from you if you married--I mean--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is of no consequence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia went on with
persevering quietude. <div class="bookquote">``Of course that is of no consequence in one
way--you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse
of Mr. Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The blood rushed to Dorothea's face and neck painfully. But Celia was
administering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking
up notions that had done Dodo's health so much harm. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) went on in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) neutral tone, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) had been remarking on baby's robes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``James says so. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman.
And there never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr.
Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.
Ladislaw--which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.
Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money--just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ever
would think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as
well marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at
baby,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light
shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>), and tripping away.

<p/>Dorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back
helplessly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have compared her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience at
that moment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life was
taking on a new form, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was undergoing a metamorphosis in which
memory would not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs.
Everything was changing its aspect: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's conduct, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
duteous feeling towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), every struggle between them--and yet
more, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole relation to Will Ladislaw. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) world was in a state of
convulsive change; the only thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could say distinctly to herself
was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must wait and think anew. One change terrified her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as if
it had been a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
departed husband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting
everything she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said and did. Then again she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was conscious of another
change which also made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning
of heart towards Will Ladislaw. It had never before entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could, under any circumstances, be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lover: conceive the
effect of the sudden revelation that another had thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in that
light--that perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) himself had been conscious of such a
possibility,--and this with the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting
conditions, and questions not soon to be solved.

<p/>It seemed a long while--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not know how long--before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heard
Celia saying, <div class="bookquote">``That will do, nurse; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will be quiet on my lap now.
You can go to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What I
think, Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea
was leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) chair, and likely to be passive, <div class="bookquote">``is that Mr.
Casaubon was spiteful. I never did like him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), and James never did. I
think the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
has behaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to
make yourself uncomfortable about him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) has been taken away, that
is a mercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should
we, baby?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and
poise of the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even
to the nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cap off, to
make--you didn't know what:--in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was Bouddha in a Western
form.

<p/>At this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
said was, <div class="bookquote">``I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have
you been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorothea's hand was
of a marble coldness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
ought not, ought she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, looking at
Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what
would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) the most repose of mind. That repose will not always
come from being forbidden to act.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, exerting herself, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure that is wise.
There are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit
here idle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) agitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``You know every one in Middlemarch,
I think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have
serious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.
Tyke and all the--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Dorothea's effort was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
broke off and burst into sobs. Lydgate made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) drink a dose of sal
volatile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) likes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said to Sir James, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
asked to see before quitting the house. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wants perfect freedom, I
think, more than any other prescription.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) attendance on Dorothea while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) brain was excited, had enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
to form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been suffering from the strain and conflict of
self-repression; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was likely now to feel herself only in
another sort of pinfold than that from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been released.

<p/>Lydgate's advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
found that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about
the will. There was no help for it now--no reason for any further
delay in the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir
James complied at once with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) request that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to
Lowick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no wish to stay there at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea; <div class="bookquote">``I could
hardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be
able to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at
it from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little
while with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the
people in the village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are
better out of the way of such doings,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, who at that
moment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw's.
But no word passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) and Dorothea about the objectionable
part of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it
between them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,
about disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have
chosen to say, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband's injustice. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did wish that Sir James could know what
had passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband about Will Ladislaw's moral
claim on the property: it would then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought, be apparent to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
as it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's strange indelicate proviso had
been chiefly urged by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and
not merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it
must be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will's
sake, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends seemed to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as simply an object of
Mr. Casaubon's charity. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) be compared with an Italian
carrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed
like a mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.

<p/>At Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer--searched all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
places of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed
especially to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), except that <div class="bookquote">``Synoptical Tabulation,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>which was
probably only the beginning of many intended directions for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
guidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all
else, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan
of transmitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) work, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had been in executing it, by the sense
of moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea's
competence to arrange what he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had prepared was subdued only by distrust
of any other redactor. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had come at last to create a trust for
himself out of Dorothea's nature: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resolved to do:
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) willingly imagined her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) toiling under the fetters of a promise to
erect a tomb with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) name upon it. -LRB-Not that Mr. Casaubon called the
future volumes a tomb; he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) called them the Key to all Mythologies.-RRB- But
the months gained on him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and left his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) plans belated: he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had only had
time to ask for that promise by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sought to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cold grasp
on Dorothea's life.

<p/>The grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
judgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of
faithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) judgment, instead of
being controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the
imbittering discovery that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) past union there had lurked the
hidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man
was no longer before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pity: there remained only the
retrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been
lower than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had
even blinded his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scrupulous care for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own character, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
defeat his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the
property which was the sign of that broken tie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have been
glad to be free from it and have nothing more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) original fortune
which had been settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), if there had not been duties attached to
ownership, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ought not to flinch from. About this property
many troublous questions insisted on rising: had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) not been right in
thinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?--but was it
not impossible now for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had
taken a cruelly effective means of hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): even with indignation
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) purpose revolted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>After collecting papers of business which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wished to examine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
locked up again the desks and drawers--all empty of personal words for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--empty of any sign that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's lonely brooding his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heart
had gone out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in excuse or explanation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went back to
Freshitt with the sense that around his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last hard demand and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last
injurious assertion of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) power, the silence was unbroken.

<p/>Dorothea tried now to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thoughts towards immediate duties, and
one of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
of. Lydgate's ear had caught eagerly her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mention of the living, and as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of
making amends for the casting-vote he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had once given with an
ill-satisfied conscience. <div class="bookquote">``Instead of telling you anything about Mr.
Tyke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to speak of another man--Mr.
Farebrother, the Vicar of St. Botolph's. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) living is a poor one, and
gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) a stinted provision for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) family. His (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) mother,
aunt, and sister all live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>), and depend upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>). I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
has never married because of them. I never heard such good preaching
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)--such plain, easy eloquence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) would have done to preach at
St. Paul's Cross after old Latimer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Latimer</b></font>) talk is just as good about all
subjects: original, simple, clear. I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Latimer</b></font>) a remarkable fellow: he (<font color='blue'><b>Latimer</b></font>)
ought to have done more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Latimer</b></font>) has done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why has he (<font color='blue'><b>Latimer</b></font>) not done more?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, interested now in all who
had slipped below their own intention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a hard question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``I find myself that it's
uncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many
strings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has got into
the wrong profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) wants a wider range than that of a poor
clergyman, and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has no interest to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is very
fond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is
hampered in reconciling these tastes with his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) position. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has no
money to spare--hardly enough to use; and that has led him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) into
card-playing--Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) does play for
money, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) wins a good deal. Of course that takes him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) into company
a little beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>), and makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) slack about some things; and yet,
with all that, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) as a whole, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is one of the most
blameless men I ever knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has neither venom nor doubleness in him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>),
and those often go with a more correct outside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) suffers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) conscience because of that habit,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea; <div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) wishes he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) could leave it off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) would leave it off, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) were transplanted into
plenty: he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) would be glad of the time for other things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, meditatively. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was wishing it were possible to restore
the times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a
strong desire to rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) chance-gotten money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate.
<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is only a
parson among parishioners whose lives he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has to try and make better.
Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an
impatience of everything in which the parson doesn't cut the principal
figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good
deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>) doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people
uncomfortably aware of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tyke</b></font>). Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the
birds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our
farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into
a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at
Lowick--I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the
Apocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which
Christianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a
wider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest--I mean
that which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most
people as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than
to condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) preach.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``I trust to the effect of that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is very much
beloved, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) enemies too: there are always people who can't
forgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning
business is really a blot. You don't, of course, see many Middlemarch
people: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a
great friend of Mr. Farebrother's old ladies, and would be glad to sing
the Vicar's praises. One of the old ladies--Miss Noble, the aunt--is a
wonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw
gallants her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you
know Ladislaw's look--a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this
little old maid reaching up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) arm--they looked like a couple
dropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about
Farebrother is to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Happily Dorothea was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) private sitting-room when this conversation
occurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate's innocent
introduction of Ladislaw painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). As was usual with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in
matters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond's
remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
had purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the
Vicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.
Casaubon's death he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had heard no rumor
to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) that Mr. Brooke's confidential secretary was a dangerous
subject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) was gone, his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) picture of Ladislaw
lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind and disputed the ground with that question of the
Lowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
hear of that fact which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cheeks burn as they never used to do?
And how would he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) feel when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) heard it?--But she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) could see as well as
possible how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with
white mice!--on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was a creature who entered into every
one's feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of
urging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own with iron resistance.



<p/>CHAPTER LI.

<p/>Party is Nature too, and you shall see
By force of Logic how they both agree:
The Many in the One, the One in Many;
All is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:
Genus holds species, both are great or small;
One genus highest, one not high at all;
Each species has its differentia too,
This is not That, and He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was never You,
Though this and that are AYES, and you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
Are like as one to one, or three to three.


<p/>No gossip about Mr. Casaubon's will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air
seemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming
election, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter
of itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice
of. The famous <div class="bookquote">``dry election''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>was at hand, in which the depths of
public feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will
Ladislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea's
widowhood was continually in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was so far from wishing to
be spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) out to tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) what had passed about the Lowick living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) answered rather
waspishly--

<p/>``Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,
and am not likely to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), since she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is at Freshitt. I never go
there. It is Tory ground, where I and the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer' are no more
welcome than a poacher and his (<font color='blue'><b>poacher</b></font>) gun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>The fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing
that Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), as before, to come to the
Grange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to
contrive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) should go there as little as possible. This was a
shuffling concession of Mr. Brooke's to Sir James Chettam's indignant
remonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,
concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea's
account. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends, then, regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) with some suspicion? Their
fears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they
imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying
to win the favor of a rich woman.

<p/>Until now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and
Dorothea--until now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) was come to the brink of it, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) on
the other side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) began, not without some inward rage, to think of
going away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) to
show any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to
disagreeable imputations--perhaps even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind, which others might
try to poison.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are forever divided,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``I might as well be at Rome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
would be no farther from me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But what we call our despair is often
only the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons
why he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) should not go--public reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) should not quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) post at
this crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) needed <div class="bookquote">``coaching''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and
indirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own
chessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,
even if his (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a
gentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr.
Brooke and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) steadily to the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) must pledge himself to
vote for the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
independence and power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task.
Mr. Farebrother's prophecy of a fourth candidate <div class="bookquote">``in the bag''  (<font color='red'><b>a candidate</b></font>)</div>had not
yet been fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any
other power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy
nodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate
like Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) own expense; and the
fight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the
new Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future
independent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.
Mr. Hawley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) party would bend all their forces to the return of
Pinkerton, and Mr. Brooke's success must depend either on plumpers
which would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory
votes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be
preferable.

<p/>This prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.
Brooke: his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) impression that waverers were likely to be allured by
wavering statements, and also the liability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) mind to stick afresh
at opposing arguments as they turned up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) memory, gave Will
Ladislaw much trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know there are tactics in these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke; ``meeting
people half-way--tempering your ideas--saying, ``Well now, there's
something in that,<div class="bookquote">'' and so on. I agree with you that this is a
peculiar occasion--the country with a will of its own--political
unions--that sort of thing--but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp
a knife, Ladislaw. These ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw
the line somewhere--yes: but why just at ten? That's a difficult
question, now, if you go into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``But if you are to wait
till we get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a
revolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As
for trimming, this is not a time for trimming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval
the wisdom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) own methods reasserted itself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) was again drawn
into using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) was
in excellent spirits, which even supported him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) under large advances of
money; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelley</b></font>) powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been
tested by anything more difficult than a chairman's speech introducing
other orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>)
came away with a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) was a tactician by nature, and that it
was a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) was a
little conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief
representative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail
trader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the
borough--willing for his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) own part to supply an equal quality of teas
and sugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree
impartially with both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this
necessity of electing members was a great burthen to a town; for even
if there were no danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand,
there would be the painful necessity at last of disappointing
respectable people whose names were on his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) books. He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was accustomed to
receive large orders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were
many of Pinkerton's committee whose opinions had a great weight of
grocery on their side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not
too <div class="bookquote">``clever in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) intellects,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>was the more likely to forgive a grocer
who gave a hostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
back parlor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said, rattling the
small silver in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pocket, and smiling affably. ``Will it support Mrs.
Mawmsey, and enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) to bring up six children when I am no more? I
put the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very
well, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when
gentlemen come to me and say, ``Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote
against us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor
I like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining
tradesmen of the right color.<div class="bookquote">'' Those very words have been spoken to
me, sir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don't mean by
your honorable self, Mr. Brooke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>tradesmen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no--that's narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me
of your goods, Mr. Mawmsey,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, <div class="bookquote">``until I hear
that you send bad sugars, spices--that sort of thing--I shall never
order him (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) to go elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mawmsey/Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Mawmsey,
feeling that politics were clearing up a little. <div class="bookquote">``There would be some
pleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable manner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put
yourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by--a
thoroughly popular measure--a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come
first before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you've
got to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.
We're all one family, you know--it's all one cupboard. Such a thing
as a vote, now: why, it may help to make men's fortunes at the
Cape--there's no knowing what may be the effect of a vote,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke
ended, with a sense of being a little out at sea, though finding it
still enjoyable. But Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, sir, but I can't afford that. When I give a vote I
must know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on
my till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I'll admit, are
what nobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you've
bought in currants, which are a goods that will not keep--I've never;
myself seen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human
pride. But as to one family, there's debtor and creditor, I hope;
they're not going to reform that away; else I should vote for things
staying as they are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I
have, personally speaking--that is, for self and family. I am not one
of those who have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in
parish and private business, and noways in respect of your honorable
self and custom, which you was good enough to say you would not
withdraw from me, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was
satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Mawmsey/Mawmsey</b></font>)</div><p/>After this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) wife
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mawmsey</b></font>) had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>)
didn't mind so much now about going to the poll.

<p/>Mr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) tactics to
Ladislaw, who for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) part was glad enough to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
had no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative
sort, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,
necessarily, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) agents, who understood the nature of the
Middlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ignorance on the side
of the Bill--which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it
on the side against the Bill. Will stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ears. Occasionally
Parliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,
could hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.
There were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty
business; and Will protested to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) share in bringing Mr.
Brooke through would be quite innocent.

<p/>But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) should succeed in that mode of contributing to the
majority on the right side was very doubtful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had written
out various speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had begun to
perceive that Mr. Brooke's mind, if it had the burthen of remembering
any train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and
not easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of
serving your country, and to remember the contents of a document is
another. No! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into
thinking of the right arguments at the right time was to be well plied
with them till they took up all the room in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) brain. But here there
was the difficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in
beforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ideas stood rather in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) way when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was speaking.

<p/>However, Ladislaw's coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for
before the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the
worthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,
which looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,
commanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a
fine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some
prospect of an understanding between Bagster's committee and Brooke's,
to which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such
manufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which
almost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) associates who sat for
Pinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having
weakened the blasts of the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>against him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) reforms as a
landlord in the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) drove into the town, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) heart tolerably light under his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
buff-colored waistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it
often happens that all moments seem comfortably remote until the last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This looks well, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
have a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now--this kind of
public made up of one's own neighbors, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The weavers tanners</b></font>)</div><p/>The weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never
thought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had been sent in a box from London. But they listened
without much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,
one of them--a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell
Middlemarch its duty--spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think
what the candidate could find to say after him (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>). Meanwhile the crowd
became denser, and as the political personage neared the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>)
speech, Mr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) sensations while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
still handled his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass, trifled with documents before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>), and
exchanged remarks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) committee, as a man to whom the moment of
summons was indifferent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) said, with an easy
air, to Will, who was close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and presently handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) the
supposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an
abstemious man, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no
great interval from the first was a surprise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) system which tended
to scatter his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) energies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>): so
many English gentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on
entirely private grounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
country by standing for Parliament--which, indeed, may also be done on
private grounds, but being once undertaken does absolutely demand some
speechifying.

<p/>It was not about the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) speech that Mr. Brooke was at all
anxious; this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) felt sure, would be all right; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) should have it
quite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking
would be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was
alarming. <div class="bookquote">``And questions, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the demon</b></font>)</div>hinted the demon just waking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>)
stomach, <div class="bookquote">``somebody may put questions about the schedules.--Ladislaw,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the demon</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) continued, aloud, <div class="bookquote">``just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite
loud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other
expressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish
-LRB-decidedly an old bird-RRB- observed in the ear next to him (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``This looks
dangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Still,
the cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable
than Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) breast-pocket, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) left
hand on the rail of the balcony, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) right trifling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
eye-glass. The striking points in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) appearance were his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) buff
waistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) began
with some confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen--Electors of Middlemarch!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed
natural.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm uncommonly glad to be here--I was never so proud and happy in my
life--never so happy, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,
unhappily, the pat opening had slipped away--even couplets from Pope
may be but <div class="bookquote">``fallings from us, vanishings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pope</b></font>)</div>when fear clutches us, and a
glass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who
stood at the window behind the speaker, thought, <div class="bookquote">``it's all up now. The
only chance is that, since the best thing won't always do, floundering
may answer for once.''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,
fell back on himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) qualifications--always an appropriate
graceful subject for a candidate.

<p/>``I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends--you've known me on
the bench a good while--I've always gone a good deal into public
questions--machinery, now, and machine-breaking--you're many of you
concerned with machinery, and I've been going into that lately. It
won't do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on--trade,
manufactures, commerce, interchange of staples--that kind of
thing--since Adam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the
globe:--``Observation with extensive view,<div class="bookquote">'' must look everywhere, `from
China to Peru,''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>as somebody says--Johnson, I think, <div class="bookquote">``The Rambler,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>you
know. That is what I have done up to a certain point--not as far as
Peru; but I've not always stayed at home--I saw it wouldn't do. I've
been in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go--and then,
again, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.''

<p/>Plying among his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnson</b></font>) recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got
along, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest
seas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the
enemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders
of the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>),
the effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral
physiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the
air, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at
the opposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either
blank, or filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an
impish mockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and
this echo was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the
precision of a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it
overtook. By the time it said, <div class="bookquote">``The Baltic, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the audience</b></font>)</div>the laugh which had
been running through the audience became a general shout, and but for
the sobering effects of party and that great public cause which the
entanglement of things had identified with <div class="bookquote">``Brooke of Tipton,''  (<font color='red'><b>party</b></font>)</div>the
laugh might have caught his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked,
reprehensively, what the new police was doing; but a voice could not
well be collared, and an attack on the effigy of the candidate would
have been too equivocal, since Hawley probably meant it to be pelted.

<p/>Mr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of
anything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had
even a little singing in the ears, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was the only person who had
not yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of
himself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than
anxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was at
this moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) lost exordium was coming back to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) from the Baltic.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That reminds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) went on, thrusting a hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) side-pocket,
with an easy air, <div class="bookquote">``if I wanted a precedent, you know--but we never want
a precedent for the right thing--but there is Chatham, now; I can't say
I should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) was not
a man of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a loud rough voice from the
crowd below.

<p/>Immediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,
repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>The laugh was louder
than ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,
heard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
interrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) replied with
amenity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we
meet for but to speak our minds--freedom of opinion, freedom of the
press, liberty--that kind of thing? The Bill, now--you shall have the
Bill'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass and take
the paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and
coming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a
seat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven
shillings, and fourpence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) eye-glass
fall, and looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) confusedly, saw the image of himself, which
had come nearer. The next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) saw it dolorously bespattered with
eggs. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) spirit rose a little, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) voice too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth--all that is very
well'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>--here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke's shoulder, as the
echo said, <div class="bookquote">``All that is very well;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>then came a hail of eggs, chiefly
aimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by
chance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;
whistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub
because there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice
would have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,
disagreeably anointed, stood his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ground no longer. The frustration
would have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and
boyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter <div class="bookquote">``can aver
that it endangered the learned gentleman's ribs,''  (<font color='red'><b>the newspaper reporter</b></font>)</div>or can respectfully
bear witness to <div class="bookquote">``the soles of that gentleman's boots having been
visible above the railing,''  (<font color='red'><b>witness</b></font>)</div>has perhaps more consolations attached to
it.

<p/>Mr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
could, <div class="bookquote">``This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear
of the people by-and-by--but they didn't give me time. I should have
gone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) added, glancing at
Ladislaw. <div class="bookquote">``However, things will come all right at the nomination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on
the contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political
personage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) were brewing new
devices.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Bowyer who did it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish, evasively. <div class="bookquote">``I know it
as well as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowyer</b></font>) had been advertised. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bowyer</b></font>)'s uncommonly good at
ventriloquism, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bowyer</b></font>) did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has been
having him (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) to dinner lately: there's a fund of talent in Bowyer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, you never mentioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bowyer</b></font>) to me, Standish, else I would
have invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) to dine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a
great deal of inviting for the good of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said
Ladislaw, indignantly, <div class="bookquote">``but it seems as if the paltry fellows were
always to turn the scale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``principal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) went to shut himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) rooms with a
half-formed resolve to throw up the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Brooke together.
Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and
Dorothea were ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) going away
and getting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here
and slipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke's.
Then came the young dream of wonders that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) might do--in five years,
for example: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher
value now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they
might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) such distinction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would not seem to be asking
Dorothea to step down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>). Five years:--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could only be sure
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) more than for others; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could only make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) stood aloof until he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) love without lowering
himself--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could go away easily, and begin a career which at
five-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,
where talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could speak and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could write; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) could master any subject if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
chose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would carry all his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) ardor. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) not one day be
lifted above the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had won that
eminence well? Without doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) would leave Middlemarch, go to town,
and make himself fit for celebrity by <div class="bookquote">``eating his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) dinners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>celebrity</b></font>)</div><p/>But not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>)
and Dorothea. He (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) could not be satisfied until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew why, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>)
were the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would choose to marry, he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) would not marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Hence
he (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) must keep his (<font color='blue'><b>celebrity</b></font>) post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
in the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and
voices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a
stronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to
withdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) left the advantages
of his (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) canvassing machinery. He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) himself called this a strong measure,
but observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) health was less capable of sustaining excitement
than he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) had imagined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have felt uneasy about the chest--it won't do to carry that too
far,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. ``I must pull up.
Poor Casaubon was a warning, you know. I've made some heavy advances,
but I've dug a channel. It's rather coarse work--this electioneering,
eh, Ladislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a
channel with the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer'--put things in a track, and so on. A more
ordinary man than you might carry it on now--more ordinary, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish me to give it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, the quick color coming in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three

wish it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your
powers, you know. But about the ``Pioneer,<div class="bookquote">'' I have been consulting a
little with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take
it into their hands--indemnify me to a certain extent--carry it on, in
fact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up--might
find a better field. These people might not take that high view of you
which I have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand--though I
always looked forward to your doing something else. I think of having
a run into France. But I'll write you any letters, you know--to
Althorpe and people of that kind. I've met Althorpe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am exceedingly obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Ladislaw, proudly. ``Since you
are going to part with the ``Pioneer,<div class="bookquote">'' I need not trouble you about the
steps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>After Mr. Brooke had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) Will said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``The rest of the
family have been urging him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to get rid of me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doesn't care now
about my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own
movements and not because they are afraid of me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart
The lowliest duties on itself did lay.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wordsworth/WORDSWORTH</b></font>)</div>--WORDSWORTH.


<p/>On that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was to have the
Lowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the
portraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) mother left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tea and toast untouched, but sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) usual
pretty primness, only showing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) emotion by that flush in the cheeks
and brightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary
identity with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) far-off youthful self, and saying decisively--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come
after,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal
it. The gladness in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) face was of that active kind which seems to
have energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy
vision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
glances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went on, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands and looking at Miss Noble,
who was making tender little beaver-like noises, <div class="bookquote">``There shall be
sugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the
children, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make
presents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Noble nodded at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,
conscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket on the strength of the new preferment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As for you, Winny'' (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>--the Vicar went on--<div class="bookquote">``I shall make no difficulty
about your marrying any Lowick bachelor--Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for
example, as soon as I find you are in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Winifred, who had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) brother all the while and
crying heartily, which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) way of rejoicing, smiled through her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>)
tears and said, <div class="bookquote">``You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry
now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart. But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old
fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, rising, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) chair away and looking
down at himself. <div class="bookquote">``What do you say, mother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man
as your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Winifred</b></font>)</div>said Miss Winifred. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
would make us so lively at Lowick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like
poultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have
me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, not caring to specify.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We don't want everybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Winifred</b></font>)</div>said Miss Winifred. <div class="bookquote">``But _you_ would like
Miss Garth, mother, shouldn't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My son's choice shall be mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic
discretion, <div class="bookquote">``and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want
your whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was
a whist-player.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mrs. Farebrother always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) tiny old sister by
that magnificent name.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall do without whist now, mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement
for a good churchman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning
that whist had for her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some
dangerous countenancing of new doctrine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) had already said to Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel bound to give up St.
Botolph's. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to
reform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing
is not to give up power, but to use it well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have thought of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``So far as self is concerned,
I think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep
them. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I
felt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active
when the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) made no display of
humility on the subject, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) felt rather ashamed that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices
were free from.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
said to Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good
a clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point
of view, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
ended, smiling.

<p/>The Vicar did feel then as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) share of duties would be easy. But
Duty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly--something like a heavy
friend whom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) leg
within our gates.

<p/>Hardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) study under the
disguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
bachelor's degree.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, whose fair
open face was propitiating, <div class="bookquote">``but you are the only friend I can consult.
I told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can't
help coming to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Fred, I'm ready to hear and do anything I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the
Vicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you--''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred hesitated an instant and then went on
plungingly, <div class="bookquote">``I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I
may, I can't see anything else to do. I don't like it, but I know it's
uncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has spent a good deal
of money in educating me for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred paused again an instant, and
then repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and I can't see anything else to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now:
what are your other difficulties?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Merely that I don't like it. I don't like divinity, and preaching,
and feeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and
doing as other men do. I don't mean that I want to be a bad fellow in
any way; but I've no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a
clergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can't spare me any
capital, else I might go into farming. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has no room for me in
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trade. And of course I can't begin to study for law or physic now,
when my father wants me to earn something. It's all very well to say
I'm wrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well
tell me to go into the backwoods.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred's voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.
Farebrother might have been inclined to smile if his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) mind had not been
too busy in imagining more than Fred told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you any difficulties about doctrines--about the Articles?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
said, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred's sake.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any
arguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am
go in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me
to urge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, quite
simply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair
parish priest without being much of a divine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my
duty, though I mayn't like it. Do you think any body ought to blame
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on
your conscience, Fred--how far you have counted the cost, and seen what
your position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,
that I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is another hindrance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, coloring. <div class="bookquote">``I did not tell
you before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess
it. There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) ever since
we were children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Garth, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, examining some labels very
closely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. I shouldn't mind anything if she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would have me. And I know I
could be a good fellow then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) returns the feeling?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) never will say so; and a good while ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) made me promise not to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) about it again. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) has set her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) mind especially
against my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can't give her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) up. I
do think she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) said
that Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in
this way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the
subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--I mean about my going into the Church.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to
presuppose your attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and to enter on the subject as you
wish me to do, will be asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to tell me whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) returns it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is what I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to tell you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, bluntly. <div class="bookquote">``I don't
know what to do, unless I can get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the
Church?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mary said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never have me I might as well go wrong in one
way as another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don't
outlive the consequences of their recklessness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had
to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not be hurt at my intrusion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I feel sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) respects you more than any one, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not put you off with fun as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does me. Of course I could
not have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but
you. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, <div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
ought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to
believe that I would exert myself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a moment's silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) work,
and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) hand to Fred said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>That very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had just set up. <div class="bookquote">``Decidedly I am an old stalk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``the
young growths are pushing me aside.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals
on a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across
the grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
did not observe Mr. Farebrother's approach along the grass, and had
just stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would
persist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary
sprinkled them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the
forefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) brows and looked
embarrassed. <div class="bookquote">``Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary was saying in a
grave contralto. <div class="bookquote">``This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody
would think you were a silly young gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar,
within two yards of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>Mary started up and blushed. <div class="bookquote">``It always answers to reason with Fly,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, laughingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But not with young gentlemen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to
interest you in a young gentleman.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a silly one, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses
again, and feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart beat uncomfortably.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; though perhaps wisdom is not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) strong point, but rather
affection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two
qualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those
marks what young gentleman I mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, bravely, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face getting more serious,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands cold; <div class="bookquote">``it must be Fred Vincy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) has asked me to consult you about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) going into the Church. I
hope you will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising
to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, giving up the roses, and
folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arms, but unable to look up, <div class="bookquote">``whenever you have anything to
say to me I feel honored.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on
which your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very
evening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the
night of Featherstone's death--how you refused to burn the will; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
said that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had
been the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ten thousand
pounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may
relieve you on that score--may show you that no sin-offering is
demanded from you there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) meant to give
Fred his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) full advantage, but it would be well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) thought, to clear her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
mind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do
a man the wrong of marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as an act of atonement. Mary's cheeks
had begun to burn a little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was mute.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred's lot. I
find that the first will would not have been legally good after the
burning of the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed,
and you may be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score,
you may feel your mind free.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, earnestly. <div class="bookquote">``I am grateful to
you for remembering my feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) degree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has
worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) way so far, and now the question is, what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to do? That
question is so difficult that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is inclined to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father's
wishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
was quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) on the
subject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) being a
clergyman, as things go. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind to doing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were
fulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time--not,
of course, at first--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might be with me as my curate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would
have so much to do that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) stipend would be nearly what I used to get
as vicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all
this good cannot come to pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) heart to me, Miss
Garth, and asked me to plead for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). The condition lies entirely in
your feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary looked so much moved, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``Let us walk a
little;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and when they were walking he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``To speak quite plainly,
Fred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you
would consent to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wife; but with that prospect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) will try his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
best at anything you approve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wife, Mr. Farebrother:
but I certainly never will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wife if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) becomes a clergyman. What
you say is most generous and kind; I don't mean for a moment to correct
your judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of
looking at things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answer which only made its modesty more charming.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wishes me to report exactly what you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not love a man who is ridiculous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, not choosing to
go deeper. <div class="bookquote">``Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
respectable, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) likes, in some good worldly business, but I can
never imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,
and praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a
caricature. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) being a clergyman would be only for gentility's sake,
and I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile
gentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowse</b></font>) empty face and
neat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men
to represent Christianity--as if it were an institution for getting up
idiots genteelly--as if--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary checked herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been carried
along as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young women are severe: they don't feel the stress of action as men
do, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you
don't put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) has plenty of sense, but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would not show it
as a clergyman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would be a piece of professional affectation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) could have no
hope?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) braved all the difficulties of getting his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) bread in some
other way--will you give him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) the support of hope? May he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) count on
winning you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manner. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) ought not to put such questions until he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) has done
something worthy, instead of saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they
turned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy
walk, said, <div class="bookquote">``I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,
but either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining
another attachment, or it does not: either he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) may count on your
remaining single until he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) shall have earned your hand, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) may in any
case be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary--you know I used to catechise
you under that name--but when the state of a woman's affections touches
the happiness of another life--of more lives than one--I think it would
be the nobler course for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be perfectly direct and open.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother's manner
but at his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the
strange idea flashed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) words had reference to
himself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
never thought that any man could love her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) except Fred, who had espoused
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with the umbrella ring, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wore socks and little strapped
shoes; still less that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could be of any importance to Mr.
Farebrother, the cleverest man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) narrow circle. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only time
to feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was
clear and determined--her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I
have too strong a feeling for Fred to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) up for any one else. I
should never be quite happy if I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was unhappy for the loss of
me. It has taken such deep root in me--my gratitude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) for always
loving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time
when we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to
make that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) worthy
of every one's respect. But please tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) I will not promise to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is free to choose some one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother,
putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) hand to Mary, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall ride back to Middlemarch
forthwith. With this prospect before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), we shall get Fred into the
right niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God
bless you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes
filled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the
resolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother's manner, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
feel suddenly miserable, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had once felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father's
hands trembling in a moment of trouble.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear, no. I must get back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>In three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone
magnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of
whist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.



<p/>CHAPTER LIII.

<p/>It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from
what outsiders call inconsistency--putting a dead mechanism
of <div class="bookquote">``ifs''  (<font color='red'><b>outsiders</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``therefores''  (<font color='red'><b>outsiders</b></font>)</div>for the living myriad of hidden
suckers whereby the belief and the conduct are wrought into
mutual sustainment.


<p/>Mr. Bulstrode, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,
had naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thoroughly approved; and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) believed it to be a chastisement
and admonition directed to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own shortcomings and those of the nation
at large, that just about the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came in possession of the
deeds which made him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother
<div class="bookquote">``read himself''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>into the quaint little church and preached his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) first
sermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.
It was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to
reside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had bought the
excellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) might
gradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until
it should be conducive to the divine glory that he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) should enter on it
as a residence, partially withdrawing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) present exertions in the
administration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side
of Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which
Providence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A
strong leading in this direction seemed to have been given in the
surprising facility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected
that Mr. Rigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of
Eden. That was what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often,
in imagination, looked up through the sods above him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), and, unobstructed
by perspective, seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old
place to the perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.

<p/>But how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We
judge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always
open enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious
Joshua Rigg had not allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) parent to perceive that Stone Court was
anything less than the chief good in his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) estimation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had
certainly wished to call it his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) own. But as Warren Hastings looked at
gold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone
Court and thought of buying gold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had a very distinct and intense
vision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) chief good, the vigorous greed which he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had inherited
having taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) chief good
was to be a moneychanger. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) earliest employment as an
errand-boy in a seaport, he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had looked through the windows of the
moneychangers as other boys look through the windows of the
pastry-cooks; the fascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep
special passion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) meant, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had property, to do many things, one
of them being to marry a genteel young person; but these were all
accidents and joys that imagination could dispense with. The one joy
after which his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) soul thirsted was to have a money-changer's shop on a
much-frequented quay, to have locks all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) held the
keys, and to look sublimely cool as he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) handled the breeding coins of
all nations, while helpless Cupidity looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) enviously from the
other side of an iron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a
power enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it.
And when others were thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had settled at Stone Court for
life, Joshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joshua</b></font>) should settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in
safes and locks.

<p/>Enough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg's sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>)
land from Mr. Bulstrode's point of view, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) interpreted it as a
cheering dispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) had for some time entertained without external encouragement; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>)
interpreted it thus, but not too confidently, offering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>)
thanksgiving in guarded phraseology. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) doubts did not arise from the
possible relations of the event to Joshua Rigg's destiny, which
belonged to the unmapped regions not taken under the providential
government, except perhaps in an imperfect colonial way; but they arose
from reflecting that this dispensation too might be a chastisement for
himself, as Mr. Farebrother's induction to the living clearly was.

<p/>This was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of
deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>): it was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said to himself--it was as genuinely his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen
to disagree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). For the egoism which enters into our theories
does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is
satisfied, the more robust is our belief.

<p/>However, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,
hardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become
the proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were
worthy to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Peter/Peter Featherstone</b></font>)</div>had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of
conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned
on that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of
delight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof
that it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the
genuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,
<div class="bookquote">``Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the
almshouses after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div><p/>Affectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone
Court. Few days passed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) riding thither and looking over
some part of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious
in that quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending
forth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One
evening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in
golden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing
on horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had
met him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable
drainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more
than usually serene, under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) innocent recreation.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in
himself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when
the sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and
revive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be
held with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a
measure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are
peculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many
moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this
moment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of
far-off evenings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was a very young man and used to go out
preaching beyond Highbury. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would willingly have had that
service of exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still,
and so was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own facility in expounding them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brief reverie was
interrupted by the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback,
and was just shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) bridle before starting, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) exclaimed--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless my heart! what's this fellow in black coming along the lane?
He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s like one of those men one sees about after the races.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) horse and looked along the lane, but made no
reply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose
appearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of
black and a crape hat-band. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was within three yards of the horseman
now, and they could see the flash of recognition in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
whirled his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and
at last exclaiming:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, Nick, it's you! I couldn't be mistaken, though the
five-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,
eh? you didn't expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>To say that Mr. Raffles' manner was rather excited would be only one
mode of saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there
was a moment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hand coldly to Raffles and saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, adjusting
himself in a swaggering attitude. <div class="bookquote">``I came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) here before. I'm
not so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a
letter--what you may call a providential thing. It's uncommonly
fortunate I met you, though; for I don't care about seeing my stepson:
he (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>)'s not affectionate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>stepson</b></font>) poor mother's gone now. To tell the
truth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,
for--look here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) pocket.

<p/>Almost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger
on the spot for the sake of hearing all he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could about a man whose
acquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker's
life so unlike anything that was known of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in Middlemarch that they
must have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was
peculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were
almost absent from his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) mind; and one of these was curiosity about
personal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be
found out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had to tell anybody under him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) evil doings were
discovered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was more embarrassed than the culprit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) now spurred
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) horse, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must
be getting home,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>set off at a trot.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't put your full address to this letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>Raffles continued.
``That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ``The
Shrubs,<div class="bookquote">''--they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?--have cut
the London concern altogether--perhaps turned country squire--have a
rural mansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The
old lady must have been dead a pretty long while--gone to glory without
the pain of knowing how poor her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter was, eh? But, by Jove!
you're very pale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you're going home, I'll
walk by your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode's usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.
Five minutes before, the expanse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life had been submerged in its
evening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin
seemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation
an exercise of the closet, the bearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) deeds a matter of private
vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the
divine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red
figure had risen before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in unmanageable solidity--an incorporate
past which had not entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) imagination of chastisements. But
Mr. Bulstrode's thought was busy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was not a man to act or speak
rashly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going home,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I can defer my ride a little. And
you can, if you please, rest here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, making a grimace. <div class="bookquote">``I don't care now about
seeing my stepson. I'd rather go home with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>), is here no longer. I
am master here now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Raffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well then, I've no objection. I've had enough walking from
the coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I
like is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little
heavy in the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see
me, old fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) continued, as they turned towards the house. <div class="bookquote">``You
don't say so; but you never took your luck heartily--you were always
thinking of improving the occasion--you'd such a gift for improving
your luck.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) own wit, and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) leg in a
swaggering manner which was rather too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) companion's
judicious patience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I remember rightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, <div class="bookquote">``our
acquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are
now assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the
more readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did
not lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more
than twenty years of separation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my
heart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings
have ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you've got some in
the house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac
was not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint
of annoyance always served him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) as a fresh cue. But it was at least
clear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving
orders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a
resolute air of quietude.

<p/>There was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the
service of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode
entertained Raffles merely as a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) former master.

<p/>When there was food and drink spread before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) visitor in the
wainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly
enjoy each other's society. The wisest plan for both of us will
therefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you
wished to meet me, you probably considered that you had some business
to transact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to
remain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early
to-morrow morning--before breakfast, in fact, when I can receive any
Communication you have to make to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles; <div class="bookquote">``this is a comfortable place--a
little dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,
with this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the
morning. You're a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed
me a bit of a grudge for marrying his (<font color='blue'><b>Josh</b></font>) mother; and between you and me
there was never anything but kindness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and
sneering in Raffles' manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had
determined to wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was quite sober before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spent more words
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the
difficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be
permanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
wish to get rid of John Raffles, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) reappearance could not be
regarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might
have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to threaten Mr. Bulstrode's subversion as an instrument
of good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a
chastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) very
different from the hours in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) struggle had been securely
private, and which had ended with a sense that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) secret misdeeds were
pardoned and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) services accepted. Those misdeeds even when
committed--had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
desire to devote himself and all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) possessed to the furtherance of the
divine scheme? And was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) after all to become a mere stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence? For who would understand the work
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)? Who would not, when there was the pretext of casting
disgrace upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), confound his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) whole life and the truths he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
espoused, in one heap of obloquy?

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode's mind
clad his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman
ends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth's
orbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is
the stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the
automatic succession of theoretic phrases--distinct and inmost as the
shiver and the ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract
pain, was the forecast of disgrace in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) neighbors and
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of
disgrace, depends on the amount of previous profession. To men who
only aim at escaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner's dock is
disgrace. But Mr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.

<p/>It was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) again
reached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a
delightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in
flower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,
were running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around
had a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the
owner as he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of
Mr. Raffles, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was condemned to breakfast.

<p/>It was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted
parlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to
take at that early hour. The difference between his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) morning and
evening self was not so great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) companion had imagined that it
might be; the delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) spirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
manners seemed more disagreeable by the morning light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the banker, who
could hardly do more than sip his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) tea and break his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) toast without
eating it, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground
on which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home
elsewhere and will be glad to return to it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want to see an old friend,
Nick?--I must call you Nick--we always did call you young Nick when we
knew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome
family likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother's fault, calling
you Nicholas. Aren't you glad to see me again? I expected an invite
to stay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken
up now my wife's dead. I've no particular attachment to any spot; I
would as soon settle hereabout as anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong
wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was
tantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish
to stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn't suit me to
stay any longer. And I'm not going again, Nick.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Raffles</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Raffles
winked slowly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) looked at Mr. Bulstrode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don't
care about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little
travelling in the tobacco line--or something of that sort, which takes
a man into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall
back upon. That's what I want: I'm not so strong as I was, Nick,
though I've got more color than you. I want an independence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a
distance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) undertone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That must be as it suits my convenience,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles coolly. <div class="bookquote">``I see
no reason why I shouldn't make a few acquaintances hereabout. I'm not
ashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at
the turnpike when I got down--change of linen--genuine--honor bright--more
than fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps
and everything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Raffles</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Raffles had pushed away his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) chair and looked down at himself,
particularly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) straps. His (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) chief intention was to annoy
Bulstrode, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) really thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) appearance now would produce
a good effect, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was not only handsome and witty, but clad in
a mourning style which implied solid connections.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode,
after a moment's pause, <div class="bookquote">``you will expect to meet my wishes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I
always do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but
little. I've often thought since, I might have done better by telling
the old woman that I'd found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandchild: it would
have suited my feelings better; I've got a soft place in my heart. But
you've buried the old lady by this time, I suppose--it's all one to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
now. And you've got your fortune out of that profitable business which
had such a blessing on it. You've taken to being a nob, buying land,
being a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still
godly? Or taken to the Church as more genteel?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>This time Mr. Raffles' slow wink and slight protrusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) tongue
was worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was
not a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering
nausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
should not leave Raffles to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) would, and simply defy him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) as a
slanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make
people disbelieve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``But not when he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) tells any ugly-looking truth
about _you_,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no
wrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the
direct falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look
back on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax
customs, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of
falsehood.

<p/>But since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time
to the utmost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly
with me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of
gentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came
back--a nice woman in the tobacco trade--very fond of me--but the
trade was restricted, as we say. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been settled there a good
many years by a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh
and I never hit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and
I've always taken my glass in good company. It's been all on the
square with me; I'm as open as the day. You won't take it ill of me
that I didn't look you up before. I've got a complaint that makes me a
little dilatory. I thought you were trading and praying away in London
still, and didn't find you there. But you see I was sent to you,
Nick--perhaps for a blessing to both of us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) intellect more
superior to religious cant. And if the cunning which calculates on the
meanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) share,
for under the blurting rallying tone with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) spoke to Bulstrode,
there was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so
many moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) move,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, with gathered resolution--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a
man to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.
Although I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you
with a regular annuity--in quarterly payments--so long as you fulfil a
promise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your
power to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short
time, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha, ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles, with an affected explosion, <div class="bookquote">``that reminds me of
a droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your allusions are lost on me sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, with white heat;
<div class="bookquote">``the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I
should never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your
quarterly payment won't quite suit me. I like my freedom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,
swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you what! Give us
a couple of hundreds--come, that's modest--and I'll go away--honor
bright!--pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up
my Liberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like.
Perhaps it may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend;
perhaps not. Have you the money with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I have one hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate
riddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future
uncertainties. <div class="bookquote">``I will forward you the other if you will mention an
address.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I'll wait here till you bring it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said Raffles. <div class="bookquote">``I'll take a
stroll and have a snack, and you'll be back by that time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode's sickly body, shattered by the agitations he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had gone
through since the last evening, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) feel abjectly in the power of
this loud invulnerable man. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) snatched at a temporary
repose to be won on any terms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was rising to do what Raffles
suggested, when the latter said, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) finger as if with a
sudden recollection--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn't tell you;
I'd a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn't find
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but I found out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's name, and I made a note of it. But
hang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know
it again. I've got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names
wear out, by Jove! Sometimes I'm no better than a confounded tax-paper
before the names are filled in. However, if I hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
family, you shall know, Nick. You'd like to do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), now
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s your step-daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Doubtless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
light-gray eyes; <div class="bookquote">``though that might reduce my power of assisting you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) back, and
then turned towards the window to watch the banker riding away--virtually
at his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) command. His (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) lips first curled with a smile and then opened
with a short triumphant laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what the deuce was the name?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) presently said, half aloud,
scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) head, and wrinkling his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) brows horizontally. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had not
really cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It began with L; it was almost all l's I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) went on, with a
sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was
too slight, and he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men
were more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making
themselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) preferred using his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
time in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,
from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) gathered as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) wanted to know about Mr.
Bulstrode's position in Middlemarch.

<p/>After all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed
relieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was seated alone
with these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) suddenly slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
knee, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Ladislaw!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That action of memory which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
tried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly
completed itself without conscious effort--a common experience,
agreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no
value. Raffles immediately took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) pocket-book, and wrote down
the name, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) expected to use it, but merely for the sake of
not being at a loss if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) ever did happen to want it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was not going
to tell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind
like that of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) present success, and by three o'clock that
day he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had taken up his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the
coach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode's eyes of an ugly black spot on the
landscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) of the dread that the
black spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) hearth.





<p/>BOOK VI.





<p/>THE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.



<p/>CHAPTER LIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;
Per che si fa gentil ciò ch`ella mira:
Ov`ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,
E cui saluta fa tremar lo core.

<p/>Sicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,
E d'ogni suo difetto allor sospira:
Fuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:
Aiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.

<p/>Ogni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile
Nasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;
Ond'è beato chi prima la vide.
Quel ch`ella par quand' un poco sorride,
Non si può dicer, nè tener a mente,
Si è nuovo miracolo gentile.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--DANTE: la Vita Nuova.


<p/>By that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were
scenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest
worthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) abode at
Lowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather
oppressive: to sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously
at Celia's baby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain
in that momentous babe's presence with persistent disregard was a
course that could not have been tolerated in a childless sister.
Dorothea would have been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile
if there had been need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that
labor; but to an aunt who does not recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) infant nephew as
Bouddha, and has nothing to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) but to admire, his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) behavior is
apt to appear monotonous, and the interest of watching him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) exhaustible.
This possibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea's
childless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little
Arthur -LRB-baby was named after Mr. Brooke-RRB-.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ira</b></font>)
own--children or anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband. ``And if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ira</b></font>)
had had a baby, it never could have been such a dear as Arthur. Could
it, James?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if it had been like Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, conscious of some
indirectness in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion
as to the perfections of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) first-born.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia; <div class="bookquote">``and I think it
is very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) can be just as fond of our
baby as if it were her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) can have as many notions of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own
as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) likes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was not a queen,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said the devout Sir James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. <div class="bookquote">``I like
her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) better as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Hence, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
final departure to Lowick, Celia raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) eyebrows with
disappointment, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of
sarcasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing
to be done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you
quite melancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about
Tipton with Mr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is
abroad, you and Mr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure
James does everything you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the
better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you will never see him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) washed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia; <div class="bookquote">``and that is quite the
best part of the day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was almost pouting: it did seem to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) very
hard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) might stay.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea;
<div class="bookquote">``but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the
Farebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is
to be done in Middlemarch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's native strength of will was no longer all converted into
resolute submission. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was
simply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reasons.
But every one around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and
offered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months
with the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man
could hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.

<p/>The Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) daughter in
town, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and
invited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not
credible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in
the house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal
personages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea
could have nothing to object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Cadwallader said, privately, <div class="bookquote">``You will certainly go mad in that
house alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert
ourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as
other people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who
have no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care
of then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little
bored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might
become yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing
tragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that
library at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must
get a few people round you who wouldn't believe you if you told them.
That is a good lowering medicine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I never called everything by the same name that all the people about
me did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, stoutly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader, <div class="bookquote">``and that is a proof of sanity.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken
about many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the
greater part of the world has often had to come round from its opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
husband she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``It will be well for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to marry again as soon
as it is proper, if one could get her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) among the right people. Of
course the Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is
the best thing to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in order. If we were not so poor I would
invite Lord Triton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will be marquis some day, and there is no
denying that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would make a good marchioness: she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) looks handsomer
than ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mourning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of
no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the easy Rector.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women
together? And it is a shame that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) uncle should have run away and
shut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible
matches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely
the man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed
sort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) choose if she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has
no variety to choose from? A woman's choice usually means taking the
only man she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) friends don't
exert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon
business yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake don't touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore
point with Sir James. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would be deeply offended if you entered on it
to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) unnecessarily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never entered on it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) hands.
<div class="bookquote">``Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking
of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the
young fellow is going out of the neighborhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) husband three significant
nods, with a very sarcastic expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) dark eyes.

<p/>Dorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So
by the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and
the morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of
note-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,
the mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with
roses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose
oftenest to sit. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked into every room, questioning the
eighteen months of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) married life, and carrying on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thoughts as if
they were a speech to be heard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband. Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lingered in
the library and could not be at rest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had carefully ranged all
the note-books as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would wish to see them, in
orderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling
motive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) still clung about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) image, even while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in indignant thought and told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
unjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as
superstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, <div class="bookquote">``I
could not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul
to yours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in--Dorothea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) deposited the paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) own desk.

<p/>That silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because
underneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which
had really determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to come to Lowick. The longing was to see
Will Ladislaw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did not know any good that could come of their
meeting: she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was helpless; her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hands had been tied from making up to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) for any unfairness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) lot. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) soul thirsted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).
How could it be otherwise? If a princess in the days of enchantment
had seen a four-footed creature from among those which live in herds
come to her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) once and again with a human gaze which rested upon her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) with
choice and beseeching, what would she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) think of in her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) journeying, what
would she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) look for when the herds passed her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>)? Surely for the gaze
which had found her (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>), and which she (<font color='blue'><b>princess</b></font>) would know again. Life would be no
better than candle-light tinsel and daylight rubbish if our spirits
were not touched by what has been, to issues of longing and constancy.
It was true that Dorothea wanted to know the Farebrothers better, and
especially to talk to the new rector, but also true that remembering
what Lydgate had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) about Will Ladislaw and little Miss Noble,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) counted on Will's coming to Lowick to see the Farebrother family.
The very first Sunday, _before_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) entered the church, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) the last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was there, alone in the clergyman's
pew; but _when_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) figure was gone.

<p/>In the week-days when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went to see the ladies at the Rectory, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
listened in vain for some word that they might let fall about Will; but
it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that Mrs. Farebrother talked of every one else in the
neighborhood and out of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably some of Mr. Farebrother's Middlemarch hearers may follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
to Lowick sometimes. Do you not think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rather
despising herself for having a secret motive in asking the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they are wise they will, Mrs. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady. <div class="bookquote">``I see
that you set a right value on my son's preaching. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) grandfather on
my side was an excellent clergyman, but his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father was in the law:--most
exemplary and honest nevertheless, which is a reason for our never
being rich. They say Fortune is a woman and capricious. But sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a good woman and gives to those who merit, which has been the
case with you, Mrs. Casaubon, who have given a living to my son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Farebrother recurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) knitting with a dignified satisfaction
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) neat little effort at oratory, but this was not what Dorothea
wanted to hear. Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not even know whether Will
Ladislaw was still at Middlemarch, and there was no one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dared
to ask, unless it were Lydgate. But just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not see Lydgate
without sending for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) or going to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Perhaps Will Ladislaw,
having heard of that strange ban against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) left by Mr. Casaubon, had
felt it better that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should not meet again, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was wrong to wish for a meeting that others might find many good
reasons against. Still <div class="bookquote">``I do wish it''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came at the end of those wise
reflections as naturally as a sob after holding the breath. And the
meeting did happen, but in a formal way quite unexpected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>One morning, about eleven, Dorothea was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) boudoir with a
map of the land attached to the manor and other papers before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
which were to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in making an exact statement for herself of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
income and affairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not yet applied herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) work, but
was seated with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands folded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lap, looking out along the
avenue of limes to the distant fields. Every leaf was at rest in the
sunshine, the familiar scene was changeless, and seemed to represent
the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life, full of motiveless ease--motiveless, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own energy could not seek out reasons for ardent action. The widow's
cap of those times made an oval frame for the face, and had a crown
standing up; the dress was an experiment in the utmost laying on of
crape; but this heavy solemnity of clothing made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face look all the
younger, with its recovered bloom, and the sweet, inquiring candor of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reverie was broken by Tantripp, who came to say that Mr. Ladislaw
was below, and begged permission to see Madam if it were not too early.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rising immediately. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) be shown
into the drawing-room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The drawing-room was the most neutral room in the house to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--the
one least associated with the trials of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) married life: the damask
matched the wood-work, which was all white and gold; there were two
tall mirrors and tables with nothing on them--in brief, it was a room
where you had no reason for sitting in one place rather than in
another. It was below the boudoir, and had also a bow-window looking
out on the avenue. But when Pratt showed Will Ladislaw into it the
window was open; and a winged visitor, buzzing in and out now and then
without minding the furniture, made the room look less formal and
uninhabited.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see you here again, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pratt</b></font>)</div>said Pratt, lingering to adjust a
blind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am only come to say good-by, Pratt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, who wished even the
butler to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was too proud to hang about Mrs. Casaubon now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was a rich widow.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very sorry to hear it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pratt</b></font>)</div>said Pratt, retiring. Of course, as a
servant who was to be told nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) knew the fact of which Ladislaw
was still ignorant, and had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) inferences; indeed, had not
differed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) betrothed Tantripp when she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Your master was as
jealous as a fiend--and no reason. Madam would look higher than Mr.
Ladislaw, else I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). Mrs. Cadwallader's maid says there's
a lord coming who is to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) when the mourning's over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There were not many moments for Will to walk about with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
hand before Dorothea entered. The meeting was very different from that
first meeting in Rome when Will had been embarrassed and Dorothea calm.
This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt miserable but determined, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was in a state of
agitation which could not be hidden. Just outside the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
felt that this longed-for meeting was after all too difficult, and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw Will advancing towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), the deep blush which was rare in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came with painful suddenness. Neither of them knew how it was, but
neither of them spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand for a moment, and then they
went to sit down near the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) on one settee and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) on another
opposite. Will was peculiarly uneasy: it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) not like
Dorothea that the mere fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) being a widow should cause such a
change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) manner of receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knew of no other
condition which could have affected their previous relation to each
other--except that, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) imagination at once told him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends
might have been poisoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind with their suspicions of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I have not presumed too much in calling,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will; <div class="bookquote">``I could
not bear to leave the neighborhood and begin a new life without seeing
you to say good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Presumed? Surely not. I should have thought it unkind if you had not
wished to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) habit of speaking with perfect
genuineness asserting itself through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncertainty and agitation.
<div class="bookquote">``Are you going away immediately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very soon, I think. I intend to go to town and eat my dinners as a
barrister, since, they say, that is the preparation for all public
business. There will be a great deal of political work to be done
by-and-by, and I mean to try and do some of it. Other men have managed
to win an honorable position for themselves without family or money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that will make it all the more honorable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
ardently. <div class="bookquote">``Besides, you have so many talents. I have heard from my
uncle how well you speak in public, so that every one is sorry when you
leave off, and how clearly you can explain things. And you care that
justice should be done to every one. I am so glad. When we were in
Rome, I thought you only cared for poetry and art, and the things that
adorn life for us who are well off. But now I know you think about the
rest of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was speaking Dorothea had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) personal embarrassment,
and had become like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) former self. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked at Will with a direct
glance, full of delighted confidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You approve of my going away for years, then, and never coming here
again till I have made myself of some mark in the world?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will,
trying hard to reconcile the utmost pride with the utmost effort to get
an expression of strong feeling from Dorothea.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not aware how long it was before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) answered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had turned
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head and was looking out of the window on the rose-bushes, which
seemed to have in them the summers of all the years when Will would be
away. This was not judicious behavior. But Dorothea never thought of
studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) manners: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought only of bowing to a sad necessity
which divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from Will. Those first words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
intentions had seemed to make everything clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
supposed, all about Mr. Casaubon's final conduct in relation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>),
and it had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) with the same sort of shock as to herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
had never felt more than friendship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--had never had anything in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind to justify what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's outrage on the
feelings of both: and that friendship he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) still felt. Something which
may be called an inward silent sob had gone on in Dorothea before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
said with a pure voice, just trembling in the last words as if only
from its liquid flexibility--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it must be right for you to do as you say. I shall be very happy
when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have
patience. It will perhaps be a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Will never quite knew how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) saved himself from falling
down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feet, when the <div class="bookquote">``long while''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>came forth with its gentle
tremor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) used to say that the horrible hue and surface of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) crape
dress was most likely the sufficient controlling force. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sat still,
however, and only said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never hear from you. And you will forget all about me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``I shall never forget you. I have never forgotten
any one whom I once knew. My life has never been crowded, and seems
not likely to be so. And I have a great deal of space for memory at
Lowick, haven't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) smiled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Will burst out passionately, rising, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hat still in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hand, and walking away to a marble table, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) suddenly turned
and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) back against it. The blood had mounted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) face and
neck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looked almost angry. It had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as if they were
like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other's presence,
while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning. But
there was no help for it. It should never be true of him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that in this
meeting to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had come with bitter resolution he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had ended by a
confession which might be interpreted into asking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) fortune.
Moreover, it was actually true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was fearful of the effect which
such confessions might have on Dorothea herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) from that distance in some trouble, imagining that
there might have been an offence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) words. But all the while there
was a current of thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) probable want of money, and
the impossibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). If her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had been at home,
something might have been done through him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! It was this preoccupation
with the hardship of Will's wanting money, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had what ought to
have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) share, which led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to say, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) remained
silent and looked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder whether you would like to have that miniature which hangs
up-stairs--I mean that beautiful miniature of your grandmother. I
think it is not right for me to keep it, if you would wish to have it.
It is wonderfully like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, irritably. <div class="bookquote">``No; I don't mind about it.
It is not very consoling to have one's own likeness. It would be more
consoling if others wanted to have it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought you would like to cherish her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) memory--I thought--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea
broke off an instant, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) imagination suddenly warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) away from
Aunt Julia's history--<div class="bookquote">``you would surely like to have the miniature as a
family memorial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Aunt Julia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I have that, when I have nothing else! A man with only a
portmanteau for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stowage must keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memorials in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will spoke at random: he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was merely venting his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) petulance; it was a
little too exasperating to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) grandmother's portrait offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
at that moment. But to Dorothea's feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) words had a peculiar
sting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose and said with a touch of indignation as well as
hauteur--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are much the happier of us two, Mr. Ladislaw, to have nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was startled. Whatever the words might be, the tone seemed like a
dismissal; and quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) leaning posture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) walked a little way
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Their eyes met, but with a strange questioning gravity.
Something was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to
conjecture what was in the other. Will had really never thought of
himself as having a claim of inheritance on the property which was held
by Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) understand
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) present feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never felt it a misfortune to have nothing till now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But
poverty may be as bad as leprosy, if it divides us from what we most
care for.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The words cut Dorothea to the heart, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) relent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) answered
in a tone of sad fellowship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorrow comes in so many ways. Two years ago I had no notion of
that--I mean of the unexpected way in which trouble comes, and ties our
hands, and makes us silent when we long to speak. I used to despise
women a little for not shaping their lives more, and doing better
things. I was very fond of doing as I liked, but I have almost given
it up,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ended, smiling playfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not given up doing as I like, but I can very seldom do it,''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was standing two yards from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind full of
contradictory desires and resolves--desiring some unmistakable proof
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and yet dreading the position into which such a
proof might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The thing one most longs for may be surrounded
with conditions that would be intolerable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pratt</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment Pratt entered and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sir James Chettam is in the
library, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Pratt</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Sir James to come in here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, immediately. It was as
if the same electric shock had passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and Will. Each of
them felt proudly resistant, and neither looked at the other, while
they awaited Sir James's entrance.

<p/>After shaking hands with Dorothea, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) bowed as slightly as possible to
Ladislaw, who repaid the slightness exactly, and then going towards
Dorothea, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must say good-by, Mrs. Casaubon; and probably for a long while.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand and said her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) good-by cordially. The sense
that Sir James was depreciating Will, and behaving rudely to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),
roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resolution and dignity: there was no touch of confusion in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) manner. And when Will had left the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked with such calm
self-possession at Sir James, saying, <div class="bookquote">``How is Celia?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was
obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). And what would be the
use of behaving otherwise? Indeed, Sir James shrank with so much
dislike from the association even in thought of Dorothea with Ladislaw
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) possible lover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would himself have wished to avoid an
outward show of displeasure which would have recognized the
disagreeable possibility. If any one had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) shrank in
that way, I am not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would at first have said anything
fuller or more precise than <div class="bookquote">''_That_ Ladislaw!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--though on reflection
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) might have urged that Mr. Casaubon's codicil, barring Dorothea's
marriage with Will, except under a penalty, was enough to cast
unfitness over any relation at all between them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) aversion was all
the stronger because he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt himself unable to interfere.

<p/>But Sir James was a power in a way unguessed by himself. Entering at
that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was an incorporation of the strongest reasons through
which Will's pride became a repellent force, keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) asunder from
Dorothea.



<p/>CHAPTER LV.

<p/>Hath she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) faults? I would you had them too.
They are the fruity must of soundest wine;
Or say, they are regenerating fire
Such as hath turned the dense black element
Into a crystal pathway for the sun.


<p/>If youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that
our elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth to think
its emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each
crisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are told that the
oldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be agitated by the
earthquakes, but they probably see beyond each shock, and reflect that
there are plenty more to come.

<p/>To Dorothea, still in that time of youth when the eyes with their long
full lashes look out after their rain of tears unsoiled and unwearied
as a freshly opened passion-flower, that morning's parting with Will
Ladislaw seemed to be the close of their personal relations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was
going away into the distance of unknown years, and if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) came back
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would be another man. The actual state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mind--his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) proud
resolve to give the lie beforehand to any suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would play
the needy adventurer seeking a rich woman--lay quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
imagination, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had interpreted all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) behavior easily enough by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposition that Mr. Casaubon's codicil seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), as it did to
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), a gross and cruel interdict on any active friendship between them.
Their young delight in speaking to each other, and saying what no one
else would care to hear, was forever ended, and become a treasure of
the past. For this very reason she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dwelt on it without inward check.
That unique happiness too was dead, and in its shadowed silent chamber
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might vent the passionate grief which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself wondered at. For
the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took down the miniature from the wall and kept it
before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), liking to blend the woman who had been too hardly judged
with the grandson whom her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own heart and judgment defended. Can any
one who has rejoiced in woman's tenderness think it a reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took the little oval picture in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) palm and made a bed for it
there, and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek upon it, as if that would soothe the
creatures who had suffered unjust condemnation? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know then
that it was Love who had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) briefly, as in a dream before
awaking, with the hues of morning on his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) wings--that it was Love to
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was sobbing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) farewell as his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) image was banished by the
blameless rigor of irresistible day. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only felt that there was
something irrevocably amiss and lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lot, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts about
the future were the more readily shapen into resolve. Ardent souls,
ready to construct their coming lives, are apt to commit themselves to
the fulfilment of their own visions.

<p/>One day that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to Freshitt to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promise of staying all
night and seeing baby washed, Mrs. Cadwallader came to dine, the Rector
being gone on a fishing excursion. It was a warm evening, and even in
the delightful drawing-room, where the fine old turf sloped from the
open window towards a lilied pool and well-planted mounds, the heat was
enough to make Celia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) white muslin and light curls reflect with
pity on what Dodo must feel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) black dress and close cap. But this
was not until some episodes with baby were over, and had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) mind
at leisure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) had seated herself and taken up a fan for some time
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) said, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) quiet guttural--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Dodo, do throw off that cap. I am sure your dress must make you
feel ill.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am so used to the cap--it has become a sort of shell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I feel rather bare and exposed when it is off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must see you without it; it makes us all warm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, throwing
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) fan, and going to Dorothea. It was a pretty picture to see
this little lady in white muslin unfastening the widow's cap from her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)
more majestic sister, and tossing it on to a chair. Just as the coils
and braids of dark-brown hair had been set free, Sir James entered the
room. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) looked at the released head, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>in a tone of
satisfaction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was I who did it, James,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``Dodo need not make such a
slavery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) mourning; she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) need not wear that cap any more among her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
friends.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam, <div class="bookquote">``a widow must wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) mourning at
least a year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) marries again before the end of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader,
who had some pleasure in startling her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) good friend the Dowager. Sir
James was annoyed, and leaned forward to play with Celia's Maltese dog.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very rare, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam, in a tone intended to
guard against such events. <div class="bookquote">``No friend of ours ever committed herself
in that way except Mrs. Beevor, and it was very painful to Lord
Grinsell when she (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) did so. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) first husband was objectionable, which
made it the greater wonder. And severely she (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) was punished for it.
They said Captain Beevor dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) about by the hair, and held up
loaded pistols at her (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) took the wrong man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, who was in a
decidedly wicked mood. <div class="bookquote">``Marriage is always bad then, first or second.
Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has got no other.
I would rather have a good second husband than an indifferent first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, your clever tongue runs away with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam.
<div class="bookquote">``I am sure you would be the last woman to marry again prematurely, if
our dear Rector were taken away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I make no vows; it might be a necessary economy. It is lawful to
marry again, I suppose; else we might as well be Hindoos instead of
Christians. Of course if a woman accepts the wrong man, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must take
the consequences, and one who does it twice over deserves her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fate.
But if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can marry blood, beauty, and bravery--the sooner the
better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think the subject of our conversation is very ill-chosen,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James, with a look of disgust. <div class="bookquote">``Suppose we change it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not on my account, Sir James,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, determined not to lose
the opportunity of freeing herself from certain oblique references to
excellent matches. <div class="bookquote">``If you are speaking on my behalf, I can assure you
that no question can be more indifferent and impersonal to me than
second marriage. It is no more to me than if you talked of women going
fox-hunting: whether it is admirable in them or not, I shall not follow
them. Pray let Mrs. Cadwallader amuse herself on that subject as much
as on any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Mrs. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) stateliest way, <div class="bookquote">``you
do not, I hope, think there was any allusion to you in my mentioning
Mrs. Beevor. It was only an instance that occurred to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Beevor</b></font>) was
step-daughter to Lord Grinsell: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grinsell</b></font>) married Mrs. Teveroy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Grinsell</b></font>) second
wife. There could be no possible allusion to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody chose the subject; it all came out of
Dodo's cap. Mrs. Cadwallader only said what was quite true. A woman
could not be married in a widow's cap, James.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``I will not offend again. I
will not even refer to Dido or Zenobia. Only what are we to talk
about? I, for my part, object to the discussion of Human Nature,
because that is the nature of rectors' wives.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/>Later in the evening, after Mrs. Cadwallader was gone, Celia said
privately to Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``Really, Dodo, taking your cap off made you like
yourself again in more ways than one. You spoke up just as you used to
do, when anything was said to displease you. But I could hardly make
out whether it was James that you thought wrong, or Mrs. Cadwallader.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``James spoke out of delicacy to me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
was mistaken in supposing that I minded what Mrs. Cadwallader said. I
should only mind if there were a law obliging me to take any piece of
blood and beauty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) or anybody else recommended.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you know, Dodo, if you ever did marry, it would be all the better
to have blood and beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, reflecting that Mr. Casaubon had
not been richly endowed with those gifts, and that it would be well to
caution Dorothea in time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be anxious, Kitty; I have quite other thoughts about my life. I
shall never marry again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister's chin,
and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with indulgent affection. Celia was nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
baby, and Dorothea had come to say good-night to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really--quite?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia. <div class="bookquote">``Not anybody at all--if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were very
wonderful indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Not anybody at all. I have
delightful plans. I should like to take a great deal of land, and
drain it, and make a little colony, where everybody should work, and
all the work should be done well. I should know every one of the
people and be their friend. I am going to have great consultations
with Mr. Garth: he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) can tell me almost everything I want to know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you _will_ be happy, if you have a plan, Dodo?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps little Arthur will like plans when he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) grows up, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)
can help you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James was informed that same night that Dorothea was really quite
set against marrying anybody at all, and was going to take to <div class="bookquote">``all
sorts of plans,''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>just like what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) used to have. Sir James made no
remark. To his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) secret feeling there was something repulsive in a
woman's second marriage, and no match would prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) from feeling it
a sort of desecration for Dorothea. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was aware that the world would
regard such a sentiment as preposterous, especially in relation to a
woman of one-and-twenty; the practice of <div class="bookquote">``the world''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>being to treat of
a young widow's second marriage as certain and probably near, and to
smile with meaning if the widow acts accordingly. But if Dorothea did
choose to espouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) felt that the resolution would well
become her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER LVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How happy is he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) born and taught
That serveth not another's will;
Whose armor is his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) honest thought,
And simple truth his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) only skill!
... . .
This man is freed from servile bands
Of hope to rise or fear to fall;
Lord of himself though not of lands;
And having nothing yet hath all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SIR HENRY WOTTON.


<p/>Dorothea's confidence in Caleb Garth's knowledge, which had begun on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) approved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cottages, had grown fast during her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
stay at Freshitt, Sir James having induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to take rides over the
two estates in company with himself and Caleb, who quite returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
admiration, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife that Mrs. Casaubon had a head for
business most uncommon in a woman. It must be remembered that by
<div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Caleb never meant money transactions, but the skilful
application of labor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most uncommon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>repeated Caleb. ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said a thing I often used to
think myself when I was a lad:--``Mr. Garth, I should like to feel, if I
lived to be old, that I had improved a great piece of land and built a
great many good cottages, because the work is of a healthy kind while
it is being done, and after it is done, men are the better for it.<div class="bookquote">''
Those were the very words: she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sees into things in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But womanly, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, half suspecting that Mrs.
Casaubon might not hold the true principle of subordination.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, you can't think!''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head. ``You would like
to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) speak, Susan. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) speaks in such plain words, and a voice
like music. Bless me! it reminds me of bits in the <div class="bookquote">``Messiah'--`and
straightway there appeared a multitude of the heavenly host, praising
God and saying;' it has a tone with it that satisfies your ear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb was very fond of music, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could afford it went to hear
an oratorio that came within his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) reach, returning from it with a
profound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
sit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable
language into his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) outstretched hands.

<p/>With this good understanding between them, it was natural that Dorothea
asked Mr. Garth to undertake any business connected with the three
farms and the numerous tenements attached to Lowick Manor; indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
expectation of getting work for two was being fast fulfilled. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``Business breeds.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And one form of business which was beginning
to breed just then was the construction of railways. A projected line
was to run through Lowick parish where the cattle had hitherto grazed
in a peace unbroken by astonishment; and thus it happened that the
infant struggles of the railway system entered into the affairs of
Caleb Garth, and determined the course of this history with regard to
two persons who were dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>). The submarine railway may have its
difficulties; but the bed of the sea is not divided among various
landed proprietors with claims for damages not only measurable but
sentimental. In the hundred to which Middlemarch belonged railways
were as exciting a topic as the Reform Bill or the imminent horrors of
Cholera, and those who held the most decided views on the subject were
women and landholders. Women both old and young regarded travelling by
steam as presumptuous and dangerous, and argued against it by saying
that nothing should induce them to get into a railway carriage; while
proprietors, differing from each other in their arguments as much as
Mr. Solomon Featherstone differed from Lord Medlicote, were yet
unanimous in the opinion that in selling land, whether to the Enemy of
mankind or to a company obliged to purchase, these pernicious agencies
must be made to pay a very high price to landowners for permission to
injure mankind.

<p/>But the slower wits, such as Mr. Solomon and Mrs. Waule, who both
occupied land of their own, took a long time to arrive at this
conclusion, their minds halting at the vivid conception of what it
would be to cut the Big Pasture in two, and turn it into three-cornered
bits, which would be <div class="bookquote">``nohow;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>while accommodation-bridges and high
payments were remote and incredible.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The cows will all cast their calves, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Waule, in a
tone of deep melancholy, <div class="bookquote">``if the railway comes across the Near Close;
and I shouldn't wonder at the mare too, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) was in foal. It's a
poor tale if a widow's property is to be spaded away, and the law say
nothing to it. What's to hinder 'em from cutting right and left if
they begin? It's well known, _I_ can't fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The best way would be to say nothing, and set somebody on to send 'em
away with a flea in their ear, when they came spying and measuring,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``Folks did that about Brassing, by what I can
understand. It's all a pretence, if the truth was known, about their
being forced to take one way. Let 'em go cutting in another parish.
And I don't believe in any pay to make amends for bringing a lot of
ruffians to trample your crops. Where's a company's pocket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brother Peter, God forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>), got money out of a company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Waule/Waule</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Waule. <div class="bookquote">``But that was for the manganese. That wasn't for railways to
blow you to pieces right and left.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, there's this to be said, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Solomon/Mr. Solomon Featherstone</b></font>)</div>Mr. Solomon concluded, lowering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) voice in a cautious manner--<div class="bookquote">``the more spokes we put in their wheel,
the more they'll pay us to let 'em go on, if they must come whether or
not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Solomon/Mr. Solomon Featherstone</b></font>)</div><p/>This reasoning of Mr. Solomon's was perhaps less thorough than he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>)
imagined, his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) cunning bearing about the same relation to the course of
railways as the cunning of a diplomatist bears to the general chill or
catarrh of the solar system. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) set about acting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) views in a
thoroughly diplomatic manner, by stimulating suspicion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) side of
Lowick was the most remote from the village, and the houses of the
laboring people were either lone cottages or were collected in a hamlet
called Frick, where a water-mill and some stone-pits made a little
centre of slow, heavy-shouldered industry.

<p/>In the absence of any precise idea as to what railways were, public
opinion in Frick was against them; for the human mind in that grassy
corner had not the proverbial tendency to admire the unknown, holding
rather that it was likely to be against the poor man, and that
suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it. Even the rumor
of Reform had not yet excited any millennial expectations in Frick,
there being no definite promise in it, as of gratuitous grains to
fatten Hiram Ford's pig, or of a publican at the <div class="bookquote">``Weights and Scales''
 (<font color='red'><b>a publican</b></font>)</div>who would brew beer for nothing, or of an offer on the part of the
three neighboring farmers to raise wages during winter. And without
distinct good of this kind in its promises, Reform seemed on a footing
with the bragging of pedlers, which was a hint for distrust to every
knowing person. The men of Frick were not ill-fed, and were less given
to fanaticism than to a strong muscular suspicion; less inclined to
believe that they were peculiarly cared for by heaven, than to regard
heaven itself as rather disposed to take them in--a disposition
observable in the weather.

<p/>Thus the mind of Frick was exactly of the sort for Mr. Solomon
Featherstone to work upon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) having more plenteous ideas of the same
order, with a suspicion of heaven and earth which was better fed and
more entirely at leisure. Solomon was overseer of the roads at that
time, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) slow-paced cob often took his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) rounds by Frick to look
at the workmen getting the stones there, pausing with a mysterious
deliberation, which might have misled you into supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) had
some other reason for staying than the mere want of impulse to move.
After looking for a long while at any work that was going on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) would
raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) eyes a little and look at the horizon; finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) would shake
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) bridle, touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) horse with the whip, and get it to move slowly
onward. The hour-hand of a clock was quick by comparison with Mr.
Solomon, who had an agreeable sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) could afford to be slow.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) was in the habit of pausing for a cautious, vaguely designing chat
with every hedger or ditcher on his (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) way, and was especially willing to
listen even to news which he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) had heard before, feeling himself at an
advantage over all narrators in partially disbelieving them. One day,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>) got into a dialogue with Hiram Ford, a wagoner, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>)
himself contributed information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) wished to know whether Hiram had
seen fellows with staves and instruments spying about: they called
themselves railroad people, but there was no telling what they were or
what they meant to do. The least they pretended was that they were
going to cut Lowick Parish into sixes and sevens.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there'll be no stirrin' from one pla-ace to another,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hiram/Hiram Ford</b></font>)</div>said Hiram,
thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) wagon and horses.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Solomon/Mr. Solomon Featherstone</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``And cutting up fine land such as this
parish! Let 'em go into Tipton, say I. But there's no knowing what
there is at the bottom of it. Traffic is what they put for`ard; but
it's to do harm to the land and the poor man in the long-run.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, they're Lunnon chaps, I reckon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hiram/Hiram Ford</b></font>)</div>said Hiram, who had a dim notion
of London as a centre of hostility to the country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, to be sure. And in some parts against Brassing, by what I've
heard say, the folks fell on 'em when they were spying, and broke their
peep-holes as they carry, and drove 'em away, so as they knew better
than come again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It war good foon, I'd be bound,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hiram/Hiram Ford</b></font>)</div>said Hiram, whose fun was much
restricted by circumstances.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I wouldn't meddle with 'em myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon/Brother Solomon/Brother</b></font>)</div>said Solomon. <div class="bookquote">``But some say
this country's seen its best days, and the sign is, as it's being
overrun with these fellows trampling right and left, and wanting to cut
it up into railways; and all for the big traffic to swallow up the
little, so as there shan't be a team left on the land, nor a whip to
crack.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll crack _my_ whip about their ear`n, afore they bring it to that,
though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hiram/Hiram Ford</b></font>)</div>said Hiram, while Mr. Solomon, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Hiram</b></font>) bridle, moved
onward.

<p/>Nettle-seed needs no digging. The ruin of this countryside by
railroads was discussed, not only at the <div class="bookquote">``Weights and Scales,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but in
the hay-field, where the muster of working hands gave opportunities for
talk such as were rarely had through the rural year.

<p/>One morning, not long after that interview between Mr. Farebrother and
Mary Garth, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) confessed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) feeling for Fred Vincy,
it happened that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) father had some business which took him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
Yoddrell's farm in the direction of Frick: it was to measure and value
an outlying piece of land belonging to Lowick Manor, which Caleb
expected to dispose of advantageously for Dorothea -LRB-it must be
confessed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) bias was towards getting the best possible terms
from railroad companies-RRB-. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) gig at Yoddrell's, and in
walking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) assistant and measuring-chain to the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) encountered the party of the company's agents, who were
adjusting their spirit-level. After a little chat he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) left them,
observing that by-and-by they would reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) again where he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was going
to measure. It was one of those gray mornings after light rains, which
become delicious about twelve o'clock, when the clouds part a little,
and the scent of the earth is sweet along the lanes and by the
hedgerows.

<p/>The scent would have been sweeter to Fred Vincy, who was coming along
the lanes on horseback, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) mind had not been worried by
unsuccessful efforts to imagine what he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was to do, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) father on
one side expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) straightway to enter the Church, with Mary on
the other threatening to forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) did enter it, and with the
working-day world showing no eager need whatever of a young gentleman
without capital and generally unskilled. It was the harder to Fred's
disposition because his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, satisfied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was no longer
rebellious, was in good humor with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) on this
pleasant ride to see after some greyhounds. Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had fixed on
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should do, there would be the task of telling his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father. But
it must be admitted that the fixing, which had to come first, was the
more difficult task:--what secular avocation on earth was there for a
young man -LRB-whose friends could not get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an <div class="bookquote">``appointment'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-RRB- which was
at once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special
knowledge? Riding along the lanes by Frick in this mood, and
slackening his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) pace while he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) reflected whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) should venture to go
round by Lowick Parsonage to call on Mary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) could see over the hedges
from one field to another. Suddenly a noise roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) attention, and
on the far side of a field on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) left hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Frick</b></font>) could see six or seven
men in smock-frocks with hay-forks in their hands making an offensive
approach towards the four railway agents who were facing them, while
Caleb Garth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) assistant were hastening across the field to join
the threatened group. Fred, delayed a few moments by having to find
the gate, could not gallop up to the spot before the party in
smock-frocks, whose work of turning the hay had not been too pressing
after swallowing their mid-day beer, were driving the men in coats
before them with their hay-forks; while Caleb Garth's assistant, a lad
of seventeen, who had snatched up the spirit-level at Caleb's order,
had been knocked down and seemed to be lying helpless. The coated men
had the advantage as runners, and Fred covered their retreat by getting
in front of the smock-frocks and charging them suddenly enough to throw
their chase into confusion. <div class="bookquote">``What do you confounded fools mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>shouted Fred, pursuing the divided group in a zigzag, and cutting right
and left with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) whip. <div class="bookquote">``I'll swear to every one of you before the
magistrate. You've knocked the lad down and killed him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), for what I
know. You'll every one of you be hanged at the next assizes, if you
don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who afterwards laughed heartily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own phrases.

<p/>The laborers had been driven through the gate-way into their hay-field,
and Fred had checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) horse, when Hiram Ford, observing himself at a
safe challenging distance, turned back and shouted a defiance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>)
did not know to be Homeric.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yo're a coward, yo are. Yo git off your horse, young measter, and
I'll have a round wi' ye, I wull. Yo daredn't come on wi'out your hoss
an' whip. I'd soon knock the breath out on ye, I would.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute, and I'll come back presently, and have a round with you
all in turn, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, who felt confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) power
of boxing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) dearly beloved brethren. But just now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wanted to
hasten back to Caleb and the prostrate youth.

<p/>The lad's ankle was strained, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was in much pain from it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
was no further hurt, and Fred placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) on the horse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might
ride to Yoddrell's and be taken care of there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let them put the horse in the stable, and tell the surveyors they can
come back for their traps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``The ground is clear now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, <div class="bookquote">``here's a breakage. They'll have to give up for
to-day, and it will be as well. Here, take the things before you on
the horse, Tom. They'll see you coming, and they'll turn back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm glad I happened to be here at the right moment, Mr. Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said
Fred, as Tom rode away. <div class="bookquote">``No knowing what might have happened if the
cavalry had not come up in time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, it was lucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, speaking rather absently, and
looking towards the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had been at work at the moment of
interruption. <div class="bookquote">``But--deuce take it--this is what comes of men being
fools--I'm hindered of my day's work. I can't get along without
somebody to help me with the measuring-chain. However!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was
beginning to move towards the spot with a look of vexation, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
had forgotten Fred's presence, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turned round and said
quickly, <div class="bookquote">``What have you got to do to-day, young fellow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, Mr. Garth. I'll help you with pleasure--can I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
with a sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should be courting Mary when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you mustn't mind stooping and getting hot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind anything. Only I want to go first and have a round with
that hulky fellow who turned to challenge me. It would be a good
lesson for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). I shall not be five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) most peremptory intonation. <div class="bookquote">``I shall
go and speak to the men myself. It's all ignorance. Somebody has been
telling them lies. The poor fools don't know any better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall go with you, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; stay where you are. I don't want your young blood. I can
take care of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of
hurting others and the fear of having to speechify. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) felt it his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
duty at this moment to try and give a little harangue. There was a
striking mixture in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)--which came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) having always been a
hard-working man himself--of rigorous notions about workmen and
practical indulgence towards them. To do a good day's work and to do
it well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) held to be part of their welfare, as it was the chief part
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own happiness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a strong sense of fellowship with
them. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) advanced towards the laborers they had not gone to work
again, but were standing in that form of rural grouping which consists
in each turning a shoulder towards the other, at a distance of two or
three yards. They looked rather sulkily at Caleb, who walked quickly
with one hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) pocket and the other thrust between the buttons of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) waistcoat, and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) every-day mild air when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) paused among them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, my lads, how's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) began, taking as usual to brief phrases,
which seemed pregnant to himself, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had many thoughts lying
under them, like the abundant roots of a plant that just manages to
peep above the water. <div class="bookquote">``How came you to make such a mistake as this?
Somebody has been telling you lies. You thought those men up there
wanted to do mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aw!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer, dropped at intervals by each according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
degree of unreadiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! No such thing! They're looking out to see which way the
railroad is to take. Now, my lads, you can't hinder the railroad: it
will be made whether you like it or not. And if you go fighting
against it, you'll get yourselves into trouble. The law gives those
men leave to come here on the land. The owner has nothing to say
against it, and if you meddle with them you'll have to do with the
constable and Justice Blakesley, and with the handcuffs and Middlemarch
jail. And you might be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb paused here, and perhaps the greatest orator could not have
chosen either his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) pause or his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) images better for the occasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But come, you didn't mean any harm. Somebody told you the railroad
was a bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and
there, to this and to that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the
railway's a good thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aw! good for the big folks to make money out on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy</b></font>)</div>said old Timothy
Cooper, who had stayed behind turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Cooper</b></font>) hay while the others had been
gone on their spree;--<div class="bookquote">``I'n seen lots o' things turn up sin' I war a
young un--the war an' the peace, and the canells, an' the oald King
George, an' the Regen', an' the new King George, an' the new un as has
got a new ne-ame--an' it's been all aloike to the poor mon.. What's the
canells been t' him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)? They'n brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor
wage to lay by, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) didn't save it wi' clemmin' his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own inside.
Times ha' got wusser for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sin' I war a young un. An' so it'll be
wi' the railroads. They'll on'y leave the poor mon furder behind. But
them are fools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here. This is the
big folks's world, this is. But yo're for the big folks, Muster Garth,
yo are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>Timothy was a wiry old laborer, of a type lingering in those times--who
had his (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) savings in a stocking-foot, lived in a lone cottage, and was
not to be wrought on by any oratory, having as little of the feudal
spirit, and believing as little, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Timothy</b></font>) had not been totally
unacquainted with the Age of Reason and the Rights of Man. Caleb was
in a difficulty known to any person attempting in dark times and
unassisted by miracle to reason with rustics who are in possession of
an undeniable truth which they know through a hard process of feeling,
and can let it fall like a giant's club on your neatly carved argument
for a social benefit which they do not feel. Caleb had no cant at
command, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could have chosen to use it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had been
accustomed to meet all such difficulties in no other way than by doing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``business''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>faithfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) answered--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't think well of me, Tim, never mind; that's neither here
nor there now. Things may be bad for the poor man--bad they are; but I
want the lads here not to do what will make things worse for
themselves. The cattle may have a heavy load, but it won't help 'em to
throw it over into the roadside pit, when it's partly their own fodder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We war on'y for a bit o' foon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hiram/Hiram Ford</b></font>)</div>said Hiram, who was beginning to see
consequences. <div class="bookquote">``That war all we war arter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, promise me not to meddle again, and I'll see that nobody informs
against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'n ne'er meddled, an' I'n no call to promise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timothy</b></font>)</div>said Timothy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, but the rest. Come, I'm as hard at work as any of you to-day, and
I can't spare much time. Say you'll be quiet without the constable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aw, we wooant meddle--they may do as they loike for oos'' (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>--were the
forms in which Caleb got his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) pledges; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hastened back to
Fred, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) in the gateway.

<p/>They went to work, and Fred helped vigorously. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spirits had risen,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) heartily enjoyed a good slip in the moist earth under the
hedgerow, which soiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) perfect summer trousers. Was it his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
successful onset which had elated him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), or the satisfaction of helping
Mary's father? Something more. The accidents of the morning had
helped his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) frustrated imagination to shape an employment for himself
which had several attractions. I am not sure that certain fibres in
Mr. Garth's mind had not resumed their old vibration towards the very
end which now revealed itself to Fred. For the effective accident is
but the touch of fire where there is oil and tow; and it always
appeared to Fred that the railway brought the needed touch. But they
went on in silence except when their business demanded speech. At
last, when they had finished and were walking away, Mr. Garth said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young fellow needn't be a B. A. to do this sort of work, eh, Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had taken to it before I had thought of being a B. A.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said
Fred. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) paused a moment, and then added, more hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think I am too old to learn your business, Mr. Garth?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My business is of many sorts, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Garth, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``A
good deal of what I know can only come from experience: you can't learn
it off as you learn things out of a book. But you are young enough to
lay a foundation yet.''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Caleb pronounced the last sentence
emphatically, but paused in some uncertainty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had been under the
impression lately that Fred had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind to enter the Church.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You do think I could do some good at it, if I were to try?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
more eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That depends,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head on one side and lowering
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) voice, with the air of a man who felt himself to be saying
something deeply religious. <div class="bookquote">``You must be sure of two things: you must
love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting
your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your
work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something
else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it
well, and not be always saying, There's this and there's that--if I had
this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man
is--I wouldn't give twopence for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>--here Caleb's mouth looked
bitter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) fingers--<div class="bookquote">``whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the prime minister
or the rick-thatcher, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't do well what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) undertook to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can never feel that I should do that in being a clergyman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said
Fred, meaning to take a step in argument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then let it alone, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``else you'll never
be easy. Or, if you _are_ easy, you'll be a poor stick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very nearly what Mary thinks about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, coloring.
<div class="bookquote">``I think you must know what I feel for Mary, Mr. Garth: I hope it does
not displease you that I have always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) better than any one
else, and that I shall never love any one as I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>The expression of Caleb's face was visibly softening while Fred spoke.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) head with a solemn slowness, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes things more serious, Fred, if you want to take Mary's
happiness into your keeping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that, Mr. Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, eagerly, <div class="bookquote">``and I would do anything
for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)_. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will never have me if I go into the Church;
and I shall be the most miserable devil in the world if I lose all hope
of Mary. Really, if I could get some other profession,
business--anything that I am at all fit for, I would work hard, I would
deserve your good opinion. I should like to have to do with outdoor
things. I know a good deal about land and cattle already. I used to
believe, you know--though you will think me rather foolish for it--that
I should have land of my own. I am sure knowledge of that sort would
come easily to me, especially if I could be under you in any way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, having the image of <div class="bookquote">``Susan''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>before his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
eyes. <div class="bookquote">``What have you said to your father about all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, yet; but I must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I am only waiting to know what I
can do instead of entering the Church. I am very sorry to disappoint
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but a man ought to be allowed to judge for himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
four-and-twenty. How could I know when I was fifteen, what it would be
right for me to do now? My education was a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But hearken to this, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb. <div class="bookquote">``Are you sure Mary is fond of
you, or would ever have you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I asked Mr. Farebrother to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had forbidden
me--I didn't know what else to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, apologetically. <div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
says that I have every reason to hope, if I can put myself in an
honorable position--I mean, out of the Church. I dare say you think it
unwarrantable in me, Mr. Garth, to be troubling you and obtruding my
own wishes about Mary, before I have done anything at all for myself.
Of course I have not the least claim--indeed, I have already a debt to
you which will never be discharged, even when I have been, able to pay
it in the shape of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my boy, you have a claim,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with much feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
voice. <div class="bookquote">``The young ones have always a claim on the old to help them
forward. I was young myself once and had to do without much help; but
help would have been welcome to me, if it had been only for the
fellow-feeling's sake. But I must consider. Come to me to-morrow at
the office, at nine o'clock. At the office, mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Garth would take no important step without consulting Susan, but it
must be confessed that before he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) reached home he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
resolution. With regard to a large number of matters about which other
men are decided or obstinate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was the most easily manageable man in
the world. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) never knew what meat he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would choose, and if Susan had
said that they ought to live in a four-roomed cottage, in order to
save, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would have said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>without inquiring into details.
But where Caleb's feeling and judgment strongly pronounced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was a
ruler; and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) mildness and timidity in reproving, every
one about him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) knew that on the exceptional occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) chose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
was absolute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) never, indeed, chose to be absolute except on some
one else's behalf. On ninety-nine points Mrs. Garth decided, but on
the hundredth she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was often aware that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would have to perform the
singularly difficult task of carrying out her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) own principle, and to
make herself subordinate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is come round as I thought, Susan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, when they were
seated alone in the evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had already narrated the adventure
which had brought about Fred's sharing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) work, but had kept back
the further result. <div class="bookquote">``The children _are_ fond of each other--I mean,
Fred and Mary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garth laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) work on her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) knee, and fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) penetrating eyes
anxiously on her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After we'd done our work, Fred poured it all out to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) can't bear
to be a clergyman, and Mary says she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) is one; and
the lad would like to be under me and give his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind to business. And
I've determined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) and make a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caleb!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, in a deep contralto, expressive of resigned
astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's a fine thing to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Garth, settling himself firmly
against the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) chair, and grasping the elbows. <div class="bookquote">``I shall have
trouble with him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), but I think I shall carry it through. The lad loves
Mary, and a true love for a good woman is a great thing, Susan. It
shapes many a rough fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has Mary spoken to you on the subject?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Garth, secretly a
little hurt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had to be informed on it herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a word. I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) about Fred once; I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a bit of a
warning. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) assured me she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never marry an idle
self-indulgent man--nothing since. But it seems Fred set on Mr.
Farebrother to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had forbidden him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to speak
himself, and Mr. Farebrother has found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is fond of Fred,
but says he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must not be a clergyman. Fred's heart is fixed on Mary,
that I can see: it gives me a good opinion of the lad--and we always
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), Susan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity for Mary, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why--a pity?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, Caleb, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) might have had a man who is worth twenty Fred
Vincy's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, with surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I firmly believe that Mr. Farebrother is attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and meant to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) an offer; but of course, now that Fred has used him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) as an
envoy, there is an end to that better prospect.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>There was a severe
precision in Mrs. Garth's utterance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was vexed and disappointed,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was bent on abstaining from useless words.

<p/>Caleb was silent a few moments under a conflict of feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) looked
at the floor and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head and hands in accompaniment to some
inward argumentation. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would have made me very proud and happy, Susan, and I should have
been glad for your sake. I've always felt that your belongings have
never been on a level with you. But you took me, though I was a plain
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took the best and cleverest man I had ever known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth,
convinced that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)_ would never have loved any one who came short of
that mark.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, perhaps others thought you might have done better. But it would
have been worse for me. And that is what touches me close about Fred.
The lad is good at bottom, and clever enough to do, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)'s put in the
right way; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) loves and honors my daughter beyond anything, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
has given him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a sort of promise according to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) turns out. I say,
that young man's soul is in my hand; and I'll do the best I can for
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so help me God! It's my duty, Susan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garth was not given to tears, but there was a large one rolling
down her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) face before her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband had finished. It came from the
pressure of various feelings, in which there was much affection and
some vexation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) wiped it away quickly, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Few men besides you would think it a duty to add to their anxieties in
that way, Caleb.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That signifies nothing--what other men would think. I've got a clear
feeling inside me, and that I shall follow; and I hope your heart will
go with me, Susan, in making everything as light as can be to Mary,
poor child.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) chair, looked with anxious appeal towards
his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rose and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Caleb! Our
children have a good father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went out and had a hearty cry to make up for the suppression of
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) words. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's conduct would be
misunderstood, and about Fred she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was rational and unhopeful. Which
would turn out to have the more foresight in it--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rationality or
Caleb's ardent generosity?

<p/>When Fred went to the office the next morning, there was a test to be
gone through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was not prepared for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, <div class="bookquote">``you will have some desk-work. I have always
done a good deal of writing myself, but I can't do without help, and as
I want you to understand the accounts and get the values into your
head, I mean to do without another clerk. So you must buckle to. How
are you at writing and arithmetic?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred felt an awkward movement of the heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not thought of
desk-work; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was in a resolute mood, and not going to shrink.
<div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of arithmetic, Mr. Garth: it always came easily to me.
I think you know my writing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, taking up a pen, examining it carefully and
handing it, well dipped, to Fred with a sheet of ruled paper. <div class="bookquote">``Copy me
a line or two of that valuation, with the figures at the end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>At that time the opinion existed that it was beneath a gentleman to
write legibly, or with a hand in the least suitable to a clerk. Fred
wrote the lines demanded in a hand as gentlemanly as that of any
viscount or bishop of the day: the vowels were all alike and the
consonants only distinguishable as turning up or down, the strokes had
a blotted solidity and the letters disdained to keep the line--in
short, it was a manuscript of that venerable kind easy to interpret
when you know beforehand what the writer means.

<p/>As Caleb looked on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) visage showed a growing depression, but when
Fred handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the paper he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gave something like a snarl, and rapped
the paper passionately with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hand. Bad work like this
dispelled all Caleb's mildness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The deuce!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) exclaimed, snarlingly. <div class="bookquote">``To think that this is a
country where a man's education may cost hundreds and hundreds, and it
turns you out this!''  (<font color='red'><b>the scribe</b></font>)</div>Then in a more pathetic tone, pushing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
spectacles and looking at the unfortunate scribe, <div class="bookquote">``The Lord have mercy
on us, Fred, I can't put up with this!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the scribe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can I do, Mr. Garth?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, whose spirits had sunk very low,
not only at the estimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) handwriting, but at the vision of
himself as liable to be ranked with office clerks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do? Why, you must learn to form your letters and keep the line.
What's the use of writing at all if nobody can understand it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>asked
Caleb, energetically, quite preoccupied with the bad quality of the
work. <div class="bookquote">``Is there so little business in the world that you must be
sending puzzles over the country? But that's the way people are
brought up. I should lose no end of time with the letters some people
send me, if Susan did not make them out for me. It's disgusting.''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Here
Caleb tossed the paper from him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>).

<p/>Any stranger peeping into the office at that moment might have wondered
what was the drama between the indignant man of business, and the
fine-looking young fellow whose blond complexion was getting rather
patchy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip with mortification. Fred was struggling with
many thoughts. Mr. Garth had been so kind and encouraging at the
beginning of their interview, that gratitude and hopefulness had been
at a high pitch, and the downfall was proportionate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had not
thought of desk-work--in fact, like the majority of young gentlemen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
wanted an occupation which should be free from disagreeables. I cannot
tell what might have been the consequences if he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had not distinctly
promised himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would go to Lowick to see Mary and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was engaged to work under her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did not like to
disappoint himself there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were all the words that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could muster. But Mr.
Garth was already relenting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We must make the best of it, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) began, with a return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
usual quiet tone. <div class="bookquote">``Every man can learn to write. I taught myself. Go
at it with a will, and sit up at night if the day-time isn't enough.
We'll be patient, my boy. Callum shall go on with the books for a bit,
while you are learning. But now I must be off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, rising.
<div class="bookquote">``You must let your father know our agreement. You'll save me Callum's
salary, you know, when you can write; and I can afford to give you
eighty pounds for the first year, and more after.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>When Fred made the necessary disclosure to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) parents, the relative
effect on the two was a surprise which entered very deeply into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
memory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) went straight from Mr. Garth's office to the warehouse,
rightly feeling that the most respectful way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could behave
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) father was to make the painful communication as gravely and
formally as possible. Moreover, the decision would be more certainly
understood to be final, if the interview took place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) father's
gravest hours, which were always those spent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) private room at the
warehouse.

<p/>Fred entered on the subject directly, and declared briefly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had
done and was resolved to do, expressing at the end his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
should be the cause of disappointment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, and taking the
blame on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own deficiencies. The regret was genuine, and inspired
Fred with strong, simple words.

<p/>Mr. Vincy listened in profound surprise without uttering even an
exclamation, a silence which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) impatient temperament was a sign of
unusual emotion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had not been in good spirits about trade that
morning, and the slight bitterness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) lips grew intense as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
listened. When Fred had ended, there was a pause of nearly a minute,
during which Mr. Vincy replaced a book in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) desk and turned the key
emphatically. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) son steadily, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So you've made up your mind at last, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; stick to it. I've no more to say. You've thrown away your
education, and gone down a step in life, when I had given you the means
of rising, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry that we differ, father. I think I can be quite as
much of a gentleman at the work I have undertaken, as if I had been a
curate. But I am grateful to you for wishing to do the best for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well; I have no more to say. I wash my hands of you. I only
hope, when you have a son of your own he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will make a better return for
the pains you spend on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>This was very cutting to Fred. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father was using that unfair
advantage possessed by us all when we are in a pathetic situation and
see our own past as if it were simply part of the pathos. In reality,
Mr. Vincy's wishes about his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) son had had a great deal of pride,
inconsiderateness, and egoistic folly in them. But still the
disappointed father held a strong lever; and Fred felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) were
being banished with a malediction.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will not object to my remaining at home, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said,
after rising to go; <div class="bookquote">``I shall have a sufficient salary to pay for my
board, as of course I should wish to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Board be hanged!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, recovering himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) disgust at
the notion that Fred's keep would be missed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) table. <div class="bookquote">``Of course
your mother will want you to stay. But I shall keep no horse for you,
you understand; and you will pay your own tailor. You will do with a
suit or two less, I fancy, when you have to pay for 'em.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred lingered; there was still something to be said. At last it came.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will shake hands with me, father, and forgive me the
vexation I have caused you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Vincy from his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) chair threw a quick glance upward at his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) son, who
had advanced near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), and then gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) hand, saying hurriedly,
<div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, let us say no more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred went through much more narrative and explanation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was inconsolable, having before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes what perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
husband had never thought of, the certainty that Fred would marry Mary
Garth, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) life would henceforth be spoiled by a perpetual
infusion of Garths and their ways, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) darling boy, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
beautiful face and stylish air <div class="bookquote">``beyond anybody else's son in
Middlemarch,''  (<font color='red'><b>darling boy</b></font>)</div>would be sure to get like that family in plainness of
appearance and carelessness about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clothes. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) it seemed that
there was a Garth conspiracy to get possession of the desirable Fred,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) dared not enlarge on this opinion, because a slight hint of it
had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``fly out''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>at her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had never done before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) temper
was too sweet for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) to show any anger, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
happiness had received a bruise, and for several days merely to look at
Fred made her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) cry a little as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) were the subject of some baleful
prophecy. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was the slower to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) usual cheerfulness
because Fred had warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) must not reopen the sore question
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) father, who had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) decision and forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). If
her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband had been vehement against Fred, she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) would have been urged
into defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) darling. It was the end of the fourth day when Mr.
Vincy said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Lucy, my dear, don't be so down-hearted. You always have spoiled
the boy, and you must go on spoiling him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing ever did cut me so before, Vincy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife throat beginning</b></font>)</div>said the wife, her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) fair
throat and chin beginning to tremble again, <div class="bookquote">``only his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the wife throat beginning</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pooh, pooh, never mind! We must expect to have trouble with our
children. Don't make it worse by letting me see you out of spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, roused by this appeal and adjusting
herself with a little shake as of a bird which lays down its ruffled
plumage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It won't do to begin making a fuss about one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, wishing
to combine a little grumbling with domestic cheerfulness. <div class="bookquote">``There's
Rosamond as well as Fred.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor thing. I'm sure I felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) being disappointed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
baby; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) got over it nicely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Baby, pooh! I can see Lydgate is making a mess of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice, and
getting into debt too, by what I hear. I shall have Rosamond coming to
me with a pretty tale one of these days. But they'll get no money from
me, I know. Let _his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)_ family help him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). I never did like that
marriage. But it's no use talking. Ring the bell for lemons, and
don't look dull any more, Lucy. I'll drive you and Louisa to Riverston
to-morrow.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LVII.

<p/>They numbered scarce eight summers when a name
Rose on their souls and stirred such motions there
As thrill the buds and shape their hidden frame
At penetration of the quickening air:
His (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) name who told of loyal Evan Dhu,
Of quaint Bradwardine, and Vich Ian Vor,
Making the little world their childhood knew
Large with a land of mountain lake and scaur,
And larger yet with wonder love belief
Toward Walter Scott who living far away
Sent them this wealth of joy and noble grief.
The book and they must part, but day by day,
In lines that thwart like portly spiders ran
They wrote the tale, from Tully Veolan.


<p/>The evening that Fred Vincy walked to Lowick parsonage -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had begun to
see that this was a world in which even a spirited young man must
sometimes walk for want of a horse to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out at five
o'clock and called on Mrs. Garth by the way, wishing to assure himself
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) accepted their new relations willingly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found the family group, dogs and cats included, under the great
apple-tree in the orchard. It was a festival with Mrs. Garth, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
eldest son, Christy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) peculiar joy and pride, had come home for a
short holiday--Christy, who held it the most desirable thing in the
world to be a tutor, to study all literatures and be a regenerate
Porson, and who was an incorporate criticism on poor Fred, a sort of
object-lesson given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) by the educational mother. Christy himself,
a square-browed, broad-shouldered masculine edition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother not
much higher than Fred's shoulder--which made it the harder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
should be held superior--was always as simple as possible, and thought
no more of Fred's disinclination to scholarship than of a giraffe's,
wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) himself were more of the same height. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was lying on
the ground now by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother's chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) straw hat laid flat over
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes, while Jim on the other side was reading aloud from that
beloved writer who has made a chief part in the happiness of many young
lives. The volume was <div class="bookquote">``Ivanhoe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim</b></font>)</div>and Jim was in the great archery
scene at the tournament, but suffered much interruption from Ben, who
had fetched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) own old bow and arrows, and was making himself
dreadfully disagreeable, Letty thought, by begging all present to
observe his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) random shots, which no one wished to do except Brownie, the
active-minded but probably shallow mongrel, while the grizzled
Newfoundland lying in the sun looked on with the dull-eyed neutrality
of extreme old age. Letty herself, showing as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) mouth and
pinafore some slight signs that she (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) had been assisting at the gathering
of the cherries which stood in a coral-heap on the tea-table, was now
seated on the grass, listening open-eyed to the reading.

<p/>But the centre of interest was changed for all by the arrival of Fred
Vincy. When, seating himself on a garden-stool, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) way to Lowick Parsonage, Ben, who had thrown down his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) bow, and
snatched up a reluctant half-grown kitten instead, strode across Fred's
outstretched leg, and said <div class="bookquote">``Take me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, and me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>said Letty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't keep up with Fred and me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>said Ben.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I can. Mother, please say that I am to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Letty</b></font>)</div>urged Letty, whose
life was much checkered by resistance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) depreciation as a girl.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall stay with Christy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim</b></font>)</div>observed Jim; as much as to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)
had the advantage of those simpletons; whereupon Letty put her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) hand up
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) head and looked with jealous indecision from the one to the
other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us all go and see Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Christy</b></font>)</div>said Christy, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) arms.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, my dear child, we must not go in a swarm to the parsonage. And
that old Glasgow suit of yours would never do. Besides, your father
will come home. We must let Fred go alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) can tell Mary that you
are here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will come back to-morrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Christy</b></font>)</div><p/>Christy glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) own threadbare knees, and then at Fred's
beautiful white trousers. Certainly Fred's tailoring suggested the
advantages of an English university, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a graceful way even of
looking warm and of pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hair back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Children, run away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth; <div class="bookquote">``it is too warm to hang about
your friends. Take your brother and show him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the rabbits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>The eldest understood, and led off the children immediately. Fred felt
that Mrs. Garth wished to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) an opportunity of saying anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
had to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could only begin by observing--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How glad you must be to have Christy here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has come sooner than I expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) got down from the coach
at nine o'clock, just after his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father went out. I am longing for
Caleb to come and hear what wonderful progress Christy is making. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
has paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) expenses for the last year by giving lessons, carrying on
hard study at the same time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hopes soon to get a private tutorship
and go abroad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) is a great fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, to whom these cheerful truths had a
medicinal taste, <div class="bookquote">``and no trouble to anybody.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>After a slight pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
added, <div class="bookquote">``But I fear you will think that I am going to be a great deal of
trouble to Mr. Garth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Caleb likes taking trouble: he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) is one of those men who always do more
than any one would have thought of asking them to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs.
Garth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was knitting, and could either look at Fred or not, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
chose--always an advantage when one is bent on loading speech with
salutary meaning; and though Mrs. Garth intended to be duly reserved,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did wish to say something that Fred might be the better for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you think me very undeserving, Mrs. Garth, and with good
reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) spirit rising a little at the perception of
something like a disposition to lecture him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I happen to have behaved
just the worst to the people I can't help wishing for the most from.
But while two men like Mr. Garth and Mr. Farebrother have not given me
up, I don't see why I should give myself up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred thought it might be
well to suggest these masculine examples to Mrs. Garth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Assuredly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), with gathering emphasis. <div class="bookquote">``A young man for whom
two such elders had devoted themselves would indeed be culpable if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
threw himself away and made their sacrifices vain.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred wondered a little at this strong language, but only said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope
it will not be so with me, Mrs. Garth, since I have some encouragement
to believe that I may win Mary. Mr. Garth has told you about that?
You were not surprised, I dare say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred ended, innocently referring
only to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own love as probably evident enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not surprised that Mary has given you encouragement?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs.
Garth, who thought it would be well for Fred to be more alive to the
fact that Mary's friends could not possibly have wished this
beforehand, whatever the Vincys might suppose. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I confess I was
surprised.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never did give me any--not the least in the world, when I talked
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, eager to vindicate Mary. <div class="bookquote">``But when I asked
Mr. Farebrother to speak for me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) to tell me there was a
hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>The power of admonition which had begun to stir in Mrs. Garth had not
yet discharged itself. It was a little too provoking even for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)_
self-control that this blooming youngster should flourish on the
disappointments of sadder and wiser people--making a meal of a
nightingale and never knowing it--and that all the while his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) family
should suppose that hers was in eager need of this sprig; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
vexation had fermented the more actively because of its total
repression towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband. Exemplary wives will sometimes find
scapegoats in this way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) now said with energetic decision, <div class="bookquote">``You
made a great mistake, Fred, in asking Mr. Farebrother to speak for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, reddening instantaneously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was alarmed, but at
a loss to know what Mrs. Garth meant, and added, in an apologetic tone,
<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Farebrother has always been such a friend of ours; and Mary, I
knew, would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) gravely; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) took it on himself quite
readily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, young people are usually blind to everything but their own
wishes, and seldom imagine how much those wishes cost others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Garth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did not mean to go beyond this salutary general
doctrine, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) indignation into a needless unwinding of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
worsted, knitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) brow at it with a grand air.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive how it could be any pain to Mr. Farebrother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said
Fred, who nevertheless felt that surprising conceptions were beginning
to form themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely; you cannot conceive,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, cutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) words as
neatly as possible.

<p/>For a moment Fred looked at the horizon with a dismayed anxiety, and
then turning with a quick movement said almost sharply--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to say, Mrs. Garth, that Mr. Farebrother is in love with
Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if it were so, Fred, I think you are the last person who ought to
be surprised,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Garth, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) knitting down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
and folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) arms. It was an unwonted sign of emotion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) should put her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) work out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) hands. In fact her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) feelings were
divided between the satisfaction of giving Fred his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) discipline and the
sense of having gone a little too far. Fred took his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hat and stick and
rose quickly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you think I am standing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) way, and in Mary's too?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said,
in a tone which seemed to demand an answer.

<p/>Mrs. Garth could not speak immediately. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had brought herself into
the unpleasant position of being called on to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) really felt,
yet what she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) knew there were strong reasons for concealing. And to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
the consciousness of having exceeded in words was peculiarly
mortifying. Besides, Fred had given out unexpected electricity, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
now added, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Garth seemed pleased that Mary should be attached to
me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could not have known anything of this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Garth felt a severe twinge at this mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband, the
fear that Caleb might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) in the wrong not being easily
endurable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) answered, wanting to check unintended consequences--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I spoke from inference only. I am not aware that Mary knows anything
of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) hesitated to beg that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) would keep entire silence on a subject
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had herself unnecessarily mentioned, not being used to stoop
in that way; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was hesitating there was already a rush of
unintended consequences under the apple-tree where the tea-things
stood. Ben, bouncing across the grass with Brownie at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) heels, and
seeing the kitten dragging the knitting by a lengthening line of wool,
shouted and clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) hands; Brownie barked, the kitten, desperate,
jumped on the tea-table and upset the milk, then jumped down again and
swept half the cherries with it; and Ben, snatching up the half-knitted
sock-top, fitted it over the kitten's head as a new source of madness,
while Letty arriving cried out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) mother against this cruelty--it
was a history as full of sensation as <div class="bookquote">``This is the house that Jack
built.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Garth was obliged to interfere, the other young ones came
up and the tete-a-tete with Fred was ended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) got away as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
could, and Mrs. Garth could only imply some retractation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
severity by saying <div class="bookquote">``God bless you''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was unpleasantly conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had been on the verge of
speaking as <div class="bookquote">``one of the foolish women speaketh'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--telling first and
entreating silence after. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had not entreated silence, and to
prevent Caleb's blame she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) determined to blame herself and confess all
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) that very night. It was curious what an awful tribunal the mild
Caleb's was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) set it up. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) meant to point out
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) that the revelation might do Fred Vincy a great deal of good.

<p/>No doubt it was having a strong effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) walked to Lowick.
Fred's light hopeful nature had perhaps never had so much of a bruise
as from this suggestion that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had been out of the way Mary might
have made a thoroughly good match. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was piqued that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had been
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) called such a stupid lout as to ask that intervention from Mr.
Farebrother. But it was not in a lover's nature--it was not in
Fred's, that the new anxiety raised about Mary's feeling should not
surmount every other. Notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) trust in Mr. Farebrother's
generosity, notwithstanding what Mary had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), Fred could not
help feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a rival: it was a new consciousness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
objected to it extremely, not being in the least ready to give up Mary
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) good, being ready rather to fight for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with any man
whatsoever. But the fighting with Mr. Farebrother must be of a
metaphorical kind, which was much more difficult to Fred than the
muscular. Certainly this experience was a discipline for Fred hardly
less sharp than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) disappointment about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) uncle's will. The iron
had not entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) soul, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had begun to imagine what the
sharp edge would be. It did not once occur to Fred that Mrs. Garth
might be mistaken about Mr. Farebrother, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) suspected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
might be wrong about Mary. Mary had been staying at the parsonage
lately, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother might know very little of what had been passing
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) did not feel easier when he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) looking cheerful with the
three ladies in the drawing-room. They were in animated discussion on
some subject which was dropped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) entered, and Mary was copying
the labels from a heap of shallow cabinet drawers, in a minute
handwriting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was skilled in. Mr. Farebrother was somewhere in
the village, and the three ladies knew nothing of Fred's peculiar
relation to Mary: it was impossible for either of them to propose that
they should walk round the garden, and Fred predicted to himself that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should have to go away without saying a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in private. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) first of Christy's arrival and then of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own engagement with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) father; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was comforted by seeing that this latter news
touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) keenly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) said hurriedly, <div class="bookquote">``I am so glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and then bent
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) writing to hinder any one from noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) face. But here
was a subject which Mrs. Farebrother could not let pass.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean, my dear Miss Garth, that you are glad to hear of a
young man giving up the Church for which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was educated: you only mean
that things being so, you are glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be under an excellent
man like your father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, really, Mrs. Farebrother, I am glad of both, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary,
cleverly getting rid of one rebellious tear. <div class="bookquote">``I have a dreadfully
secular mind. I never liked any clergyman except the Vicar of
Wakefield and Mr. Farebrother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now why, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, pausing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) large wooden
knitting-needles and looking at Mary. <div class="bookquote">``You have always a good reason
for your opinions, but this astonishes me. Of course I put out of the
question those who preach new doctrine. But why should you dislike
clergymen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face breaking into merriment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to
consider a moment, <div class="bookquote">``I don't like their neckcloths.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't like Camden's, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Winifred</b></font>)</div>said Miss Winifred, in some
anxiety.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I don't like the other clergymen's
neckcloths, because it is they who wear them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How very puzzling!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Noble, feeling that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own intellect
was probably deficient.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you are joking. You would have better reasons than these for
slighting so respectable a class of men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother,
majestically.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Garth has such severe notions of what people should be that it is
difficult to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am glad at least that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) makes an exception in favor of my
son,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the old lady.

<p/>Mary was wondering at Fred's piqued tone, when Mr. Farebrother came in
and had to hear the news about the engagement under Mr. Garth. At the
end he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) said with quiet satisfaction, <div class="bookquote">''_That_ is right;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then bent
to look at Mary's labels and praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) handwriting. Fred felt
horribly jealous--was glad, of course, that Mr. Farebrother was so
estimable, but wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had been ugly and fat as men at forty
sometimes are. It was clear what the end would be, since Mary openly
placed Farebrother above everybody, and these women were all evidently
encouraging the affair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was feeling sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) should have no
chance of speaking to Mary, when Mr. Farebrother said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred, help me to carry these drawers back into my study--you have
never seen my fine new study. Pray come too, Miss Garth. I want you
to see a stupendous spider I found this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary at once saw the Vicar's intention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had never since the
memorable evening deviated from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) old pastoral kindness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) momentary wonder and doubt had quite gone to sleep. Mary was
accustomed to think rather rigorously of what was probable, and if a
belief flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) vanity she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt warned to dismiss it as
ridiculous, having early had much exercise in such dismissals. It was
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had foreseen: when Fred had been asked to admire the fittings of
the study, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been asked to admire the spider, Mr. Farebrother
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait here a minute or two. I am going to look out an engraving which
Fred is tall enough to hang for me. I shall be back in a few minutes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) went out. Nevertheless, the first word Fred said to Mary
was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is of no use, whatever I do, Mary. You are sure to marry
Farebrother at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>There was some rage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean, Fred?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary exclaimed indignantly, blushing deeply,
and surprised out of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) readiness in reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible that you should not see it all clearly enough--you
who see everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only see that you are behaving very ill, Fred, in speaking so of Mr.
Farebrother after he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) has pleaded your cause in every way. How can you
have taken up such an idea?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred was rather deep, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) irritation. If Mary had really
been unsuspicious, there was no good in telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what Mrs. Garth had
said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It follows as a matter of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``When you are
continually seeing a man who beats me in everything, and whom you set
up above everybody, I can have no fair chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very ungrateful, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had never told
Mr. Farebrother that I cared for you in the least.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I am not ungrateful; I should be the happiest fellow in the world
if it were not for this. I told your father everything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
very kind; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) treated me as if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son. I could go at the work
with a will, writing and everything, if it were not for this.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For this? for what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, imagining now that something specific
must have been said or done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This dreadful certainty that I shall be bowled out by Farebrother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary was appeased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) inclination to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, peeping round to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) eyes, which were sulkily
turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are too delightfully ridiculous. If you
were not such a charming simpleton, what a temptation this would be to
play the wicked coquette, and let you suppose that somebody besides you
has made love to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you really like me best, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, turning eyes full of
affection on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and trying to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like you at all at this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, retreating, and
putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I only said that no mortal ever made
love to me besides you. And that is no argument that a very wise man
ever will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ended, merrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me that you could not possibly ever think of
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never dare to mention this any more to me, Fred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, getting
serious again. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether it is more stupid or ungenerous
in you not to see that Mr. Farebrother has left us together on purpose
that we might speak freely. I am disappointed that you should be so
blind to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) delicate feeling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no time to say any more before Mr. Farebrother came back with
the engraving; and Fred had to return to the drawing-room still with a
jealous dread in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) heart, but yet with comforting arguments from
Mary's words and manner. The result of the conversation was on the
whole more painful to Mary: inevitably her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attention had taken a new
attitude, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) saw the possibility of new interpretations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
in a position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seemed to herself to be slighting Mr.
Farebrother, and this, in relation to a man who is much honored, is
always dangerous to the firmness of a grateful woman. To have a reason
for going home the next day was a relief, for Mary earnestly desired to
be always clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) loved Fred best. When a tender affection has
been storing itself in us through many of our years, the idea that we
could accept any exchange for it seems to be a cheapening of our lives.
And we can set a watch over our affections and our constancy as we can
over other treasures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred has lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) other expectations; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) must keep this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary
said to herself, with a smile curling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips. It was impossible to
help fleeting visions of another kind--new dignities and an
acknowledged value of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had often felt the absence. But these
things with Fred outside them, Fred forsaken and looking sad for the
want of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), could never tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) deliberate thought.



<p/>CHAPTER LVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change:
In many's looks the false heart's history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange:
But Heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell:
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: Sonnets.


<p/>At the time when Mr. Vincy uttered that presentiment about Rosamond,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) herself had never had the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should be driven to make
the sort of appeal which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) foresaw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had not yet had any anxiety
about ways and means, although her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) domestic life had been expensive as
well as eventful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) baby had been born prematurely, and all the
embroidered robes and caps had to be laid by in darkness. This
misfortune was attributed entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) having persisted in going out
on horseback one day when her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband had desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) not to do so; but
it must not be supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had shown temper on the occasion, or
rudely told him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) liked.

<p/>What led her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) particularly to desire horse-exercise was a visit from
Captain Lydgate, the baronet's third son, who, I am sorry to say, was
detested by our Tertius of that name as a vapid fop <div class="bookquote">``parting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hair
from brow to nape in a despicable fashion''  (<font color='red'><b>a fop parting</b></font>)</div>-LRB-not followed by Tertius
himself-RRB-, and showing an ignorant security that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew the proper
thing to say on every topic. Lydgate inwardly cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own folly
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had drawn down this visit by consenting to go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) uncle's on
the wedding-tour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) made himself rather disagreeable to Rosamond
by saying so in private. For to Rosamond this visit was a source of
unprecedented but gracefully concealed exultation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was so
intensely conscious of having a cousin who was a baronet's son staying
in the house, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) imagined the knowledge of what was implied by
his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) presence to be diffused through all other minds; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
introduced Captain Lydgate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) guests, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had a placid sense that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rank penetrated them as if it had been an odor. The satisfaction
was enough for the time to melt away some disappointment in the
conditions of marriage with a medical man even of good birth: it seemed
now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) marriage was visibly as well as ideally floating her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) above
the Middlemarch level, and the future looked bright with letters and
visits to and from Quallingham, and vague advancement in consequence
for Tertius. Especially as, probably at the Captain's suggestion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
married sister, Mrs. Mengan, had come with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) maid, and stayed two
nights on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) way from town. Hence it was clearly worth while for
Rosamond to take pains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) music and the careful selection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
lace.

<p/>As to Captain Lydgate himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) low brow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) aquiline nose bent on
one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rather heavy utterance, might have been
disadvantageous in any young gentleman who had not a military bearing
and mustache to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) what is doted on by some flower-like blond
heads as <div class="bookquote">``style.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had, moreover, that sort of high-breeding which
consists in being free from the petty solicitudes of middle-class
gentility, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a great critic of feminine charms. Rosamond
delighted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) admiration now even more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had done at
Quallingham, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) found it easy to spend several hours of the day in
flirting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). The visit altogether was one of the pleasantest
larks he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had ever had, not the less so perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) suspected
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) queer cousin Tertius wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) away: though Lydgate, who
would rather -LRB-hyperbolically speaking-RRB- have died than have failed in
polite hospitality, suppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dislike, and only pretended
generally not to hear what the gallant officer said, consigning the
task of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to Rosamond. For he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was not at all a jealous
husband, and preferred leaving a feather-headed young gentleman alone
with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife to bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) company.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would talk more to the Captain at dinner, Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, one evening when the important guest was gone to Loamford to
see some brother officers stationed there. <div class="bookquote">``You really look so absent
sometimes--you seem to be seeing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head into something behind
it, instead of looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Rosy, you don't expect me to talk much to such a conceited ass
as that, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, brusquely. <div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) head broken,
I might look at it with interest, not before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot conceive why you should speak of your cousin so
contemptuously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fingers moving at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) work while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke with a mild gravity which had a touch of disdain in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask Ladislaw if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) doesn't think your Captain the greatest bore he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
ever met with. Ladislaw has almost forsaken the house since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) came.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew perfectly well why Mr. Ladislaw disliked the
Captain: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was jealous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) being jealous.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to say what will suit eccentric persons,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
answered, <div class="bookquote">``but in my opinion Captain Lydgate is a thorough gentleman,
and I think you ought not, out of respect to Sir Godwin, to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>)
with neglect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear; but we have had dinners for him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) comes in and goes
out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) likes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) doesn't want me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Still, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) is in the room, you might show him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) more attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>)
may not be a phoenix of cleverness in your sense; his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) profession is
different; but it would be all the better for you to talk a little on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) subjects. _I_ think his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) conversation is quite agreeable. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>)
is anything but an unprincipled man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fact is, you would wish me to be a little more like him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>), Rosy,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in a sort of resigned murmur, with a smile which was not
exactly tender, and certainly not merry. Rosamond was silent and did
not smile again; but the lovely curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face looked good-tempered
enough without smiling.

<p/>Those words of Lydgate's were like a sad milestone marking how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had travelled from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared
to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) husband's
mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) comb and
looking-glass and singing her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) song for the relaxation of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) adored
wisdom alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had begun to distinguish between that imagined
adoration and the attraction towards a man's talent because it gives
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prestige, and is like an order in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) button-hole or an Honorable
before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.

<p/>It might have been supposed that Rosamond had travelled too, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had found the pointless conversation of Mr. Ned Plymdale perfectly
wearisome; but to most mortals there is a stupidity which is
unendurable and a stupidity which is altogether acceptable--else,
indeed, what would become of social bonds? Captain Lydgate's stupidity
was delicately scented, carried itself with <div class="bookquote">``style,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>talked with a good
accent, and was closely related to Sir Godwin. Rosamond found it quite
agreeable and caught many of its phrases.

<p/>Therefore since Rosamond, as we know, was fond of horseback, there were
plenty of reasons why she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should be tempted to resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) riding when
Captain Lydgate, who had ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) man with two horses to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
and put up at the <div class="bookquote">``Green Dragon,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to go out on the gray
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) warranted to be gentle and trained to carry a lady--indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had bought it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sister, and was taking it to Quallingham.
Rosamond went out the first time without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, and came
back before his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) return; but the ride had been so thorough a success,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) declared herself so much the better in consequence, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
informed of it with full reliance on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consent that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should go
riding again.

<p/>On the contrary Lydgate was more than hurt--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was utterly confounded
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had risked herself on a strange horse without referring the
matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wish. After the first almost thundering exclamations of
astonishment, which sufficiently warned Rosamond of what was coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was silent for some moments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``However, you have come back safely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, at last, in a decisive
tone. <div class="bookquote">``You will not go again, Rosy; that is understood. If it were
the quietest, most familiar horse in the world, there would always be
the chance of accident. And you know very well that I wished you to
give up riding the roan on that account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But there is the chance of accident indoors, Tertius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My darling, don't talk nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in an imploring tone;
<div class="bookquote">``surely I am the person to judge for you. I think it is enough that I
say you are not to go again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond was arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hair before dinner, and the reflection of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head in the glass showed no change in its loveliness except a
little turning aside of the long neck. Lydgate had been moving about
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pockets, and now paused near her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
awaited some assurance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would fasten up my plaits, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, letting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) arms fall with a little sigh, so as to make a husband ashamed of
standing there like a brute. Lydgate had often fastened the plaits
before, being among the deftest of men with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) large finely formed
fingers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) swept up the soft festoons of plaits and fastened in the
tall comb -LRB-to such uses do men come!-RRB-; and what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) do then but
kiss the exquisite nape which was shown in all its delicate curves?
But when we do what we have done before, it is often with a difference.
Lydgate was still angry, and had not forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) point.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall tell the Captain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ought to have known better than offer
you his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) horse,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you will not do anything of the kind, Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with something more marked than usual in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) speech.
<div class="bookquote">``It will be treating me as if I were a child. Promise that you will
leave the subject to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There did seem to be some truth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) objection. Lydgate said, <div class="bookquote">``Very
well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>with a surly obedience, and thus the discussion ended with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
promising Rosamond, and not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been determined not to promise. Rosamond had that
victorious obstinacy which never wastes its energy in impetuous
resistance. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) liked to do was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) the right thing, and all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) cleverness was directed to getting the means of doing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
meant to go out riding again on the gray, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did go on the next
opportunity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's absence, not intending that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should know
until it was late enough not to signify to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). The temptation was
certainly great: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was very fond of the exercise, and the
gratification of riding on a fine horse, with Captain Lydgate, Sir
Godwin's son, on another fine horse by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) side, and of being met in
this position by any one but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, was something as good as her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
dreams before marriage: moreover she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was riveting the connection with
the family at Quallingham, which must be a wise thing to do.

<p/>But the gentle gray, unprepared for the crash of a tree that was being
felled on the edge of Halsell wood, took fright, and caused a worse
fright to Rosamond, leading finally to the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) baby. Lydgate
could not show his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was rather bearish to the
Captain, whose visit naturally soon came to an end.

<p/>In all future conversations on the subject, Rosamond was mildly certain
that the ride had made no difference, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had stayed at
home the same symptoms would have come on and would have ended in the
same way, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had felt something like them before.

<p/>Lydgate could only say, <div class="bookquote">``Poor, poor darling!'' (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) secretly wondered
over the terrible tenacity of this mild creature. There was gathering
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) an amazed sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) powerlessness over Rosamond. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
superior knowledge and mental force, instead of being, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
imagined, a shrine to consult on all occasions, was simply set aside on
every practical question. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had regarded Rosamond's cleverness as
precisely of the receptive kind which became a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was now
beginning to find out what that cleverness was--what was the shape into
which it had run as into a close network aloof and independent. No one
quicker than Rosamond to see causes and effects which lay within the
track of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own tastes and interests: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had seen clearly Lydgate's
preeminence in Middlemarch society, and could go on imaginatively
tracing still more agreeable social effects when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) talent should have
advanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) professional and scientific ambition had
no other relation to these desirable effects than if they had been the
fortunate discovery of an ill-smelling oil. And that oil apart, with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had nothing to do, of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own opinion
more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Lydgate was astounded to find in numberless
trifling matters, as well as in this last serious case of the riding,
that affection did not make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) compliant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no doubt that the
affection was there, and had no presentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had done anything
to repel it. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own part he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as
tenderly as ever, and could make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) negations;
but--well! Lydgate was much worried, and conscious of new elements in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life as noxious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as an inlet of mud to a creature that has
been used to breathe and bathe and dart after its illuminated prey in
the clearest of waters.

<p/>Rosamond was soon looking lovelier than ever at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) worktable, enjoying
drives in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father's phaeton and thinking it likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might be
invited to Quallingham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was a much more exquisite
ornament to the drawing-room there than any daughter of the family, and
in reflecting that the gentlemen were aware of that, did not perhaps
sufficiently consider whether the ladies would be eager to see
themselves surpassed.

<p/>Lydgate, relieved from anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), relapsed into what she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
inwardly called his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) moodiness--a name which to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
thoughtful preoccupation with other subjects than herself, as well as
that uneasy look of the brow and distaste for all ordinary things as if
they were mixed with bitter herbs, which really made a sort of
weather-glass to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) vexation and foreboding. These latter states of
mind had one cause amongst others, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had generously but
mistakenly avoided mentioning to Rosamond, lest it should affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
health and spirits. Between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) indeed there was that total
missing of each other's mental track, which is too evidently possible
even between persons who are continually thinking of each other. To
Lydgate it seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been spending month after month in
sacrificing more than half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) best intent and best power to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
tenderness for Rosamond; bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) little claims and interruptions
without impatience, and, above all, bearing without betrayal of
bitterness to look through less and less of interfering illusion at the
blank unreflecting surface her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ardor for the more
impersonal ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) scientific study, an ardor
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had fancied that the ideal wife must somehow worship as
sublime, though not in the least knowing why. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) endurance was
mingled with a self-discontent which, if we know how to be candid, we
shall confess to make more than half our bitterness under grievances,
wife or husband included. It always remains true that if we had been
greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us. Lydgate
was aware that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) concessions to Rosamond were often little more than
the lapse of slackening resolution, the creeping paralysis apt to seize
an enthusiasm which is out of adjustment to a constant portion of our
lives. And on Lydgate's enthusiasm there was constantly pressing not a
simple weight of sorrow, but the biting presence of a petty degrading
care, such as casts the blight of irony over all higher effort.

<p/>This was the care which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had hitherto abstained from mentioning to
Rosamond; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) believed, with some wonder, that it had never entered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind, though certainly no difficulty could be less mysterious. It
was an inference with a conspicuous handle to it, and had been easily
drawn by indifferent observers, that Lydgate was in debt; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could
not succeed in keeping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind for long together that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
every day getting deeper into that swamp, which tempts men towards it
with such a pretty covering of flowers and verdure. It is wonderful
how soon a man gets up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin there--in a condition in which,
in spite of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is forced to think chiefly of release, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had a scheme of the universe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul.

<p/>Eighteen months ago Lydgate was poor, but had never known the eager
want of small sums, and felt rather a burning contempt for any one who
descended a step in order to gain them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was now experiencing
something worse than a simple deficit: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was assailed by the vulgar
hateful trials of a man who has bought and used a great many things
which might have been done without, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is unable to pay for,
though the demand for payment has become pressing.

<p/>How this came about may be easily seen without much arithmetic or
knowledge of prices. When a man in setting up a house and preparing
for marriage finds that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) furniture and other initial expenses come
to between four and five hundred pounds more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has capital to pay
for; when at the end of a year it appears that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) household expenses,
horses and et caeteras, amount to nearly a thousand, while the proceeds
of the practice reckoned from the old books to be worth eight hundred
per annum have sunk like a summer pond and make hardly five hundred,
chiefly in unpaid entries, the plain inference is that, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
minds it or not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in debt. Those were less expensive times than
our own, and provincial life was comparatively modest; but the ease
with which a medical man who had lately bought a practice, who thought
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was obliged to keep two horses, whose table was supplied
without stint, and who paid an insurance on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and a high rent
for house and garden, might find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expenses doubling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) receipts,
can be conceived by any one who does not think these details beneath
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consideration. Rosamond, accustomed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) childhood to an extravagant
household, thought that good housekeeping consisted simply in ordering
the best of everything--nothing else <div class="bookquote">``answered;''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>and Lydgate supposed
that <div class="bookquote">``if things were done at all, they must be done properly'' (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did
not see how they were to live otherwise. If each head of household
expenditure had been mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) beforehand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have
probably observed that <div class="bookquote">``it could hardly come to much,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and if any one
had suggested a saving on a particular article--for example, the
substitution of cheap fish for dear--it would have appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
simply a penny-wise, mean notion. Rosamond, even without such an
occasion as Captain Lydgate's visit, was fond of giving invitations,
and Lydgate, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) often thought the guests tiresome, did not
interfere. This sociability seemed a necessary part of professional
prudence, and the entertainment must be suitable. It is true Lydgate
was constantly visiting the homes of the poor and adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
prescriptions of diet to their small means; but, dear me! has it not by
this time ceased to be remarkable--is it not rather that we expect in
men, that they should have numerous strands of experience lying side by
side and never compare them with each other? Expenditure--like
ugliness and errors--becomes a totally new thing when we attach our own
personality to it, and measure it by that wide difference which is
manifest -LRB-in our own sensations-RRB- between ourselves and others. Lydgate
believed himself to be careless about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dress, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) despised a man
who calculated the effects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) costume; it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) only a
matter of course that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had abundance of fresh garments--such things
were naturally ordered in sheaves. It must be remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
never hitherto felt the check of importunate debt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked by
habit, not by self-criticism. But the check had come.

<p/>Its novelty made it the more irritating. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was amazed, disgusted that
conditions so foreign to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) purposes, so hatefully disconnected
with the objects he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cared to occupy himself with, should have lain in
ambush and clutched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was unaware. And there was not only
the actual debt; there was the certainty that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) present position
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must go on deepening it. Two furnishing tradesmen at Brassing,
whose bills had been incurred before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) marriage, and whom
uncalculated current expenses had ever since prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from paying,
had repeatedly sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) unpleasant letters which had forced themselves
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) attention. This could hardly have been more galling to any
disposition than to Lydgate's, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intense pride--his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dislike of
asking a favor or being under an obligation to any one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had scorned
even to form conjectures about Mr. Vincy's intentions on money matters,
and nothing but extremity could have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) to apply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
father-in-law, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had not been made aware in various indirect
ways since his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) marriage that Mr. Vincy's own affairs were not
flourishing, and that the expectation of help from him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) would be
resented. Some men easily trust in the readiness of friends; it had
never in the former part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) life occurred to Lydgate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should
need to do so: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never thought what borrowing would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); but
now that the idea had entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would rather
incur any other hardship. In the mean time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no money or
prospects of money; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice was not getting more lucrative.

<p/>No wonder that Lydgate had been unable to suppress all signs of inward
trouble during the last few months, and now that Rosamond was regaining
brilliant health, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meditated taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) entirely into confidence on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) difficulties. New conversance with tradesmen's bills had forced
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reasoning into a new channel of comparison: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had begun to
consider from a new point of view what was necessary and unnecessary in
goods ordered, and to see that there must be some change of habits.
How could such a change be made without Rosamond's concurrence? The
immediate occasion of opening the disagreeable fact to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was forced
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/>Having no money, and having privately sought advice as to what security
could possibly be given by a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, Lydgate had offered
the one good security in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) power to the less peremptory creditor, who
was a silversmith and jeweller, and who consented to take on himself
the upholsterer's credit also, accepting interest for a given term.
The security necessary was a bill of sale on the furniture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
house, which might make a creditor easy for a reasonable time about a
debt amounting to less than four hundred pounds; and the silversmith,
Mr. Dover, was willing to reduce it by taking back a portion of the
plate and any other article which was as good as new. <div class="bookquote">``Any other
article''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>was a phrase delicately implying jewellery, and more
particularly some purple amethysts costing thirty pounds, which Lydgate
had bought as a bridal present.

<p/>Opinions may be divided as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wisdom in making this present: some
may think that it was a graceful attention to be expected from a man
like Lydgate, and that the fault of any troublesome consequences lay in
the pinched narrowness of provincial life at that time, which offered
no conveniences for professional people whose fortune was not
proportioned to their tastes; also, in Lydgate's ridiculous
fastidiousness about asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friends for money.

<p/>However, it had seemed a question of no moment to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) on that fine
morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went to give a final order for plate: in the presence
of other jewels enormously expensive, and as an addition to orders of
which the amount had not been exactly calculated, thirty pounds for
ornaments so exquisitely suited to Rosamond's neck and arms could
hardly appear excessive when there was no ready cash for it to exceed.
But at this crisis Lydgate's imagination could not help dwelling on the
possibility of letting the amethysts take their place again among Mr.
Dover's stock, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) shrank from the idea of proposing this to
Rosamond. Having been roused to discern consequences which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) had
never been in the habit of tracing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) was preparing to act on this
discernment with some of the rigor -LRB-by no means all-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) would have
applied in pursuing experiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) was nerving himself to this rigor
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) rode from Brassing, and meditated on the representations he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) must
make to Rosamond.

<p/>It was evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) got home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) was intensely miserable, this
strong man of nine-and-twenty and of many gifts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) was not saying
angrily within himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) had made a profound mistake; but the
mistake was at work in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) like a recognized chronic disease, mingling
its uneasy importunities with every prospect, and enfeebling every
thought. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) went along the passage to the drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dover</b></font>) heard
the piano and singing. Of course, Ladislaw was there. It was some
weeks since Will had parted from Dorothea, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was still at the old
post in Middlemarch. Lydgate had no objection in general to Ladislaw's
coming, but just now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was annoyed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not find his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hearth
free. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opened the door the two singers went on towards the
key-note, raising their eyes and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) indeed, but not
regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) entrance as an interruption. To a man galled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
harness as poor Lydgate was, it is not soothing to see two people
warbling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) comes in with the sense that the painful day has
still pains in store. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face, already paler than usual, took on a
scowl as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked across the room and flung himself into a chair.

<p/>The singers feeling themselves excused by the fact that they had only
three bars to sing, now turned round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Lydgate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, coming forward to shake hands.

<p/>Lydgate took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hand, but did not think it necessary to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you dined, Tertius? I expected you much earlier,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
who had already seen that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband was in a <div class="bookquote">``horrible humor.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
seated herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) usual place as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have dined. I should like some tea, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, curtly,
still scowling and looking markedly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) legs stretched out before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/>Will was too quick to need more. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be off,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, reaching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tea is coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond; <div class="bookquote">``pray don't go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Lydgate is bored,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, who had more comprehension of
Lydgate than Rosamond had, and was not offended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) manner, easily
imagining outdoor causes of annoyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is the more need for you to stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, playfully, and
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lightest accent; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will not speak to me all the evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Rosamond, I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) strong baritone. <div class="bookquote">``I
have some serious business to speak to you about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>No introduction of the business could have been less like that which
Lydgate had intended; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) indifferent manner had been too provoking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There! you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``I'm going to the meeting about the
Mechanics' Institute. Good-by;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went quickly out of the room.

<p/>Rosamond did not look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, but presently rose and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
place before the tea-tray. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
so disagreeable. Lydgate turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dark eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) delicately handled the tea-service with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) taper fingers, and
looked at the objects immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with no curve in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face
disturbed, and yet with an ineffable protest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) air against all
people with unpleasant manners. For the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lost the sense of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wound in a sudden speculation about this new form of feminine
impassibility revealing itself in the sylph-like frame which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
once interpreted as the sign of a ready intelligent sensitiveness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mind glancing back to Laure while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) looked at Rosamond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said
inwardly, <div class="bookquote">``Would _she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)_ kill me because I wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then, <div class="bookquote">``It is
the way with all women.''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>But this power of generalizing which gives men
so much the superiority in mistake over the dumb animals, was
immediately thwarted by Lydgate's memory of wondering impressions from
the behavior of another woman--from Dorothea's looks and tones of
emotion about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband when Lydgate began to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)--from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
passionate cry to be taught what would best comfort that man for whose
sake it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must quell every impulse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) except the
yearnings of faithfulness and compassion. These revived impressions
succeeded each other quickly and dreamily in Lydgate's mind while the
tea was being brewed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes in the last instant of
reverie while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heard Dorothea saying, <div class="bookquote">``Advise me--think what I can
do--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has been all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life laboring and looking forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) minds
about nothing else--and I mind about nothing else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>That voice of deep-souled womanhood had remained within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as the
enkindling conceptions of dead and sceptred genius had remained within
him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) -LRB-is there not a genius for feeling nobly which also reigns over
human spirits and their conclusions?-RRB-; the tones were a music from
which he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was falling away--he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) had really fallen into a momentary doze,
when Rosamond said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) silvery neutral way, <div class="bookquote">``Here is your tea,
Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>setting it on the small table by his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) side, and then moved
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) place without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>). Lydgate was too hasty in
attributing insensibility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); after her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own fashion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was
sensitive enough, and took lasting impressions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) impression now was
one of offence and repulsion. But then, Rosamond had no scowls and had
never raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) voice: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was quite sure that no one could justly
find fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/>Perhaps Lydgate and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had never felt so far off each other before;
but there were strong reasons for not deferring his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) revelation, even if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not already begun it by that abrupt announcement; indeed some of
the angry desire to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into more sensibility on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) account
which had prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to speak prematurely, still mingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
pain in the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pain. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) waited till the tray was
gone, the candles were lit, and the evening quiet might be counted on:
the interval had left time for repelled tenderness to return into the
old course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spoke kindly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Rosy, lay down your work and come to sit by me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, gently,
pushing away the table, and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm to draw a chair near
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own.

<p/>Rosamond obeyed. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) came towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) drapery of transparent
faintly tinted muslin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) slim yet round figure never looked more
graceful; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and laid one hand on the elbow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
chair, at last looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) delicate neck
and cheek and purely cut lips never had more of that untarnished beauty
which touches as in spring-time and infancy and all sweet freshness.
It touched Lydgate now, and mingled the early moments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with all the other memories which were stirred in this crisis of
deep trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ample hand softly on hers, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with the lingering utterance which affection gives to the word.
Rosamond too was still under the power of that same past, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
husband was still in part the Lydgate whose approval had stirred
delight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hair lightly away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) forehead, then laid
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) other hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and was conscious of forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to tell you what will hurt you, Rosy. But there are
things which husband and wife must think of together. I dare say it
has occurred to you already that I am short of money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate paused; but Rosamond turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) neck and looked at a vase on
the mantel-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not able to pay for all the things we had to get before we were
married, and there have been expenses since which I have been obliged
to meet. The consequence is, there is a large debt at Brassing--three
hundred and eighty pounds--which has been pressing on me a good while,
and in fact we are getting deeper every day, for people don't pay me
the faster because others want the money. I took pains to keep it from
you while you were not well; but now we must think together about it,
and you must help me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What can--I--do, Tertius?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
again. That little speech of four words, like so many others in all
languages, is capable by varied vocal inflections of expressing all
states of mind from helpless dimness to exhaustive argumentative
perception, from the completest self-devoting fellowship to the most
neutral aloofness. Rosamond's thin utterance threw into the words
<div class="bookquote">``What can--I--do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>as much neutrality as they could hold. They fell
like a mortal chill on Lydgate's roused tenderness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not storm
in indignation--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt too sad a sinking of the heart. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
spoke again it was more in the tone of a man who forces himself to
fulfil a task.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is necessary for you to know, because I have to give security for a
time, and a man must come to make an inventory of the furniture.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond colored deeply. <div class="bookquote">``Have you not asked papa for money?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
said, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I must ask him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands from Lydgate's,
and rising to stand at two yards' distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Rosy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``It is too late to do that. The
inventory will be begun to-morrow. Remember it is a mere security: it
will make no difference: it is a temporary affair. I insist upon it
that your father shall not know, unless I choose to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>added
Lydgate, with a more peremptory emphasis.

<p/>This certainly was unkind, but Rosamond had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) back on evil
expectation as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would do in the way of quiet steady
disobedience. The unkindness seemed unpardonable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was not
given to weeping and disliked it, but now her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chin and lips began to
tremble and the tears welled up. Perhaps it was not possible for
Lydgate, under the double stress of outward material difficulty and of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own proud resistance to humiliating consequences, to imagine fully
what this sudden trial was to a young creature who had known nothing
but indulgence, and whose dreams had all been of new indulgence, more
exactly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) taste. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did wish to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
could, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tears cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to the heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not speak again
immediately; but Rosamond did not go on sobbing: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tried to conquer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) agitation and wiped away her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tears, continuing to look before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
at the mantel-piece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Try not to grieve, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes up towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). That she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had chosen to move away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in this moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
trouble made everything harder to say, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must absolutely go on.
<div class="bookquote">``We must brace ourselves to do what is necessary. It is I who have
been in fault: I ought to have seen that I could not afford to live in
this way. But many things have told against me in my practice, and it
really just now has ebbed to a low point. I may recover it, but in the
mean time we must pull up--we must change our way of living. We shall
weather it. When I have given this security I shall have time to look
about me; and you are so clever that if you turn your mind to managing
you will school me into carefulness. I have been a thoughtless rascal
about squaring prices--but come, dear, sit down and forgive me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) neck under the yoke like a creature who had
talons, but who had Reason too, which often reduces us to meekness.
When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had spoken the last words in an imploring tone, Rosamond
returned to the chair by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) self-blame gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) some hope
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) opinion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why can you not put off having the inventory made? You can send the
men away to-morrow when they come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not send them away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, the peremptoriness rising
again. Was it of any use to explain?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we left Middlemarch? there would of course be a sale, and that
would do as well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we are not going to leave Middlemarch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure, Tertius, it would be much better to do so. Why can we not
go to London? Or near Durham, where your family is known?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can go nowhere without money, Rosamond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your friends would not wish you to be without money. And surely these
odious tradesmen might be made to understand that, and to wait, if you
would make proper representations to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is idle Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``You must learn to
take my judgment on questions you don't understand. I have made
necessary arrangements, and they must be carried out. As to friends, I
have no expectations whatever from them, and shall not ask them for
anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond sat perfectly still. The thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind was that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had known how Lydgate would behave, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would never have married him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have no time to waste now on unnecessary words, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate, trying to be gentle again. <div class="bookquote">``There are some details that I
want to consider with you. Dover says he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) will take a good deal of the
plate back again, and any of the jewellery we like. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) really behaves
very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are we to go without spoons and forks then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, whose very
lips seemed to get thinner with the thinness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) utterance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was
determined to make no further resistance or suggestions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``But look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) continued, drawing a
paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pocket and opening it; <div class="bookquote">``here is Dover's account. See, I
have marked a number of articles, which if we returned them would
reduce the amount by thirty pounds and more. I have not marked any
of the jewellery.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lydgate had really felt this point of the jewellery
very bitter to himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had overcome the feeling by severe
argument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not propose to Rosamond that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should return any
particular present of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was bound to
put Dover's offer before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) inward prompting might make the
affair easy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is useless for me to look, Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, calmly; <div class="bookquote">``you
will return what you please.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) eyes on the
paper, and Lydgate, flushing up to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hair, drew it back
and let it fall on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knee. Meanwhile Rosamond quietly went out of
the room, leaving Lydgate helpless and wondering. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) not coming
back? It seemed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had no more identified herself with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) than
if they had been creatures of different species and opposing interests.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands deep into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pockets with a
sort of vengeance. There was still science--there were still good
objects to work for. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must give a tug still--all the stronger
because other satisfactions were going.

<p/>But the door opened and Rosamond re-entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) carried the leather
box containing the amethysts, and a tiny ornamental basket which
contained other boxes, and laying them on the chair where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been
sitting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, with perfect propriety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) air--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is all the jewellery you ever gave me. You can return what you
like of it, and of the plate also. You will not, of course, expect me
to stay at home to-morrow. I shall go to papa's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To many women the look Lydgate cast at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have been more
terrible than one of anger: it had in it a despairing acceptance of the
distance she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was placing between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And when shall you come back again?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, with a bitter edge on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) accent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, in the evening. Of course I shall not mention the subject to
mamma.''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Rosamond was convinced that no woman could behave more
irreproachably than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was behaving; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went to sit down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
work-table. Lydgate sat meditating a minute or two, and the result was
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, with some of the old emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now we have been united, Rosy, you should not leave me to myself in
the first trouble that has come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond; <div class="bookquote">``I shall do everything it becomes me to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not right that the thing should be left to servants, or that I
should have to speak to them about it. And I shall be obliged to go
out--I don't know how early. I understand your shrinking from the
humiliation of these money affairs. But, my dear Rosamond, as a
question of pride, which I feel just as much as you can, it is surely
better to manage the thing ourselves, and let the servants see as
little of it as possible; and since you are my wife, there is no
hindering your share in my disgraces--if there were disgraces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond did not answer immediately, but at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well,
I will stay at home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not touch these jewels, Rosy. Take them away again. But I
will write out a list of plate that we may return, and that can be
packed up and sent at once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The servants will know _that_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with the slightest
touch of sarcasm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we must meet some disagreeables as necessities. Where is the
ink, I wonder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, rising, and throwing the account on the
larger table where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant to write.

<p/>Rosamond went to reach the inkstand, and after setting it on the table
was going to turn away, when Lydgate, who was standing close by, put
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, darling, let us make the best of things. It will only be for a
time, I hope, that we shall have to be stingy and particular. Kiss me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) native warm-heartedness took a great deal of quenching, and it is a
part of manliness for a husband to feel keenly the fact that an
inexperienced girl has got into trouble by marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) received
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kiss and returned it faintly, and in this way an appearance of
accord was recovered for the time. But Lydgate could not help looking
forward with dread to the inevitable future discussions about
expenditure and the necessity for a complete change in their way of
living.



<p/>CHAPTER LIX.

<p/>They said of old the Soul had human shape,
But smaller, subtler than the fleshly self,
So wandered forth for airing when it pleased.
And see! beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cherub-face there floats
A pale-lipped form aerial whispering
Its promptings in that little shell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear.''


<p/>News is often dispersed as thoughtlessly and effectively as that pollen
which the bees carry off -LRB-having no idea how powdery they are-RRB- when
they are buzzing in search of their particular nectar. This fine
comparison has reference to Fred Vincy, who on that evening at Lowick
Parsonage heard a lively discussion among the ladies on the news which
their old servant had got from Tantripp concerning Mr. Casaubon's
strange mention of Mr. Ladislaw in a codicil to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) will made not long
before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) death. Miss Winifred was astounded to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Winifred</b></font>) brother
had known the fact before, and observed that Camden was the most
wonderful man for knowing things and not telling them; whereupon Mary
Garth said that the codicil had perhaps got mixed up with the habits of
spiders, which Miss Winifred never would listen to. Mrs. Farebrother
considered that the news had something to do with their having only
once seen Mr. Ladislaw at Lowick, and Miss Noble made many small
compassionate mewings.

<p/>Fred knew little and cared less about Ladislaw and the Casaubons, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mind never recurred to that discussion till one day calling on
Rosamond at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mother's request to deliver a message as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
happened to see Ladislaw going away. Fred and Rosamond had little to
say to each other now that marriage had removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from collision with
the unpleasantness of brothers, and especially now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had taken
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) held the stupid and even reprehensible step of giving up the
Church to take to such a business as Mr. Garth's. Hence Fred talked by
preference of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) considered indifferent news, and <div class="bookquote">``a propos of
that young Ladislaw''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>mentioned what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had heard at Lowick Parsonage.

<p/>Now Lydgate, like Mr. Farebrother, knew a great deal more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) told,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had once been set thinking about the relation between Will
and Dorothea his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) conjectures had gone beyond the fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) imagined
that there was a passionate attachment on both sides, and this struck
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as much too serious to gossip about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) remembered Will's
irritability when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had mentioned Mrs. Casaubon, and was the more
circumspect. On the whole his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) surmises, in addition to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew of
the fact, increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friendliness and tolerance towards Ladislaw,
and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) understand the vacillation which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at Middlemarch
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should go away. It was significant of the
separateness between Lydgate's mind and Rosamond's that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no
impulse to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) on the subject; indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not quite trust
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) reticence towards Will. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was right there; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no
vision of the way in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind would act in urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to speak.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) repeated Fred's news to Lydgate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Take care you don't
drop the faintest hint to Ladislaw, Rosy. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is likely to fly out as
if you insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Of course it is a painful affair.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) neck and patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hair, looking the image of
placid indifference. But the next time Will came when Lydgate was
away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke archly about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not going to London as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
threatened.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know all about it. I have a confidential little bird,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>),
showing very pretty airs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head over the bit of work held high
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) active fingers. <div class="bookquote">``There is a powerful magnet in this
neighborhood.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure there is. Nobody knows that better than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will,
with light gallantry, but inwardly prepared to be angry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is really the most charming romance: Mr. Casaubon jealous, and
foreseeing that there was no one else whom Mrs. Casaubon would so much
like to marry, and no one who would so much like to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) as a
certain gentleman; and then laying a plan to spoil all by making her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
forfeit her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) property if she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did marry that gentleman--and then--and
then--and then--oh, I have no doubt the end will be thoroughly
romantic.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Great God! what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, flushing over face and ears,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) features seeming to change as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had had a violent shake.
<div class="bookquote">``Don't joke; tell me what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't really know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, no longer playful, and desiring
nothing better than to tell in order that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) might evoke effects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) returned, impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know that Mr. Casaubon has left it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) will that if Mrs.
Casaubon marries you she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is to forfeit all her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) property?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that it is true?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, eagerly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother Fred heard it from the Farebrothers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will started up from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) chair and reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) likes you better than the property,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) from a distance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't say any more about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, in a hoarse undertone
extremely unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) usual light voice. <div class="bookquote">``It is a foul insult to her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
and to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) sat down absently, looking before him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), but seeing
nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you are angry with _me_,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``It is too bad to bear
_me_ malice. You ought to be obliged to me for telling you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, abruptly, speaking with that kind of double soul
which belongs to dreamers who answer questions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I expect to hear of the marriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, playfully.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never! You will never hear of the marriage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>With those words uttered impetuously, Will rose, put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hand to
Rosamond, still with the air of a somnambulist, and went away.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was gone, Rosamond left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chair and walked to the other end
of the room, leaning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) got there against a chiffonniere, and
looking out of the window wearily. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was oppressed by ennui, and by
that dissatisfaction which in women's minds is continually turning into
a trivial jealousy, referring to no real claims, springing from no
deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism, and yet capable
of impelling action as well as speech. <div class="bookquote">``There really is nothing to
care for much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said poor Rosamond inwardly, thinking of the family at
Quallingham, who did not write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); and that perhaps Tertius when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
came home would tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) about expenses. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had already secretly
disobeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father to help them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had ended
decisively by saying, <div class="bookquote">``I am more likely to want help myself.''



 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LX.

<p/>Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable.
--Justice Shallow.


<p/>A few days afterwards--it was already the end of August--there was an
occasion which caused some excitement in Middlemarch: the public, if it
chose, was to have the advantage of buying, under the distinguished
auspices of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, the furniture, books, and pictures
which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind,
belonging to Edwin Larcher, Esq.. This was not one of the sales
indicating the depression of trade; on the contrary, it was due to Mr.
Larcher's great success in the carrying business, which warranted his (<font color='blue'><b>Larcher</b></font>)
purchase of a mansion near Riverston already furnished in high style by
an illustrious Spa physician--furnished indeed with such large
framefuls of expensive flesh-painting in the dining-room, that Mrs.
Larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be
Scriptural. Hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well
pointed out in the handbills of Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, whose
acquaintance with the history of art enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to state that the hall
furniture, to be sold without reserve, comprised a piece of carving by
a contemporary of Gibbons.

<p/>At Middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of
festival. There was a table spread with the best cold eatables, as at
a superior funeral; and facilities were offered for that
generous-drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and
cheerful bidding for undesirable articles. Mr. Larcher's sale was the
more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the
end of the town, with a garden and stables attached, in that pleasant
issue from Middlemarch called the London Road, which was also the road
to the New Hospital and to Mr. Bulstrode's retired residence, known as
the Shrubs. In short, the auction was as good as a fair, and drew all
classes with leisure at command: to some, who risked making bids in
order simply to raise prices, it was almost equal to betting at the
races. The second day, when the best furniture was to be sold,
<div class="bookquote">``everybody''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thesiger</b></font>)</div>was there; even Mr. Thesiger, the rector of St. Peter's,
had looked in for a short time, wishing to buy the carved table, and
had rubbed elbows with Mr. Bambridge and Mr. Horrock. There was a
wreath of Middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large
table in the dining-room, where Mr. Borthrop Trumbull was mounted with
desk and hammer; but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were
often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the
large bow-window opening on to the lawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>that day did not include Mr. Bulstrode, whose health could
not well endure crowds and draughts. But Mrs. Bulstrode had
particularly wished to have a certain picture--a <div class="bookquote">``Supper at Emmaus,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>attributed in the catalogue to Guido; and at the last moment before the
day of the sale Mr. Bulstrode had called at the office of the
<div class="bookquote">``Pioneer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was now one of the proprietors, to beg of Mr.
Ladislaw as a great favor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would obligingly use his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) remarkable
knowledge of pictures on behalf of Mrs. Bulstrode, and judge of the
value of this particular painting--<div class="bookquote">``if,''  (<font color='red'><b>judge</b></font>)</div>added the scrupulously polite
banker, <div class="bookquote">``attendance at the sale would not interfere with the
arrangements for your departure, which I know is imminent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div><p/>This proviso might have sounded rather satirically in Will's ear if he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
had been in a mood to care about such satire. It referred to an
understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of
the paper, that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) should be at liberty any day he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) pleased to hand over
the management to the subeditor whom he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had been training; since he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
wished finally to quit Middlemarch. But indefinite visions of ambition
are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly
agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve
when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary. In such
states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning
towards miracle: impossible to conceive how our wish could be
fulfilled, still--very wonderful things have happened! Will did not
confess this weakness to himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) lingered. What was the use of
going to London at that time of the year? The Rugby men who would
remember him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) were not there; and so far as political writing was
concerned, he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) would rather for a few weeks go on with the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At the present moment, however, when Mr. Bulstrode was speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve
not to go till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had once more seen Dorothea. Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) replied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had reasons for deferring his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) departure a little, and would be happy
to go to the sale.

<p/>Will was in a defiant mood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) consciousness being deeply stung with
the thought that the people who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) probably knew a fact
tantamount to an accusation against him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) as a fellow with low designs
which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property. Like most
people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional
distinction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any
one who might hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had personal reasons for that assertion--that
there was anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) blood, his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) bearing, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) character to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) gave the mask of an opinion. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was under an irritating
impression of this kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would go about for days with a defiant look,
the color changing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) transparent skin as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) were on the qui
vive, watching for something which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had to dart upon.

<p/>This expression was peculiarly noticeable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) at the sale, and those
who had only seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) moods of gentle oddity or of bright
enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was not sorry to
have this occasion for appearing in public before the Middlemarch
tribes of Toller, Hackbutt, and the rest, who looked down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) as an
adventurer, and were in a state of brutal ignorance about Dante--who
sneered at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) Polish blood, and were themselves of a breed very much
in need of crossing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) stood in a conspicuous place not far from the
auctioneer, with a fore-finger in each side-pocket and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) head thrown
backward, not caring to speak to anybody, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) had been cordially
welcomed as a connoiss_ure_ by Mr. Trumbull, who was enjoying the
utmost activity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) great faculties.

<p/>And surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their
powers of speech, the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer
keenly alive to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) own jokes and sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) encyclopedic
knowledge. Some saturnine, sour-blooded persons might object to be
constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot-jacks to
<div class="bookquote">``Berghems;''  (<font color='red'><b>Some persons</b></font>)</div>but Mr. Borthrop Trumbull had a kindly liquid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) veins;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was an admirer by nature, and would have liked to have the universe
under his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) hammer, feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
recommendation.

<p/>Meanwhile Mrs. Larcher's drawing-room furniture was enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>).
When Will Ladislaw had come in, a second fender, said to have been
forgotten in its right place, suddenly claimed the auctioneer's
enthusiasm, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) distributed on the equitable principle of praising
those things most which were most in need of praise. The fender was of
polished steel, with much lancet-shaped open-work and a sharp edge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall appeal to you. Here is a fender which
at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve, being, as I
may say, for quality of steel and quaintness of design, a kind of
thing'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--here Mr. Trumbull dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) voice and became slightly nasal,
trimming his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) outlines with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) left finger--<div class="bookquote">``that might not fall in
with ordinary tastes. Allow me to tell you that by-and-by this style
of workmanship will be the only one in vogue--half-a-crown, you said?
thank you--going at half-a-crown, this characteristic fender; and I
have particular information that the antique style is very much sought
after in high quarters. Three shillings--three-and-sixpence--hold it
well up, Joseph! Look, ladies, at the chastity of the design--I have
no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century! Four
shillings, Mr. Mawmsey?--four shillings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not a thing I would put in _my_ drawing-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Mawmsey</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Mawmsey,
audibly, for the warning of the rash husband. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder _at_ Mrs.
Larcher. Every blessed child's head that fell against it would be cut
in two. The edge is like a knife.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Trumbull, quickly, <div class="bookquote">``and most uncommonly
useful to have a fender at hand that will cut, if you have a leather
shoe-tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand:
many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
down. Gentlemen, here's a fender that if you had the misfortune to
hang yourselves would cut you down in no time--with astonishing
celerity--four-and-sixpence--five--five-and-sixpence--an appropriate
thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four-poster and a guest a
little out of his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) mind--six shillings--thank you, Mr. Clintup--going
at six shillings--going--gone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>The auctioneer's glance, which had
been searching round him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) with a preternatural susceptibility to all
signs of bidding, here dropped on the paper before him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) voice
too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Clintup. Be handy, Joseph.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that
joke on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Clintup</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Clintup, laughing low and apologetically to his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintup</b></font>) next
neighbor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clintup</b></font>) was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman, and
feared that the audience might regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Clintup</b></font>) bid as a foolish one.

<p/>Meanwhile Joseph had brought a trayful of small articles. <div class="bookquote">``Now,
ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, taking up one of the articles, <div class="bookquote">``this tray
contains a very recherchy lot--a collection of trifles for the
drawing-room table--and trifles make the sum _of_ human things--nothing
more important than trifles---LRB-yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes, by-and-by-RRB---but
pass the tray round, Joseph--these bijoux must be examined, ladies.
This I have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance--a sort of
practical rebus, I may call it: here, you see, it looks like an elegant
heart-shaped box, portable--for the pocket; there, again, it becomes
like a splendid double flower--an ornament for the table; and now'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>--Mr.
Trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of
heart-shaped leaves--``a book of riddles! No less than five hundred
printed in a beautiful red. Gentlemen, if I had less of a conscience,
I should not wish you to bid high for this lot--I have a longing for
it myself. What can promote innocent mirth, and I may say virtue, more
than a good riddle?--it hinders profane language, and attaches a man to
the society of refined females. This ingenious article itself, without
the elegant domino-box, card-basket, &c., ought alone to give a high
price to the lot. Carried in the pocket it might make an individual
welcome in any society. Four shillings, sir?--four shillings for this
remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras. Here is a
sample: ``How must you spell honey to make it catch lady-birds?
Answer--money.<div class="bookquote">'' You hear?--lady-birds--honey money. This is an
amusement to sharpen the intellect; it has a sting--it has what we call
satire, and wit without indecency. Four-and-sixpence--five shillings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The bidding ran on with warming rivalry. Mr. Bowyer was a bidder, and
this was too exasperating. Bowyer couldn't afford it, and only wanted
to hinder every other man from making a figure. The current carried
even Mr. Horrock with it, but this committal of himself to an opinion
fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) with so little sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) neutral expression, that
the bid might not have been detected as his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) but for the friendly oaths
of Mr. Bambridge, who wanted to know what Horrock would do with blasted
stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition
which the horse-dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of
earthly existences. The lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to
Mr. Spilkins, a young Slender of the neighborhood, who was reckless
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pocket-money and felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) want of memory for riddles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Trumbull, this is too bad--you've been putting some old maid's
rubbish into the sale,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>murmured Mr. Toller, getting close to the
auctioneer. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see how the prints go, and I must be off soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">''_Im_mediately, Mr. Toller. It was only an act of benevolence which
your noble heart would approve. Joseph! quick with the prints--Lot
235. Now, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have
a treat. Here is an engraving of the Duke of Wellington surrounded by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) staff on the Field of Waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events
which have, as it were, enveloped our great Hero in a cloud, I will be
bold to say--for a man in my line must not be blown about by political
winds--that a finer subject--of the modern order, belonging to our own
time and epoch--the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels
might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who painted it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Powderell</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Powderell, much impressed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a proof before the letter, Mr. Powderell--the painter is not
known,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>answered Trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) last
words, after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) pursed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) lips and stared round him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll bid a pound!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Powderell</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion,
as of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or
pity, nobody raised the price on him (<font color='blue'><b>Powderell</b></font>).

<p/>Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller had been eager for, and
after he (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) had secured them he (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) went away. Other prints, and afterwards
some paintings, were sold to leading Middlemarchers who had come with a
special desire for them, and there was a more active movement of the
audience in and out; some, who had bought what they wanted, going away,
others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the
refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn. It was
this marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) appeared to
like looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession.
On the last occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) return from it he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) was observed to bring
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one
else, whose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) might
be a relative of the horse-dealer's--also <div class="bookquote">``given to indulgence.''  (<font color='red'><b>the horse-dealer</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
large whiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) a
striking figure; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) suit of black, rather shabby at the edges,
caused the prejudicial inference that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was not able to afford himself
as much indulgence as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) liked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is it you've picked up, Bam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Horrock/Mr. Horrock</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Horrock, aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bambridge. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>)'d just turned
in from the road.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Horrock/Mr. Horrock</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Horrock eyed the stranger, who was leaning back against his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) stick
with one hand, using his (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) toothpick with the other, and looking about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on
him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) by circumstances.

<p/>At length the <div class="bookquote">``Supper at Emmaus''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>was brought forward, to Will's immense
relief, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was getting so tired of the proceedings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had
drawn back a little and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) shoulder against the wall just
behind the auctioneer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) now came forward again, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) eye caught
the conspicuous stranger, who, rather to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) surprise, was staring at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) markedly. But Will was immediately appealed to by Mr. Trumbull.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mr. Ladislaw, yes; this interests you as a connoiss_ure_, I
think. It is some pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>the auctioneer went on with a rising
fervor, <div class="bookquote">``to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and
gentlemen--a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on
a level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) judgment. It is a painting of the Italian school--by
the celebrated Guydo, the greatest painter in the world, the chief of
the Old Masters, as they are called--I take it, because they were up
to a thing or two beyond most of us--in possession of secrets now lost
to the bulk of mankind. Let me tell you, gentlemen, I have seen a
great many pictures by the Old Masters, and they are not all up to this
mark--some of them are darker than you might like and not family
subjects. But here is a Guydo--the frame alone is worth pounds--which
any lady might be proud to hang up--a suitable thing for what we call a
refectory in a charitable institution, if any gentleman of the
Corporation wished to show his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) munifi_cence_. Turn it a little, sir?
yes. Joseph, turn it a little towards Mr. Ladislaw--Mr. Ladislaw,
having been abroad, understands the merit of these things, you observe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div><p/>All eyes were for a moment turned towards Will, who said, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``Five
pounds.''  (<font color='red'><b>auctioneer</b></font>)</div>The auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance.

<p/>``Ah! Mr. Ladislaw! the frame alone is worth that. Ladies and
gentlemen, for the credit of the town! Suppose it should be discovered
hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town, and
nobody in Middlemarch awake to it. Five guineas--five seven-six--five
ten. Still, ladies, still! It is a gem, and ``Full many a gem,<div class="bookquote">'' as the
poet says, has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public
knew no better, because it was offered in circles where there was--I
was going to say a low feeling, but no!--Six pounds--six guineas--a
Guydo of the first order going at six guineas--it is an insult to
religion, ladies; it touches us all as Christians, gentlemen, that a
subject like this should go at such a low figure--six pounds
ten--seven--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>The bidding was brisk, and Will continued to share in it, remembering
that Mrs. Bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture, and thinking
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) might stretch the price to twelve pounds. But it was knocked
down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) at ten guineas, whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) way towards the
bow-window and went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) chose to go under the marquee to get a
glass of water, being hot and thirsty: it was empty of other visitors,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) asked the woman in attendance to fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) some fresh water; but
before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was well gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was annoyed to see entering the florid
stranger who had stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). It struck Will at this moment that the
man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated
kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as having
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) speak on the Reform question, and who might think of getting
a shilling by news. In this light his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) person, already rather heating
to behold on a summer's day, appeared the more disagreeable; and Will,
half-seated on the elbow of a garden-chair, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eyes carefully
away from the comer. But this signified little to our acquaintance Mr.
Raffles, who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling
observation, if it suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) purpose to do so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) moved a step or two
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was in front of Will, and said with full-mouthed haste, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse
me, Mr. Ladislaw--was your mother's name Sarah Dunkirk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will, starting to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) feet, moved backward a step, frowning, and saying
with some fierceness, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, it was. And what is that to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was in Will's nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct
answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences. To have
said, <div class="bookquote">``What is that to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the first instance, would have seemed
like shuffling--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) minded who knew anything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) origin!

<p/>Raffles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) side had not the same eagerness for a collision which
was implied in Ladislaw's threatening air. The slim young fellow with
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) girl's complexion looked like a tiger-cat ready to spring on him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
Under such circumstances Mr. Raffles's pleasure in annoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) company
was kept in abeyance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No offence, my good sir, no offence! I only remember your mother--knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a girl. But it is your father that you feature,
sir. I had the pleasure of seeing your father too. Parents alive, Mr.
Ladislaw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thundered Will, in the same attitude as before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Should be glad to do you a service, Mr. Ladislaw--by Jove, I should!
Hope to meet again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hereupon Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Hereupon Raffles, who had lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) hat with the last words, turned
himself round with a swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) leg and walked away. Will looked
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) a moment, and could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) did not re-enter the
auction-room, but appeared to be walking towards the road. For an
instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had been foolish not to let the man go on
talking;--but no! on the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preferred doing without knowledge
from that source.

<p/>Later in the evening, however, Raffles overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) in the street, and
appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) former
reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity, greeted
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) jovially and walked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) side, remarking at first on the
pleasantness of the town and neighborhood. Will suspected that the man
had been drinking and was considering how to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off when Raffles
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been abroad myself, Mr. Ladislaw--I've seen the world--used to
parley-vous a little. It was at Boulogne I saw your father--a most
uncommon likeness you are of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), by Jove! mouth--nose--eyes--hair
turned off your brow just like his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--a little in the foreign style.
John Bull doesn't do much of that. But your father was very ill when I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Lord, lord! hands you might see through. You were a small
youngster then. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) get well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, curtly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Well! I've often wondered what became of your mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ran
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a young lass--a proud-spirited
lass, and pretty, by Jove! I knew the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ran away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>said
Raffles, winking slowly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) looked sideways at Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing dishonorable of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Will, turning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
rather savagely. But Mr. Raffles just now was not sensitive to shades
of manner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) head decisively <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a little too
honorable to like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends--that was it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here Raffles again winked
slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, I knew all about 'em--a little in what you
may call the respectable thieving line--the high style of
receiving-house--none of your holes and corners--first-rate. Slap-up
shop, high profits and no mistake. But Lord! Sarah would have known
nothing about it--a dashing young lady she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was--fine
boarding-school--fit for a lord's wife--only Archie Duncan threw it at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) out of spite, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) would have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Duncan</b></font>). And
so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) ran away from the whole concern. I travelled for 'em, sir, in a
gentlemanly way--at a high salary. They didn't mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) running away
at first--godly folks, sir, very godly--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was for the stage. The
son was alive then, and the daughter was at a discount. Hallo! here we
are at the Blue Bull. What do you say, Mr. Ladislaw?--shall we turn in
and have a glass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I must say good evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, dashing up a passage which
led into Lowick Gate, and almost running to get out of Raffles's reach.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) walked a long while on the Lowick road away from the town, glad of
the starlit darkness when it came. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had had dirt cast
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) amidst shouts of scorn. There was this to confirm the fellow's
statement--that his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother never would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
run away from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) family.

<p/>Well! what was he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Will Ladislaw, the worse, supposing the truth about
that family to be the ugliest? His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mother had braved hardship in order
to separate herself from it. But if Dorothea's friends had known this
story--if the Chettams had known it--they would have had a fine color
to give their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) unfit to
come near her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). However, let them suspect what they pleased, they would
find themselves in the wrong. They would find out that the blood in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) veins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs.



<p/>CHAPTER LXI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Inconsistencies,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered Imlac, <div class="bookquote">``cannot both be right,
but imputed to man they may both be true.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Rasselas.


<p/>The same night, when Mr. Bulstrode returned from a journey to Brassing
on business, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) good wife met him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in the entrance-hall and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) private sitting-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nicholas,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) honest eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``there
has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you--it has made me
quite uncomfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of man, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, dreadfully certain of
the answer.

<p/>``A red-faced man with large whiskers, and most impudent in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an old friend of yours, and said you would be sorry
not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to wait for you here, but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could see you at the Bank to-morrow morning. Most impudent he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
was!--stared at me, and said his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend Nick had luck in wives. I
don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) would have gone away, if Blucher had not happened to
break his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) chain and come running round on the gravel--for I was in the
garden; so I said, ``You'd better go away--the dog is very fierce, and I
can't hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">'' Do you really know anything of such a man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe I know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) is, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) usual
subdued voice, <div class="bookquote">``an unfortunate dissolute wretch, whom I helped too much
in days gone by. However, I presume you will not be troubled by him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>)
again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) will probably come to the Bank--to beg, doubtless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>No more was said on the subject until the next day, when Mr. Bulstrode
had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife, not
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was come home, looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) dressing-room and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) coat and cravat off, leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and
staring absently at the ground. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) started nervously and looked up as
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You look very ill, Nicholas. Is there anything the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have a good deal of pain in my head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, who was so
frequently ailing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife was always ready to believe in this
cause of depression.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Physically Mr. Bulstrode did not want the vinegar, but morally the
affectionate attention soothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). Though always polite, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
habit to receive such services with marital coolness, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife's
duty. But to-day, while she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You are
very good, Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a tone which had something new in it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
ear; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did not know exactly what the novelty was, but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) woman's
solicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) might be going
to have an illness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has anything worried you?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Did that man come to you at the
Bank?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; it was as I had supposed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man who at one time might have
done better. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sunk into a drunken debauched creature.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite gone away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, anxiously but for certain
reasons she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) refrained from adding, <div class="bookquote">``It was very disagreeable to hear
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) calling himself a friend of yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would not
have liked to say anything which implied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) habitual consciousness
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's earlier connections were not quite on a level with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knew much about them. That her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband had at
first been employed in a bank, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had afterwards entered into what
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called city business and gained a fortune before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was
three-and-thirty, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had married a widow who was much older than
himself--a Dissenter, and in other ways probably of that
disadvantageous quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired
into with the dispassionate judgment of a second--was almost as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had cared to learn beyond the glimpses which Mr. Bulstrode's
narrative occasionally gave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) early bent towards religion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
inclination to be a preacher, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) association with missionary and
philanthropic efforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) as an excellent man whose
piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman, whose
influence had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own mind toward seriousness, and whose share
of perishable good had been the means of raising her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own position. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) also liked to think that it was well in every sense for Mr.
Bulstrode to have won the hand of Harriet Vincy; whose family was
undeniable in a Middlemarch light--a better light surely than any
thrown in London thoroughfares or dissenting chapel-yards. The
unreformed provincial mind distrusted London; and while true religion
was everywhere saving, honest Mrs. Bulstrode was convinced that to be
saved in the Church was more respectable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) so much wished to ignore
towards others that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband had ever been a London Dissenter, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) liked to keep it out of sight even in talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) was quite
aware of this; indeed in some respects he (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) was rather afraid of this
ingenuous wife, whose imitative piety and native worldliness were
equally sincere, who had nothing to be ashamed of, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) had
married out of a thorough inclination still subsisting. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) fears
were such as belong to a man who cares to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) recognized
supremacy: the loss of high consideration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) wife, as from every
one else who did not clearly hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) out of enmity to the truth, would
be as the beginning of death to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>). When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite gone away?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I trust so,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) answered, with an effort to throw as much sober
unconcern into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dissenter</b></font>) tone as possible!

<p/>But in truth Mr. Bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust.
In the interview at the Bank, Raffles had made it evident that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) as any other greed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had frankly said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had turned out of the way to come to
Middlemarch, just to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) and see whether the neighborhood
would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to live in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had certainly had a few debts to pay
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) expected, but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet: a
cool five-and-twenty would suffice him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to go away with for the present.
What he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had wanted chiefly was to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) friend Nick and family, and
know all about the prosperity of a man to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so much attached.
By-and-by he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might come back for a longer stay. This time Raffles
declined to be <div class="bookquote">``seen off the premises,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) expressed it--declined to
quit Middlemarch under Bulstrode's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) meant to go by coach the
next day--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) chose.

<p/>Bulstrode felt himself helpless. Neither threats nor coaxing could
avail: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise.
On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt a cold certainty at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) heart that
Raffles--unless providence sent death to hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)--would come back
to Middlemarch before long. And that certainty was a terror.

<p/>It was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was in danger of legal punishment or of beggary: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
was in danger only of seeing disclosed to the judgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) neighbors
and the mournful perception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife certain facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) past life
which would render him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) an object of scorn and an opprobrium of the
religion with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had diligently associated himself. The terror
of being judged sharpens the memory: it sends an inevitable glare over
that long-unvisited past which has been habitually recalled only in
general phrases. Even without memory, the life is bound into one by a
zone of dependence in growth and decay; but intense memory forces a man
to own his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blameworthy past. With memory set smarting like a reopened
wound, a man's past is not simply a dead history, an outworn
preparation of the present: it is not a repented error shaken loose
from the life: it is a still quivering part of himself, bringing
shudders and bitter flavors and the tinglings of a merited shame.

<p/>Into this second life Bulstrode's past had now risen, only the
pleasures of it seeming to have lost their quality. Night and day,
without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and
fear into a fantastic present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt the scenes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) earlier life
coming between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) and everything else, as obstinately as when we look
through the window from a lighted room, the objects we turn our backs
on are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees. The
successive events inward and outward were there in one view: though
each might be dwelt on in turn, the rest still kept their hold in the
consciousness.

<p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) saw himself the young banker's clerk, with an agreeable
person, as clever in figures as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was fluent in speech and fond of
theological definition: an eminent though young member of a Calvinistic
dissenting church at Highbury, having had striking experience in
conviction of sin and sense of pardon. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) heard himself called
for as Brother Bulstrode in prayer meetings, speaking on religious
platforms, preaching in private houses. Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt himself thinking
of the ministry as possibly his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) vocation, and inclined towards
missionary labor. That was the happiest time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life: that was the
spot he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would have chosen now to awake in and find the rest a dream.
The people among whom Brother Bulstrode was distinguished were very
few, but they were very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) satisfaction the
more; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) power stretched through a narrow space, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt its
effect the more intensely. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) believed without effort in the peculiar
work of grace within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and in the signs that God intended him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for
special instrumentality.

<p/>Then came the moment of transition; it was with the sense of promotion
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), an orphan educated at a commercial charity-school, was
invited to a fine villa belonging to Mr. Dunkirk, the richest man in
the congregation. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) became an intimate there, honored for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>)
piety by the wife, marked out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) ability by the husband, whose
wealth was due to a flourishing city and west-end trade. That was the
setting-in of a new current for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) ambition, directing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) prospects
of <div class="bookquote">``instrumentality''  (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div>towards the uniting of distinguished religious
gifts with successful business.

<p/>By-and-by came a decided external leading: a confidential subordinate
partner died, and nobody seemed to the principal so well fitted to fill
the severely felt vacancy as his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) young friend Bulstrode, if he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) would
become confidential accountant. The offer was accepted. The business
was a pawnbroker's, of the most magnificent sort both in extent and
profits; and on a short acquaintance with it Bulstrode became aware
that one source of magnificent profit was the easy reception of any
goods offered, without strict inquiry as to where they came from. But
there was a branch house at the west end, and no pettiness or dinginess
to give suggestions of shame.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) first moments of shrinking. They were private, and
were filled with arguments; some of these taking the form of prayer.
The business was established and had old roots; is it not one thing to
set up a new gin-palace and another to accept an investment in an old
one? The profits made out of lost souls--where can the line be drawn
at which they begin in human transactions? Was it not even God's way
of saving His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chosen? <div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest,'' (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>--the young Bulstrode had said
then, as the older Bulstrode was saying now--<div class="bookquote">``Thou knowest how loose
my soul sits from these things--how I view them all as implements for
tilling Thy garden rescued here and there from the wilderness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Metaphors and precedents were not wanting; peculiar spiritual
experiences were not wanting which at last made the retention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
position seem a service demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>): the vista of a fortune had
already opened itself, and Bulstrode's shrinking remained private. Mr.
Dunkirk had never expected that there would be any shrinking at all: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>)
had never conceived that trade had anything to do with the scheme of
salvation. And it was true that Bulstrode found himself carrying on
two distinct lives; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) religious activity could not be incompatible
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) business as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had argued himself into not feeling it
incompatible.

<p/>Mentally surrounded with that past again, Bulstrode had the same
pleas--indeed, the years had been perpetually spinning them into
intricate thickness, like masses of spider-web, padding the moral
sensibility; nay, as age made egoism more eager but less enjoying, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
soul had become more saturated with the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did everything
for God's sake, being indifferent to it for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own. And yet--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
could be back in that far-off spot with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) youthful poverty--why, then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would choose to be a missionary.

<p/>But the train of causes in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had locked himself went on. There
was trouble in the fine villa at Highbury. Years before, the only
daughter had run away, defied her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) parents, and gone on the stage; and
now the only boy died, and after a short time Mr. Dunkirk died also.
The wife, a simple pious woman, left with all the wealth in and out of
the magnificent trade, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never knew the precise nature, had
come to believe in Bulstrode, and innocently adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) as women often
adore their priest or <div class="bookquote">``man-made''  (<font color='red'><b>priest minister</b></font>)</div>minister. It was natural that after a
time marriage should have been thought of between them. But Mrs.
Dunkirk had qualms and yearnings about her (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) daughter, who had long been
regarded as lost both to God and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) parents. It was known that the
daughter had married, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was utterly gone out of sight. The
mother, having lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy, imagined a grandson, and wished in a
double sense to reclaim her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were found, there would
be a channel for property--perhaps a wide one--in the provision for
several grandchildren. Efforts to find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must be made before Mrs.
Dunkirk would marry again. Bulstrode concurred; but after
advertisement as well as other modes of inquiry had been tried, the
mother believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter was not to be found, and consented to
marry without reservation of property.

<p/>The daughter had been found; but only one man besides Bulstrode knew
it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was paid for keeping silence and carrying himself away.

<p/>That was the bare fact which Bulstrode was now forced to see in the
rigid outline with which acts present themselves onlookers. But for
himself at that distant time, and even now in burning memory, the fact
was broken into little sequences, each justified as it came by
reasonings which seemed to prove it righteous. Bulstrode's course up
to that time had, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thought, been sanctioned by remarkable
providences, appearing to point the way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to be the agent in
making the best use of a large property and withdrawing it from
perversion. Death and other striking dispositions, such as feminine
trustfulness, had come; and Bulstrode would have adopted Cromwell's
words--<div class="bookquote">``Do you call these bare events? The Lord pity you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cromwell</b></font>)</div>The
events were comparatively small, but the essential condition was
there--namely, that they were in favor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own ends. It was easy
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to settle what was due from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to others by inquiring what
were God's intentions with regard to himself. Could it be for God's
service that this fortune should in any considerable proportion go to a
young woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband who were given up to the lightest pursuits,
and might scatter it abroad in triviality--people who seemed to lie
outside the path of remarkable providences? Bulstrode had never said
to himself beforehand, <div class="bookquote">``The daughter shall not be found'' (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>--nevertheless
when the moment came he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) existence hidden; and when other
moments followed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) soothed the mother with consolation in the
probability that the unhappy young woman might be no more.

<p/>There were hours in which Bulstrode felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) action was
unrighteous; but how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) go back? He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had mental exercises, called
himself nought, laid hold on redemption, and went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) course of
instrumentality. And after five years Death again came to widen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
path, by taking away his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did gradually withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) capital,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did not make the sacrifices requisite to put an end to the
business, which was carried on for thirteen years afterwards before it
finally collapsed. Meanwhile Nicholas Bulstrode had used his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hundred
thousand discreetly, and was become provincially, solidly important--a
banker, a Churchman, a public benefactor; also a sleeping partner in
trading concerns, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchman</b></font>) ability was directed to economy in the
raw material, as in the case of the dyes which rotted Mr. Vincy's silk.
And now, when this respectability had lasted undisturbed for nearly
thirty years--when all that preceded it had long lain benumbed in the
consciousness--that past had risen and immersed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thought as if with
the terrible irruption of a new sense overburthening the feeble being.

<p/>Meanwhile, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) conversation with Raffles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had learned something
momentous, something which entered actively into the struggle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
longings and terrors. There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thought, lay an opening towards
spiritual, perhaps towards material rescue.

<p/>The spiritual kind of rescue was a genuine need with him (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>). There may be
coarse hypocrites, who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the
sake of gulling the world, but Bulstrode was not one of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was
simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) theoretic
beliefs, and who had gradually explained the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs. If this be
hypocrisy, it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all,
to whatever confession we belong, and whether we believe in the future
perfection of our race or in the nearest date fixed for the end of the
world; whether we regard the earth as a putrefying nidus for a saved
remnant, including ourselves, or have a passionate belief in the
solidarity of mankind.

<p/>The service he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could do to the cause of religion had been through life
the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) alleged to himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) choice of action: it had been
the motive which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had poured out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) prayers. Who would use money
and position better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) meant to use them? Who could surpass him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
in self-abhorrence and exaltation of God's cause? And to Mr. Bulstrode
God's cause was something distinct from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own rectitude of conduct:
it enforced a discrimination of God's enemies, who were to be used
merely as instruments, and whom it would be as well if possible to keep
out of money and consequent influence. Also, profitable investments in
trades where the power of the prince of this world showed its most
active devices, became sanctified by a right application of the profits
in the hands of God's servant.

<p/>This implicit reasoning is essentially no more peculiar to evangelical
belief than the use of wide phrases for narrow motives is peculiar to
Englishmen. There is no general doctrine which is not capable of
eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct
fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men.

<p/>But a man who believes in something else than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own greed, has
necessarily a conscience or standard to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more or less adapts
himself. Bulstrode's standard had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) serviceableness to God's
cause: <div class="bookquote">``I am sinful and nought--a vessel to be consecrated by use--but
use me!'' (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>--had been the mould into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had constrained his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) immense
need of being something important and predominating. And now had come
a moment in which that mould seemed in danger of being broken and
utterly cast away.

<p/>What if the acts he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had reconciled himself to because they made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) a
stronger instrument of the divine glory, were to become the pretext of
the scoffer, and a darkening of that glory? If this were to be the
ruling of Providence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was cast out from the temple as one who had
brought unclean offerings.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had long poured out utterances of repentance. But today a
repentance had come which was of a bitterer flavor, and a threatening
Providence urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to a kind of propitiation which was not simply a
doctrinal transaction. The divine tribunal had changed its aspect for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>); self-prostration was no longer enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) must bring
restitution in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hand. It was really before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) God that Bulstrode
was about to attempt such restitution as seemed possible: a great dread
had seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) susceptible frame, and the scorching approach of shame
wrought in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) a new spiritual need. Night and day, while the
resurgent threatening past was making a conscience within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was
thinking by what means he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could recover peace and trust--by what
sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could stay the rod. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) belief in these moments of dread
was, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spontaneously did something right, God would save him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
from the consequences of wrong-doing. For religion can only change when
the emotions which fill it are changed; and the religion of personal
fear remains nearly at the level of the savage.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had seen Raffles actually going away on the Brassing coach, and this
was a temporary relief; it removed the pressure of an immediate dread,
but did not put an end to the spiritual conflict and the need to win
protection. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) came to a difficult resolve, and wrote a letter
to Will Ladislaw, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to be at the Shrubs that evening for a
private interview at nine o'clock. Will had felt no particular surprise
at the request, and connected it with some new notions about the
<div class="bookquote">``Pioneer;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was shown into Mr. Bulstrode's private room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
was struck with the painfully worn look on the banker's face, and was
going to say, <div class="bookquote">``Are you ill?''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>when, checking himself in that abruptness,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) only inquired after Mrs. Bulstrode, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) satisfaction with the
picture bought for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is quite satisfied; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has gone out with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughters
this evening. I begged you to come, Mr. Ladislaw, because I have a
communication of a very private--indeed, I will say, of a sacredly
confidential nature, which I desire to make to you. Nothing, I dare
say, has been farther from your thoughts than that there had been
important ties in the past which could connect your history with mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will felt something like an electric shock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was already in a state
of keen sensitiveness and hardly allayed agitation on the subject of
ties in the past, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) presentiments were not agreeable. It seemed
like the fluctuations of a dream--as if the action begun by that loud
bloated stranger were being carried on by this pale-eyed sickly looking
piece of respectability, whose subdued tone and glib formality of
speech were at this moment almost as repulsive to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as their
remembered contrast. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) answered, with a marked change of color--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see before you, Mr. Ladislaw, a man who is deeply stricken. But
for the urgency of conscience and the knowledge that I am before the
bar of One who seeth not as man seeth, I should be under no compulsion
to make the disclosure which has been my object in asking you to come
here to-night. So far as human laws go, you have no claim on me
whatever.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will was even more uncomfortable than wondering. Mr. Bulstrode had
paused, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hand, and looking at the floor. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
now fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) examining glance on Will and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am told that your mother's name was Sarah Dunkirk, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) ran
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dunkirk</b></font>) friends to go on the stage. Also, that your father was
at one time much emaciated by illness. May I ask if you can confirm
these statements?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are all true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, struck with the order in which an
inquiry had come, that might have been expected to be preliminary to
the banker's previous hints. But Mr. Bulstrode had to-night followed
the order of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) emotions; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) entertained no doubt that the opportunity
for restitution had come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had an overpowering impulse towards
the penitential expression by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was deprecating chastisement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know any particulars of your mother's family?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never liked to speak of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a very generous,
honorable woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, almost angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not wish to allege anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never mention
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother to you at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother did not know the
reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) running away. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said `poor mother' in a pitying tone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That mother became my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, and then paused a moment
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``you have a claim on me, Mr. Ladislaw: as I said
before, not a legal claim, but one which my conscience recognizes. I
was enriched by that marriage--a result which would probably not have
taken place--certainly not to the same extent--if your grandmother
could have discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) daughter. That daughter, I gather, is no
longer living!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Will, feeling suspicion and repugnance rising so strongly
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), that without quite knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hat
from the floor and stood up. The impulse within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was to reject the
disclosed connection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated, Mr. Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Doubtless
you are startled by the suddenness of this discovery. But I entreat
your patience with one who is already bowed down by inward trial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div><p/>Will reseated himself, feeling some pity which was half contempt for
this voluntary self-abasement of an elderly man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is my wish, Mr. Ladislaw, to make amends for the deprivation which
befell your mother. I know that you are without fortune, and I wish to
supply you adequately from a store which would have probably already
been yours had your grandmother been certain of your mother's existence
and been able to find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was performing a striking piece
of scrupulosity in the judgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) auditor, and a penitential act
in the eyes of God. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no clew to the state of Will Ladislaw's
mind, smarting as it was from the clear hints of Raffles, and with its
natural quickness in construction stimulated by the expectation of
discoveries which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would have been glad to conjure back into
darkness. Will made no answer for several moments, till Mr. Bulstrode,
who at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) speech had cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes on the floor, now raised
them with an examining glance, which Will met fully, saying--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you did know of my mother's existence, and knew where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
might have been found.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode shrank--there was a visible quivering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) face and hands.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was totally unprepared to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) advances met in this way, or to
find himself urged into more revelation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had beforehand set down
as needful. But at that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) dared not tell a lie, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt
suddenly uncertain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) ground which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had trodden with some
confidence before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not deny that you conjecture rightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) answered, with a
faltering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``And I wish to make atonement to you as the one
still remaining who has suffered a loss through me. You enter, I
trust, into my purpose, Mr. Ladislaw, which has a reference to higher
than merely human claims, and as I have already said, is entirely
independent of any legal compulsion. I am ready to narrow my own
resources and the prospects of my family by binding myself to allow you
five hundred pounds yearly during my life, and to leave you a
proportional capital at my death--nay, to do still more, if more should
be definitely necessary to any laudable project on your part.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mr.
Bulstrode had gone on to particulars in the expectation that these
would work strongly on Ladislaw, and merge other feelings in grateful
acceptance.

<p/>But Will was looking as stubborn as possible, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lip pouting and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) side-pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was not in the least touched, and
said firmly,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Before I make any reply to your proposition, Mr. Bulstrode, I must beg
you to answer a question or two. Were you connected with the business
by which that fortune you speak of was originally made?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode's thought was, <div class="bookquote">``Raffles has told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
refuse to answer when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had volunteered what drew forth the question?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And was that business--or was it not--a thoroughly dishonorable
one--nay, one that, if its nature had been made public, might have
ranked those concerned in it with thieves and convicts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Will's tone had a cutting bitterness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was moved to put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) question
as nakedly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could.

<p/>Bulstrode reddened with irrepressible anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been prepared for
a scene of self-abasement, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) intense pride and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) habit of
supremacy overpowered penitence, and even dread, when this young man,
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had meant to benefit, turned on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the air of a judge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The business was established before I became connected with it, sir;
nor is it for you to institute an inquiry of that kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) answered,
not raising his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) voice, but speaking with quick defiantness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, starting up again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hand.
<div class="bookquote">``It is eminently mine to ask such questions, when I have to decide
whether I will have transactions with you and accept your money. My
unblemished honor is important to me. It is important to me to have no
stain on my birth and connections. And now I find there is a stain
which I can't help. My mother felt it, and tried to keep as clear of
it as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could, and so will I. You shall keep your ill-gotten money.
If I had any fortune of my own, I would willingly pay it to any one who
could disprove what you have told me. What I have to thank you for is
that you kept the money till now, when I can refuse it. It ought to
lie with a man's self that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a gentleman. Good-night, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode was going to speak, but Will, with determined quickness, was
out of the room in an instant, and in another the hall-door had closed
behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was too strongly possessed with passionate rebellion
against this inherited blot which had been thrust on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knowledge to
reflect at present whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not been too hard on Bulstrode--too
arrogantly merciless towards a man of sixty, who was making efforts at
retrieval when time had rendered them vain.

<p/>No third person listening could have thoroughly understood the
impetuosity of Will's repulse or the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words. No one
but himself then knew how everything connected with the sentiment of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own dignity had an immediate bearing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relation to
Dorothea and to Mr. Casaubon's treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And in the rush of
impulses by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung back that offer of Bulstrode's there was
mingled the sense that it would have been impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) ever to
tell Dorothea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had accepted it.

<p/>As for Bulstrode--when Will was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) suffered a violent reaction,
and wept like a woman. It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had encountered an
open expression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with
that scorn hurrying like venom through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) system, there was no
sensibility left to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be
checked. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and daughters soon came home from hearing the
address of an Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa
had not heard, in the first instance, the interesting things which they
tried to repeat to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).

<p/>Perhaps, through all other hidden thoughts, the one that breathed most
comfort was, that Will Ladislaw at least was not likely to publish what
had taken place that evening.



<p/>CHAPTER LXII.

<p/>``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a squyer of lowe degre,
That loved the king's daughter of Hungrie.
--Old Romance.


<p/>Will Ladislaw's mind was now wholly bent on seeing Dorothea again, and
forthwith quitting Middlemarch. The morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) agitating scene
with Bulstrode he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) wrote a brief letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), saying that various
causes had detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) in the neighborhood longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had
expected, and asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) permission to call again at Lowick at some
hour which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would mention on the earliest possible day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) being
anxious to depart, but unwilling to do so until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had granted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) an
interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) left the letter at the office, ordering the messenger to
carry it to Lowick Manor, and wait for an answer.

<p/>Ladislaw felt the awkwardness of asking for more last words. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
former farewell had been made in the hearing of Sir James Chettam, and
had been announced as final even to the butler. It is certainly trying
to a man's dignity to reappear when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not expected to do so: a
first farewell has pathos in it, but to come back for a second lends an
opening to comedy, and it was possible even that there might be bitter
sneers afloat about Will's motives for lingering. Still it was on the
whole more satisfactory to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) feeling to take the directest means of
seeing Dorothea, than to use any device which might give an air of
chance to a meeting of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to understand that it was
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) earnestly sought. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had
been in ignorance of facts which gave a new aspect to the relation
between them, and made a more absolute severance than he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had then
believed in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knew nothing of Dorothea's private fortune, and being
little used to reflect on such matters, took it for granted that
according to Mr. Casaubon's arrangement marriage to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), Will Ladislaw,
would mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) consented to be penniless. That was not what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
could wish for even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) secret heart, or even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been ready
to meet such hard contrast for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) sake. And then, too, there was the
fresh smart of that disclosure about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) mother's family, which if
known would be an added reason why Dorothea's friends should look down
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) as utterly below her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). The secret hope that after some years
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) might come back with the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had at least a personal value
equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wealth, seemed now the dreamy continuation of a dream.
This change would surely justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) in asking Dorothea to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
once more.

<p/>But Dorothea on that morning was not at home to receive Will's note.
In consequence of a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle announcing his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) intention to
be at home in a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had driven first to Freshitt to carry the
news, meaning to go on to the Grange to deliver some orders with which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle had intrusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--thinking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``a little mental
occupation of this sort good for a widow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If Will Ladislaw could have overheard some of the talk at Freshitt that
morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would have felt all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) suppositions confirmed as to the
readiness of certain people to sneer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) lingering in the
neighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning
Dorothea, had been on the watch to learn Ladislaw's movements, and had
an instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>)
confidence on this matter. That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch
nearly two months after he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) had declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Standish</b></font>) was going immediately,
was a fact to embitter Sir James's suspicions, or at least to justify
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) aversion to a <div class="bookquote">``young fellow''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>whom he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) represented to himself as
slight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as
naturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a
strict profession. But he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had just heard something from Standish
which, while it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of
nullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea.

<p/>Unwonted circumstances may make us all rather unlike ourselves: there
are conditions under which the most majestic person is obliged to
sneeze, and our emotions are liable to be acted on in the same
incongruous manner. Good Sir James was this morning so far unlike
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was irritably anxious to say something to Dorothea on a
subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) usually avoided as if it had been a matter of shame to
them both. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could not use Celia as a medium, because he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not
choose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) should know the kind of gossip he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mind; and
before Dorothea happened to arrive he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had been trying to imagine how,
with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) shyness and unready tongue, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) could ever manage to introduce
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) communication. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) unexpected presence brought him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to utter
hopelessness in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own power of saying anything unpleasant; but
desperation suggested a resource; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sent the groom on an unsaddled
horse across the park with a pencilled note to Mrs. Cadwallader, who
already knew the gossip, and would think it no compromise of herself to
repeat it as often as required.

<p/>Dorothea was detained on the good pretext that Mr. Garth, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
wanted to see, was expected at the hall within the hour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
still talking to Caleb on the gravel when Sir James, on the watch for
the rector's wife, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coming and met her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with the needful hints.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Enough! I understand,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>--said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``You shall be
innocent. I am such a blackamoor that I cannot smirch myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that it's of any consequence,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, disliking
that Mrs. Cadwallader should understand too much. <div class="bookquote">``Only it is
desirable that Dorothea should know there are reasons why she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should
not receive him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) again; and I really can't say so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). It will come
lightly from you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It came very lightly indeed. When Dorothea quitted Caleb and turned to
meet them, it appeared that Mrs. Cadwallader had stepped across the
park by the merest chance in the world, just to chat with Celia in a
matronly way about the baby. And so Mr. Brooke was coming back?
Delightful!--coming back, it was to be hoped, quite cured of
Parliamentary fever and pioneering. Apropos of the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer'' (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>--somebody
had prophesied that it would soon be like a dying dolphin, and turn all
colors for want of knowing how to help itself, because Mr. Brooke's
protege, the brilliant young Ladislaw, was gone or going. Had Sir
James heard that?

<p/>The three were walking along the gravel slowly, and Sir James, turning
aside to whip a shrub, said he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had heard something of that sort.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All false!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. ``He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is not gone, or going,
apparently; the <div class="bookquote">``Pioneer' keeps its color, and Mr. Orlando Ladislaw is
making a sad dark-blue scandal by warbling continually with your Mr.
Lydgate's wife, who they tell me is as pretty as pretty can be. It
seems nobody ever goes into the house without finding this young
gentleman lying on the rug or warbling at the piano. But the people in
manufacturing towns are always disreputable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You began by saying that one report was false, Mrs. Cadwallader, and I
believe this is false too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with indignant energy; <div class="bookquote">``at
least, I feel sure it is a misrepresentation. I will not hear any evil
spoken of Mr. Ladislaw; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has already suffered too much injustice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea when thoroughly moved cared little what any one thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
feelings; and even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been able to reflect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would have held
it petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of
being herself misunderstood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face was flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lip trembled.

<p/>Sir James, glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), repented of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) stratagem; but Mrs.
Cadwallader, equal to all occasions, spread the palms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) hands
outward and said--<div class="bookquote">``Heaven grant it, my dear!--I mean that all bad tales
about anybody may be false. But it is a pity that young Lydgate should
have married one of these Middlemarch girls. Considering he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)'s a son of
somebody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might have got a woman with good blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) veins, and
not too young, who would have put up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession. There's
Clara Harfager, for instance, whose friends don't know what to do with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) has a portion. Then we might have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) among us.
However!--it's no use being wise for other people. Where is Celia?
Pray let us go in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going on immediately to Tipton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rather haughtily.
<div class="bookquote">``Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James could say nothing as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
was altogether discontented with the result of a contrivance which had
cost him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) some secret humiliation beforehand.

<p/>Dorothea drove along between the berried hedgerows and the shorn
corn-fields, not seeing or hearing anything around. The tears came and
rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheeks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not know it. The world, it seemed,
was turning ugly and hateful, and there was no place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
trustfulness. <div class="bookquote">``It is not true--it is not true!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was the voice within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) listened to; but all the while a remembrance to which
there had always clung a vague uneasiness would thrust itself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
attention--the remembrance of that day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had found Will Ladislaw
with Mrs. Lydgate, and had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) voice accompanied by the piano.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would never do anything that I disapproved--I wish I could
have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that I disapproved of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said poor Dorothea,
inwardly, feeling a strange alternation between anger with Will and the
passionate defence of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``They all try to blacken him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) before me; but
I will care for no pain, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is not to blame. I always believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was good.'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) last thoughts before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that the
carriage was passing under the archway of the lodge-gate at the Grange,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hurriedly pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face and began to
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) errands. The coachman begged leave to take out the horses
for half an hour as there was something wrong with a shoe; and
Dorothea, having the sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was going to rest, took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
gloves and bonnet, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was leaning against a statue in the
entrance-hall, and talking to the housekeeper. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must stay here a little, Mrs. Kell. I will go into the library and
write you some memoranda from my uncle's letter, if you will open the
shutters for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The shutters are open, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kell</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kell, following Dorothea, who
had walked along as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw is there, looking for
something.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Will had come to fetch a portfolio of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own sketches which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
missed in the act of packing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) movables, and did not choose to leave
behind.-RRB-

<p/>Dorothea's heart seemed to turn over as if it had had a blow, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was not perceptibly checked: in truth, the sense that Will was there
was for the moment all-satisfying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), like the sight of something
precious that one has lost. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reached the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to Mrs.
Kell--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go in first, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) that I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kell</b></font>)</div><p/>Will had found his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) portfolio, and had laid it on the table at the far
end of the room, to turn over the sketches and please himself by
looking at the memorable piece of art which had a relation to nature
too mysterious for Dorothea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was smiling at it still, and shaking
the sketches into order with the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) might find a letter
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) at Middlemarch, when Mrs. Kell close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) elbow
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Casaubon is coming in, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kell</b></font>)</div><p/>Will turned round quickly, and the next moment Dorothea was entering.
As Mrs. Kell closed the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Kell</b></font>) they met: each was looking at
the other, and consciousness was overflowed by something that
suppressed utterance. It was not confusion that kept them silent, for
they both felt that parting was near, and there is no shamefacedness in
a sad parting.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kell</b></font>) moved automatically towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Kell</b></font>) uncle's chair against the
writing-table, and Will, after drawing it out a little for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kell</b></font>), went a
few paces off and stood opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kell</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lap; <div class="bookquote">``I am
very glad you were here.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Will thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face looked just as it
did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) first shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) in Rome; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) widow's cap,
fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) bonnet, had gone off with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had lately been shedding tears. But the mixture of anger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
agitation had vanished at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been used, when
they were face to face, always to feel confidence and the happy freedom
which comes with mutual understanding, and how could other people's
words hinder that effect on a sudden? Let the music which can take
possession of our frame and fill the air with joy for us, sound once
more--what does it signify that we heard it found fault with in its
absence?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sent a letter to Lowick Manor to-day, asking leave to see you,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, seating himself opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am going away
immediately, and I could not go without speaking to you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought we had parted when you came to Lowick many weeks ago--you
thought you were going then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice trembling a
little.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but I was in ignorance then of things which I know now--things
which have altered my feelings about the future. When I saw you
before, I was dreaming that I might come back some day. I don't think
I ever shall--now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will paused here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wished me to know the reasons?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, timidly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, impetuously, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head backward, and looking
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with irritation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Of course I must wish it.
I have been grossly insulted in your eyes and in the eyes of others.
There has been a mean implication against my character. I wish you to
know that under no circumstances would I have lowered myself by--under
no circumstances would I have given men the chance of saying that I
sought money under the pretext of seeking--something else. There was
no need of other safeguard against me--the safeguard of wealth was
enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) chair with the last word and went--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hardly knew
where; but it was to the projecting window nearest him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), which had been
open as now about the same season a year ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) and Dorothea had
stood within it and talked together. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) whole heart was going out at
this moment in sympathy with Will's indignation: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) only wanted to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never done him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) injustice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) seemed to
have turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) too had been part of the unfriendly
world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very unkind of you to suppose that I ever attributed any
meanness to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) began. Then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ardent way, wanting to plead
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) moved from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) chair and went in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) old
place in the window, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose that I ever disbelieved in
you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When Will saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) gave a start and moved backward out of the
window, without meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) glance. Dorothea was hurt by this movement
following up the previous anger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) tone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was ready to say that
it was as hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as on him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was helpless; but those
strange particulars of their relation which neither of them could
explicitly mention kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) always in dread of saying too much. At
this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had no belief that Will would in any case have wanted
to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feared using words which might imply such a
belief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) only said earnestly, recurring to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) last word--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure no safeguard was ever needed against you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>Will did not answer. In the stormy fluctuation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) feelings these
words of hers seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) cruelly neutral, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) looked pale and
miserable after his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) angry outburst. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) went to the table and fastened
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) portfolio, while Dorothea looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) from the distance. They
were wasting these last moments together in wretched silence. What
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) say, since what had got obstinately uppermost in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind was
the passionate love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) forbade himself to utter? What
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) say, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) no help--since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was forced
to keep the money that ought to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)?--since to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) seemed
not to respond as he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) used to do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thorough trust and liking?

<p/>But Will at last turned away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) portfolio and approached the
window again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said, with that peculiar look of the eyes which
sometimes accompanies bitter feeling, as if they had been tired and
burned with gazing too close at a light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall you do in life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, timidly. <div class="bookquote">``Have your
intentions remained just the same as when we said good-by before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, in a tone that seemed to waive the subject as
uninteresting. <div class="bookquote">``I shall work away at the first thing that offers. I
suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, what sad words!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with a dangerous tendency to sob.
Then trying to smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``We used to agree that we were alike
in speaking too strongly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not spoken too strongly now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, leaning back against
the angle of the wall. <div class="bookquote">``There are certain things which a man can only
go through once in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must know some time or other that
the best is over with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This experience has happened to me while I
am very young--that is all. What I care more for than I can ever care
for anything else is absolutely forbidden to me--I don't mean merely
by being out of my reach, but forbidden me, even if it were within my
reach, by my own pride and honor--by everything I respect myself for.
Of course I shall go on living as a man might do who had seen heaven in
a trance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Will paused, imagining that it would be impossible for Dorothea to
misunderstand this; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was contradicting himself
and offending against his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) self-approval in speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) so plainly;
but still--it could not be fairly called wooing a woman to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would never woo her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It must be admitted to be a ghostly kind
of wooing.

<p/>But Dorothea's mind was rapidly going over the past with quite another
vision than his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). The thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself might be what Will most
cared for did throb through her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) an instant, but then came doubt: the
memory of the little they had lived through together turned pale and
shrank before the memory which suggested how much fuller might have
been the intercourse between Will and some one else with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had
had constant companionship. Everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had said might refer to that
other relation, and whatever had passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) and herself was
thoroughly explained by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had always regarded as their simple
friendship and the cruel obstruction thrust upon it by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
injurious act. Dorothea stood silent, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes cast down
dreamily, while images crowded upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) which left the sickening
certainty that Will was referring to Mrs. Lydgate. But why sickening?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to know that here too his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) conduct should be above
suspicion.

<p/>Will was not surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) silence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind also was tumultuously
busy while he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was feeling rather wildly that
something must happen to hinder their parting--some miracle, clearly
nothing in their own deliberate speech. Yet, after all, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) any
love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could not pretend to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would rather
believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to be without that pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) could not deny that a secret
longing for the assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was at the root of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
words.

<p/>Neither of them knew how long they stood in that way. Dorothea was
raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes, and was about to speak, when the door opened and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
footman came to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The horses are ready, madam, whenever you like to start.''

 (<font color='red'><b>footman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Presently,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. Then turning to Will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have
some memoranda to write for the housekeeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, when the door had closed again--advancing
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``The day after to-morrow I shall leave Middlemarch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have acted in every way rightly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a low tone,
feeling a pressure at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart which made it difficult to speak.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand, and Will took it for an instant without speaking,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) words had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) cruelly cold and unlike herself. Their
eyes met, but there was discontent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and in hers there was only
sadness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) turned away and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) portfolio under his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) arm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
repressing a rising sob.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, with irritation. <div class="bookquote">``As if I were
not in danger of forgetting everything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had really a movement of anger against her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at that moment, and it
impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) to go away without pause. It was all one flash to
Dorothea--his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) last words--his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) distant bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) reached the
door--the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was no longer there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sank into the chair,
and for a few moments sat like a statue, while images and emotions were
hurrying upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Joy came first, in spite of the threatening train
behind it--joy in the impression that it was really herself whom Will
loved and was renouncing, that there was really no other love less
permissible, more blameworthy, which honor was hurrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) away from.
They were parted all the same, but--Dorothea drew a deep breath and
felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) strength return--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) unrestrainedly. At
that moment the parting was easy to bear: the first sense of loving and
being loved excluded sorrow. It was as if some hard icy pressure had
melted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) consciousness had room to expand: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) past was come
back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with larger interpretation. The joy was not the
less--perhaps it was the more complete just then--because of the
irrevocable parting; for there was no reproach, no contemptuous wonder
to imagine in any eye or from any lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had acted so as to defy
reproach, and make wonder respectful.

<p/>Any one watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have seen that there was a fortifying
thought within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Just as when inventive power is working with glad
ease some small claim on the attention is fully met as if it were only
a cranny opened to the sunlight, it was easy now for Dorothea to write
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) memoranda. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) last words to the housekeeper in cheerful
tones, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seated herself in the carriage her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes were bright
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheeks blooming under the dismal bonnet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) threw back the
heavy <div class="bookquote">``weepers,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and looked before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), wondering which road Will had
taken. It was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) nature to be proud that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was blameless, and
through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feelings there ran this vein--<div class="bookquote">``I was right to defend
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The coachman was used to drive his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) grays at a good pace, Mr. Casaubon
being unenjoying and impatient in everything away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) desk, and
wanting to get to the end of all journeys; and Dorothea was now bowled
along quickly. Driving was pleasant, for rain in the night had laid
the dust, and the blue sky looked far off, away from the region of the
great clouds that sailed in masses. The earth looked like a happy
place under the vast heavens, and Dorothea was wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might
overtake Will and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) once more.

<p/>After a turn of the road, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was with the portfolio under his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
arm; but the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hat,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt a pang at being seated there in a sort of exaltation,
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not look back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). It was as if a
crowd of indifferent objects had thrust them asunder, and forced them
along different paths, taking them farther and farther away from each
other, and making it useless to look back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could no more make any
sign that would seem to say, <div class="bookquote">``Need we part?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could stop the
carriage to wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>). Nay, what a world of reasons crowded upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) against any movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought towards a future that might
reverse the decision of this day!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I only wish I had known before--I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew--then we could be quite
happy in thinking of each other, though we are forever parted. And if
I could but have given him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the money, and made things easier for
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--were the longings that came back the most persistently. And
yet, so heavily did the world weigh on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) independent
energy, that with this idea of Will as in need of such help and at a
disadvantage with the world, there came always the vision of that
unfittingness of any closer relation between them which lay in the
opinion of every one connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt to the full all the
imperativeness of the motives which urged Will's conduct. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
dream of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) defying the barrier that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband had placed between
them?--how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ever say to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would defy it?

<p/>Will's certainty as the carriage grew smaller in the distance, had much
more bitterness in it. Very slight matters were enough to gall him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sensitive mood, and the sight of Dorothea driving past him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
felt himself plodding along as a poor devil seeking a position in a
world which in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) present temper offered him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) little that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coveted,
made his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) conduct seem a mere matter of necessity, and took away the
sustainment of resolve. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had no assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) loved
him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>): could any man pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was simply glad in such a case to
have the suffering all on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own side?

<p/>That evening Will spent with the Lydgates; the next evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>CHAPTER LXIII.

<p/>These little things are great to little man.--GOLDSMITH.


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you seen much of your scientific phoenix, Lydgate, lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Toller at one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) Christmas dinner-parties, speaking to Mr.
Farebrother on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) right hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not much, I am sorry to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>answered the Vicar, accustomed to parry
Mr. Toller's banter about his (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) belief in the new medical light. <div class="bookquote">``I am
out of the way and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is too busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)? I am glad to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>said Dr. Minchin, with mingled suavity
and surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gives a great deal of time to the New Hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Farebrother, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) reasons for continuing the subject: <div class="bookquote">``I hear of
that from my neighbor, Mrs. Casaubon, who goes there often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) says
Lydgate is indefatigable, and is making a fine thing of Bulstrode's
institution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is preparing a new ward in case of the cholera coming
to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And preparing theories of treatment to try on the patients, I
suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Toller, be candid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother. <div class="bookquote">``You are too clever
not to see the good of a bold fresh mind in medicine, as well as in
everything else; and as to cholera, I fancy, none of you are very sure
what you ought to do. If a man goes a little too far along a new road,
it is usually himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) harms more than any one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you and Wrench ought to be obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Minchin/Minchin</b></font>)</div>said Dr.
Minchin, looking towards Toller, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sent you the cream of
Peacock's patients.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lydgate has been living at a great rate for a young beginner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Harry Toller, the brewer. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) relations in the North
back him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Chichely, <div class="bookquote">``else he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ought not to have married that
nice girl we were all so fond of. Hang it, one has a grudge against a
man who carries off the prettiest girl in the town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, by God! and the best too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Standish/Standish</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Standish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My friend Vincy didn't half like the marriage, I know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Chichely. <div class="bookquote">''_He (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>)_ wouldn't do much. How the relations on the other side
may have come down I can't say.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Chichely/Chichely</b></font>)</div>There was an emphatic kind of
reticence in Mr. Chichely's manner of speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I shouldn't think Lydgate ever looked to practice for a living,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Toller, with a slight touch of sarcasm, and there the subject
was dropped.

<p/>This was not the first time that Mr. Farebrother had heard hints of
Lydgate's expenses being obviously too great to be met by his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) practice,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) thought it not unlikely that there were resources or
expectations which excused the large outlay at the time of Lydgate's
marriage, and which might hinder any bad consequences from the
disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice. One evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took the pains to
go to Middlemarch on purpose to have a chat with Lydgate as of old, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) an air of excited effort quite unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) usual easy way
of keeping silence or breaking it with abrupt energy whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
anything to say. Lydgate talked persistently when they were in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
work-room, putting arguments for and against the probability of certain
biological views; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had none of those definite things to say or to
show which give the waymarks of a patient uninterrupted pursuit, such
as he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) used himself to insist on, saying that <div class="bookquote">``there must be a systole
and diastole in all inquiry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``a man's mind must be
continually expanding and shrinking between the whole human horizon and
the horizon of an object-glass.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) seemed to be talking
widely for the sake of resisting any personal bearing; and before long
they went into the drawing room, where Lydgate, having asked Rosamond
to give them music, sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair in silence, but with a
strange light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have been taking an opiate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>was a
thought that crossed Mr. Farebrother's mind--<div class="bookquote">``tic-douloureux
perhaps--or medical worries.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>It did not occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) that Lydgate's marriage was not delightful: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
believed, as the rest did, that Rosamond was an amiable, docile
creature, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had always thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) rather uninteresting--a
little too much the pattern-card of the finishing-school; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mother could not forgive Rosamond because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never seemed to see that
Henrietta Noble was in the room. <div class="bookquote">``However, Lydgate fell in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) must be to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) taste.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother was aware that Lydgate was a proud man, but having very
little corresponding fibre in himself, and perhaps too little care
about personal dignity, except the dignity of not being mean or
foolish, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could hardly allow enough for the way in which Lydgate
shrank, as from a burn, from the utterance of any word about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
private affairs. And soon after that conversation at Mr. Toller's, the
Vicar learned something which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Toller</b></font>) watch the more eagerly for an
opportunity of indirectly letting Lydgate know that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wanted to
open himself about any difficulty there was a friendly ear ready.

<p/>The opportunity came at Mr. Vincy's, where, on New Year's Day, there
was a party, to which Mr. Farebrother was irresistibly invited, on the
plea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) must not forsake his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) old friends on the first new year of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) being a greater man, and Rector as well as Vicar. And this party
was thoroughly friendly: all the ladies of the Farebrother family were
present; the Vincy children all dined at the table, and Fred had
persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not invite Mary Garth, the
Farebrothers would regard it as a slight to themselves, Mary being
their particular friend. Mary came, and Fred was in high spirits,
though his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) enjoyment was of a checkered kind--triumph that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mother
should see Mary's importance with the chief personages in the party
being much streaked with jealousy when Mr. Farebrother sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
Fred used to be much more easy about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) own accomplishments in the
days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had not begun to dread being <div class="bookquote">``bowled out by Farebrother,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and this terror was still before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>). Mrs. Vincy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) fullest
matronly bloom, looked at Mary's little figure, rough wavy hair, and
visage quite without lilies and roses, and wondered; trying
unsuccessfully to fancy herself caring about Mary's appearance in
wedding clothes, or feeling complacency in grandchildren who would
<div class="bookquote">``feature''  (<font color='red'><b>grandchildren feature</b></font>)</div>the Garths. However, the party was a merry one, and Mary was
particularly bright; being glad, for Fred's sake, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) friends were
getting kinder to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and being also quite willing that they should
see how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was valued by others whom they must admit to be judges.

<p/>Mr. Farebrother noticed that Lydgate seemed bored, and that Mr. Vincy
spoke as little as possible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) son-in-law. Rosamond was perfectly
graceful and calm, and only a subtle observation such as the Vicar had
not been roused to bestow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have perceived the total absence
of that interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's presence which a loving wife is sure
to betray, even if etiquette keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aloof from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). When Lydgate
was taking part in the conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) any
more than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been a sculptured Psyche modelled to look another
way: and when, after being called out for an hour or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) re-entered
the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) seemed unconscious of the fact, which eighteen months
before would have had the effect of a numeral before ciphers. In
reality, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was intensely aware of Lydgate's voice and
movements; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pretty good-tempered air of unconsciousness was a
studied negation by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) inward opposition to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
without compromise of propriety. When the ladies were in the
drawing-room after Lydgate had been called away from the dessert, Mrs.
Farebrother, when Rosamond happened to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>), said--<div class="bookquote">``You have to
give up a great deal of your husband's society, Mrs. Lydgate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the life of a medical man is very arduous: especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
so devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profession as Mr. Lydgate is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, who was
standing, and moved easily away at the end of this correct little
speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is dreadfully dull for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) when there is no company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Vincy, who was seated at the old lady's side. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure I thought so
when Rosamond was ill, and I was staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). You know, Mrs.
Farebrother, ours is a cheerful house. I am of a cheerful disposition
myself, and Mr. Vincy always likes something to be going on. That is
what Rosamond has been used to. Very different from a husband out at
odd hours, and never knowing when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will come home, and of a close,
proud disposition, _I_ think'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>--indiscreet Mrs. Vincy did lower her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) tone
slightly with this parenthesis. <div class="bookquote">``But Rosamond always had an angel of a
temper; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) brothers used very often not to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was
never the girl to show temper; from a baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was always as good as
good, and with a complexion beyond anything. But my children are all
good-tempered, thank God.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>This was easily credible to any one looking at Mrs. Vincy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) threw
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) broad cap-strings, and smiled towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) three little girls,
aged from seven to eleven. But in that smiling glance she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was obliged
to include Mary Garth, whom the three girls had got into a corner to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) tell them stories. Mary was just finishing the delicious tale
of Rumpelstiltskin, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had well by heart, because Letty was
never tired of communicating it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) ignorant elders from a favorite
red volume. Louisa, Mrs. Vincy's darling, now ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) with
wide-eyed serious excitement, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Oh mamma, mamma, the little man
stamped so hard on the floor he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg out again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, my cherub!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>said mamma; <div class="bookquote">``you shall tell me all about it
to-morrow. Go and listen!''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>and then, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) eyes followed Louisa back
towards the attractive corner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) thought that if Fred wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) to
invite Mary again she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would make no objection, the children being so
pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>But presently the corner became still more animated, for Mr.
Farebrother came in, and seating himself behind Louisa, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
lap; whereupon the girls all insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) must hear
Rumpelstiltskin, and Mary must tell it over again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) insisted too,
and Mary, without fuss, began again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) neat fashion, with precisely
the same words as before. Fred, who had also seated himself near,
would have felt unmixed triumph in Mary's effectiveness if Mr.
Farebrother had not been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with evident admiration, while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) dramatized an intense interest in the tale to please the children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will never care any more about my one-eyed giant, Loo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred
at the end.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I shall. Tell about him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div>said Louisa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I dare say; I am quite cut out. Ask Mr. Farebrother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>added Mary; <div class="bookquote">``ask Mr. Farebrother to tell you about the ants
whose beautiful house was knocked down by a giant named Tom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
thought they didn't mind because he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) couldn't hear them cry, or see them
use their pocket-handkerchiefs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, looking up at the Vicar.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, I am a grave old parson. If I try to draw a story out of my
bag a sermon comes instead. Shall I preach you a sermon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>),
putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) short-sighted glasses, and pursing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, falteringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see, then. Against cakes: how cakes are bad things, especially
if they are sweet and have plums in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa took the affair rather seriously, and got down from the Vicar's
knee to go to Fred.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I see it will not do to preach on New Year's Day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Farebrother, rising and walking away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had discovered of late that
Fred had become jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>), and also that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) himself was not losing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) preference for Mary above all other women.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A delightful young person is Miss Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, who
had been watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) son's movements.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Vincy, obliged to reply, as the old lady turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
expectantly. <div class="bookquote">``It is a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) is not better-looking.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot say that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, decisively. <div class="bookquote">``I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
countenance. We must not always ask for beauty, when a good God has
seen fit to make an excellent young woman without it. I put good
manners first, and Miss Garth will know how to conduct herself in any
station.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The old lady was a little sharp in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tone, having a prospective
reference to Mary's becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) daughter-in-law; for there was this
inconvenience in Mary's position with regard to Fred, that it was not
suitable to be made public, and hence the three ladies at Lowick
Parsonage were still hoping that Camden would choose Miss Garth.

<p/>New visitors entered, and the drawing-room was given up to music and
games, while whist-tables were prepared in the quiet room on the other
side of the hall. Mr. Farebrother played a rubber to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
mother, who regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) occasional whist as a protest against scandal
and novelty of opinion, in which light even a revoke had its dignity.
But at the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) got Mr. Chichely to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) place, and left the
room. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) crossed the hall, Lydgate had just come in and was taking
off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) great-coat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are the man I was going to look for,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar; and instead
of entering the drawing-room, they walked along the hall and stood
against the fireplace, where the frosty air helped to make a glowing
bank. <div class="bookquote">``You see, I can leave the whist-table easily enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) went
on, smiling at Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``now I don't play for money. I owe that to
you, Mrs. Casaubon says.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, coldly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you didn't mean me to know it; I call that ungenerous reticence.
You should let a man have the pleasure of feeling that you have done
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a good turn. I don't enter into some people's dislike of being
under an obligation: upon my word, I prefer being under an obligation
to everybody for behaving well to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell what you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``unless it is that I once
spoke of you to Mrs. Casaubon. But I did not think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would
break her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) promise not to mention that I had done so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) back against the corner of the mantel-piece, and showing no
radiance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was Brooke who let it out, only the other day. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paid me the
compliment of saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very glad I had the living though you
had come across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tactics, and had praised me up as a lien and a
Tillotson, and that sort of thing, till Mrs. Casaubon would hear of no
one else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, Brooke is such a leaky-minded fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, contemptuously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I was glad of the leakiness then. I don't see why you shouldn't
like me to know that you wished to do me a service, my dear fellow.
And you certainly have done me one. It's rather a strong check to
one's self-complacency to find how much of one's right doing depends on
not being in want of money. A man will not be tempted to say the
Lord's Prayer backward to please the devil, if he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) doesn't want the
devil's services. I have no need to hang on the smiles of chance now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't see that there's any money-getting without chance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``if a man gets it in a profession, it's pretty sure to come by
chance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could account for this speech, in striking
contrast with Lydgate's former way of talking, as the perversity which
will often spring from the moodiness of a man ill at ease in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
affairs. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered in a tone of good-humored admission--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's enormous patience wanted with the way of the world. But
it is the easier for a man to wait patiently when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has friends who
love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and ask for nothing better than to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) through, so far
as it lies in their power.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in a careless tone, changing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) attitude and
looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) watch. <div class="bookquote">``People make much more of their difficulties
than they need to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew as distinctly as possible that this was an offer of help to
himself from Mr. Farebrother, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) could not bear it. So strangely
determined are we mortals, that, after having been long gratified with
the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had privately done the Vicar a service, the
suggestion that the Vicar discerned his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) need of a service in return
made him (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) shrink into unconquerable reticence. Besides, behind all
making of such offers what else must come?--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) should <div class="bookquote">``mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wanted specific things. At that moment, suicide
seemed easier.

<p/>Mr. Farebrother was too keen a man not to know the meaning of that
reply, and there was a certain massiveness in Lydgate's manner and
tone, corresponding with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) physique, which if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) repelled your
advances in the first instance seemed to put persuasive devices out of
question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What time are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, devouring his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) wounded feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. And they went into the drawing-room.



<p/>CHAPTER LXIV.

<p/>1st Gent. Where lies the power, there let the blame lie too.
2d Gent. Nay, power is relative; you cannot fright
The coming pest with border fortresses,
Or catch your carp with subtle argument.
All force is twain in one: cause is not cause
Unless effect be there; and action's self
Must needs contain a passive. So command
Exists but with obedience.''


<p/>Even if Lydgate had been inclined to be quite open about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) affairs,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew that it would have hardly been in Mr. Farebrother's power to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) the help he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) immediately wanted. With the year's bills coming
in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) tradesmen, with Dover's threatening hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) furniture,
and with nothing to depend on but slow dribbling payments from patients
who must not be offended--for the handsome fees he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had had from
Freshitt Hall and Lowick Manor had been easily absorbed--nothing less
than a thousand pounds would have freed him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) from actual embarrassment,
and left a residue which, according to the favorite phrase of
hopefulness in such circumstances, would have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``time to look
about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Naturally, the merry Christmas bringing the happy New Year, when
fellow-citizens expect to be paid for the trouble and goods they have
smilingly bestowed on their neighbors, had so tightened the pressure of
sordid cares on Lydgate's mind that it was hardly possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to
think unbrokenly of any other subject, even the most habitual and
soliciting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not an ill-tempered man; his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intellectual activity,
the ardent kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heart, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) strong frame, would
always, under tolerably easy conditions, have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) above the petty
uncontrolled susceptibilities which make bad temper. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was now a
prey to that worst irritation which arises not simply from annoyances,
but from the second consciousness underlying those annoyances, of
wasted energy and a degrading preoccupation, which was the reverse of
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) former purposes. <div class="bookquote">''_This_ is what I am thinking of; and _that_
is what I might have been thinking of,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the bitter incessant murmur
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), making every difficulty a double goad to impatience.

<p/>Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general
discontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which their
great souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self
and an insignificant world may have its consolations. Lydgate's
discontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a
grand existence in thought and effective action lying around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic
fears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) troubles will perhaps appear miserably sordid, and beneath the
attention of lofty persons who can know nothing of debt except on a
magnificent scale. Doubtless they were sordid; and for the majority,
who are not lofty, there is no escape from sordidness but by being free
from money-craving, with all its base hopes and temptations, its
watching for death, its hinted requests, its horse-dealer's desire to
make bad work pass for good, its seeking for function which ought to be
another's, its compulsion often to long for Luck in the shape of a wide
calamity.

<p/>It was because Lydgate writhed under the idea of getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) neck
beneath this vile yoke that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had fallen into a bitter moody state
which was continually widening Rosamond's alienation from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). After
the first disclosure about the bill of sale, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had made many efforts
to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) about possible measures for
narrowing their expenses, and with the threatening approach of
Christmas his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) propositions grew more and more definite. <div class="bookquote">``We two can do
with only one servant, and live on very little,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I shall
manage with one horse.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For Lydgate, as we have seen, had begun to
reason, with a more distinct vision, about the expenses of living, and
any share of pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had given to appearances of that sort was meagre
compared with the pride which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) revolt from exposure as a
debtor, or from asking men to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with their money.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you can dismiss the other two servants, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond; <div class="bookquote">``but I should have thought it would be very injurious to your
position for us to live in a poor way. You must expect your practice
to be lowered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Rosamond, it is not a question of choice. We have begun too
expensively. Peacock, you know, lived in a much smaller house than
this. It is my fault: I ought to have known better, and I deserve a
thrashing--if there were anybody who had a right to give it me--for
bringing you into the necessity of living in a poorer way than you have
been used to. But we married because we loved each other, I suppose.
And that may help us to pull along till things get better. Come, dear,
put down that work and come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was really in chill gloom about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) at that moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dreaded a
future without affection, and was determined to resist the oncoming of
division between them. Rosamond obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
knee, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) secret soul she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was utterly aloof from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). The poor
thing saw only that the world was not ordered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) liking, and
Lydgate was part of that world. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) waist with one hand
and laid the other gently on both of hers; for this rather abrupt man
had much tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners towards women, seeming to have
always present in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination the weakness of their frames and the
delicate poise of their health both in body and mind. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began
again to speak persuasively.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I find, now I look into things a little, Rosy, that it is wonderful
what an amount of money slips away in our housekeeping. I suppose the
servants are careless, and we have had a great many people coming. But
there must be many in our rank who manage with much less: they must do
with commoner things, I suppose, and look after the scraps. It seems,
money goes but a little way in these matters, for Wrench has everything
as plain as possible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) has a very large practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if you think of living as the Wrenches do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with a
little turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) neck. <div class="bookquote">``But I have heard you express your disgust at
that way of living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, they have bad taste in everything--they make economy look ugly.
We needn't do that. I only meant that they avoid expenses, although
Wrench has a capital practice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should not you have a good practice, Tertius? Mr. Peacock had.
You should be more careful not to offend people, and you should send
out medicines as the others do. I am sure you began well, and you got
several good houses. It cannot answer to be eccentric; you should
think what will be generally liked,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, in a decided little
tone of admonition.

<p/>Lydgate's anger rose: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was prepared to be indulgent towards feminine
weakness, but not towards feminine dictation. The shallowness of a
waternixie's soul may have a charm until she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) becomes didactic. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
controlled himself, and only said, with a touch of despotic firmness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I am to do in my practice, Rosy, it is for me to judge. That is
not the question between us. It is enough for you to know that our
income is likely to be a very narrow one--hardly four hundred, perhaps
less, for a long time to come, and we must try to re-arrange our lives
in accordance with that fact.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond was silent for a moment or two, looking before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and then
said, <div class="bookquote">``My uncle Bulstrode ought to allow you a salary for the time you
give to the Hospital: it is not right that you should work for nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was understood from the beginning that my services would be
gratuitous. That, again, need not enter into our discussion. I have
pointed out what is the only probability,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, impatiently.
Then checking himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went on more quietly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I see one resource which would free us from a good deal of the
present difficulty. I hear that young Ned Plymdale is going to be
married to Miss Sophy Toller. They are rich, and it is not often that
a good house is vacant in Middlemarch. I feel sure that they would be
glad to take this house from us with most of our furniture, and they
would be willing to pay handsomely for the lease. I can employ
Trumbull to speak to Plymdale about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's knee and walked slowly to the other end of
the room; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) turned round and walked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) it was evident
that the tears had come, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was biting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) under-lip and
clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands to keep herself from crying. Lydgate was
wretched--shaken with anger and yet feeling that it would be unmanly to
vent the anger just now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry, Rosamond; I know this is painful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, at least, when I had borne to send the plate back and have
that man taking an inventory of the furniture--I should have thought
_that_ would suffice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I explained it to you at the time, dear. That was only a security and
behind that security there is a debt. And that debt must be paid
within the next few months, else we shall have our furniture sold. If
young Plymdale will take our house and most of our furniture, we shall
be able to pay that debt, and some others too, and we shall be quit of
a place too expensive for us. We might take a smaller house: Trumbull,
I know, has a very decent one to let at thirty pounds a-year, and this
is ninety.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate uttered this speech in the curt hammering way with
which we usually try to nail down a vague mind to imperative facts.
Tears rolled silently down Rosamond's cheeks; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) just pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
handkerchief against them, and stood looking at the large vase on the
mantel-piece. It was a moment of more intense bitterness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
ever felt before. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, without hurry and with careful
emphasis--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never could have believed that you would like to act in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Like it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>burst out Lydgate, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pockets and stalking away from the hearth; <div class="bookquote">``it's not a
question of liking. Of course, I don't like it; it's the only thing I
can do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wheeled round there, and turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have thought there were many other means than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``Let us have a sale and leave Middlemarch altogether.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To do what? What is the use of my leaving my work in Middlemarch to
go where I have none? We should be just as penniless elsewhere as we
are here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate still more angrily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If we are to be in that position it will be entirely your own doing,
Tertius,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, turning round to speak with the fullest
conviction. <div class="bookquote">``You will not behave as you ought to do to your own
family. You offended Captain Lydgate. Sir Godwin was very kind to me
when we were at Quallingham, and I am sure if you showed proper regard
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) your affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) would do anything for you. But
rather than that, you like giving up our house and furniture to Mr. Ned
Plymdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>There was something like fierceness in Lydgate's eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) answered
with new violence, <div class="bookquote">``Well, then, if you will have it so, I do like it.
I admit that I like it better than making a fool of myself by going to
beg where it's of no use. Understand then, that it is what I _like to
do._''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a tone in the last sentence which was equivalent to the
clutch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) strong hand on Rosamond's delicate arm. But for all
that, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will was not a whit stronger than hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) immediately
walked out of the room in silence, but with an intense determination to
hinder what Lydgate liked to do.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went out of the house, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) blood cooled he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt that the
chief result of the discussion was a deposit of dread within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) at the
idea of opening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife in future subjects which might again urge
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to violent speech. It was as if a fracture in delicate crystal had
begun, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was afraid of any movement that might make it fatal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
marriage would be a mere piece of bitter irony if they could not go on
loving each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had long ago made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought
was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) negative character--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) want of sensibility, which showed
itself in disregard both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) specific wishes and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) general
aims. The first great disappointment had been borne: the tender
devotedness and docile adoration of the ideal wife must be renounced,
and life must be taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by
men who have lost their limbs. But the real wife had not only her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
claims, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had still a hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heart, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) intense
desire that the hold should remain strong. In marriage, the certainty,
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will never love me much,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>is easier to bear than the fear, <div class="bookquote">``I
shall love her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) no more.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Hence, after that outburst, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) inward effort
was entirely to excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and to blame the hard circumstances which
were partly his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tried that evening, by petting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), to heal
the wound he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had made in the morning, and it was not in Rosamond's
nature to be repellent or sulky; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) welcomed the signs that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and was under control. But this was something
quite distinct from loving _him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)_. Lydgate would not have chosen soon to
recur to the plan of parting with the house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was resolved to carry
it out, and say as little more about it as possible. But Rosamond
herself touched on it at breakfast by saying, mildly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you spoken to Trumbull yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall call on him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) as I go by this morning.
No time must be lost.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took Rosamond's question as a sign that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) inward opposition, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head caressingly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
got up to go away.

<p/>As soon as it was late enough to make a call, Rosamond went to Mrs.
Plymdale, Mr. Ned's mother, and entered with pretty congratulations
into the subject of the coming marriage. Mrs. Plymdale's maternal view
was, that Rosamond might possibly now have retrospective glimpses of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own folly; and feeling the advantages to be at present all on the
side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) son, was too kind a woman not to behave graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Ned is most happy, I must say. And Sophy Toller is all I could
desire in a daughter-in-law. Of course her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) father is able to do
something handsome for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>)--that is only what would be expected with a
brewery like his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And the connection is everything we should desire.
But that is not what I look at. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) is such a very nice girl--no airs,
no pretensions, though on a level with the first. I don't mean with
the titled aristocracy. I see very little good in people aiming out of
their own sphere. I mean that Sophy is equal to the best in the town,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) is contented with that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always thought her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter-in-law</b></font>) very agreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I look upon it as a reward for Ned, who never held his (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) head too high,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) should have got into the very best connection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs.
Plymdale, her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) native sharpness softened by a fervid sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) was
taking a correct view. <div class="bookquote">``And such particular people as the Tollers are,
they might have objected because some of our friends are not theirs.
It is well known that your aunt Bulstrode and I have been intimate from
our youth, and Mr. Plymdale has been always on Mr. Bulstrode's side.
And I myself prefer serious opinions. But the Tollers have welcomed
Ned all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) is a very deserving, well-principled young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond, with a neat air of patronage in return for Mrs. Plymdale's
wholesome corrections.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) has not the style of a captain in the army, or that sort of
carriage as if everybody was beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>), or that showy kind of
talking, and singing, and intellectual talent. But I am thankful he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>)
has not. It is a poor preparation both for here and Hereafter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh dear, yes; appearances have very little to do with happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``I think there is every prospect of their being a happy
couple. What house will they take?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, as for that, they must put up with what they can get. They have
been looking at the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's;
it belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) is putting it nicely in repair. I suppose
they are not likely to hear of a better. Indeed, I think Ned will
decide the matter to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think it is a nice house; I like St. Peter's Place.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is near the Church, and a genteel situation. But the windows
are narrow, and it is all ups and downs. You don't happen to know of
any other that would be at liberty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>)
round black eyes on Rosamond with the animation of a sudden thought in
them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no; I hear so little of those things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond had not foreseen that question and answer in setting out to
pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) visit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had simply meant to gather any information which
would help her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to avert the parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own house under
circumstances thoroughly disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). As to the untruth in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) no more reflected on it than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did on the untruth there
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) saying that appearances had very little to do with
happiness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) object, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was convinced, was thoroughly justifiable:
it was Lydgate whose intention was inexcusable; and there was a plan in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind which, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had carried it out fully, would prove how very
false a step it would have been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to have descended from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
position.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) returned home by Mr. Borthrop Trumbull's office, meaning to call
there. It was the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life that Rosamond had thought of
doing anything in the form of business, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt equal to the
occasion. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should be obliged to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) intensely
disliked, was an idea which turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) quiet tenacity into active
invention. Here was a case in which it could not be enough simply to
disobey and be serenely, placidly obstinate: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) must act according to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) judgment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said to herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) judgment was
right--<div class="bookquote">``indeed, if it had not been, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would not have wished to act on
it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Trumbull was in the back-room of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) office, and received Rosamond
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) finest manners, not only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) had much sensibility to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) charms, but because the good-natured fibre in him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) was stirred by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) certainty that Lydgate was in difficulties, and that this
uncommonly pretty woman--this young lady with the highest personal
attractions--was likely to feel the pinch of trouble--to find herself
involved in circumstances beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) control. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
the honor to take a seat, and stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) trimming and comporting
himself with an eager solicitude, which was chiefly benevolent.
Rosamond's first question was, whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband had called on Mr.
Trumbull that morning, to speak about disposing of their house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma'am, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did; he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) did so,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the good auctioneer, trying
to throw something soothing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) iteration. <div class="bookquote">``I was about to fulfil
his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) order, if possible, this afternoon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) wished me not to
procrastinate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I called to tell you not to go any further, Mr. Trumbull; and I beg of
you not to mention what has been said on the subject. Will you oblige
me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will, Mrs. Lydgate, certainly. Confidence is sacred with
me on business or any other topic. I am then to consider the
commission withdrawn?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, adjusting the long ends of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) blue cravat with both hands, and looking at Rosamond deferentially.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, if you please. I find that Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house--the
one in St. Peter's Place next to Mr. Hackbutt's. Mr. Lydgate would be
annoyed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) orders should be fulfilled uselessly. And besides
that, there are other circumstances which render the proposal
unnecessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, Mrs. Lydgate, very good. I am at your commands, whenever
you require any service of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Trumbull/Mr. Borthrop Trumbull/Trumbull</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trumbull, who felt pleasure in
conjecturing that some new resources had been opened. <div class="bookquote">``Rely on me, I
beg. The affair shall go no further.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>That evening Lydgate was a little comforted by observing that Rosamond
was more lively than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had usually been of late, and even seemed
interested in doing what would please him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) without being asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
thought, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will be happy and I can rub through, what does it all
signify? It is only a narrow swamp that we have to pass in a long
journey. If I can get my mind clear again, I shall do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was so much cheered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began to search for an account of
experiments which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had long ago meant to look up, and had neglected
out of that creeping self-despair which comes in the train of petty
anxieties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt again some of the old delightful absorption in a
far-reaching inquiry, while Rosamond played the quiet music which was
as helpful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meditation as the plash of an oar on the evening
lake. It was rather late; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had pushed away all the books, and was
looking at the fire with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands clasped behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head in
forgetfulness of everything except the construction of a new
controlling experiment, when Rosamond, who had left the piano and was
leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chair watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ned Plymdale has taken a house already.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate, startled and jarred, looked up in silence for a moment, like a
man who has been disturbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sleep. Then flushing with an
unpleasant consciousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) asked--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I called at Mrs. Plymdale's this morning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) had
taken the house in St. Peter's Place, next to Mr. Hackbutt's.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hands from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head and pressed
them against the hair which was hanging, as it was apt to do, in a mass
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) forehead, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) elbows on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knees. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
feeling bitter disappointment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had opened a door out of a
suffocating place and had found it walled up; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) also felt sure
that Rosamond was pleased with the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) disappointment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
preferred not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and not speaking, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had got over
the first spasm of vexation. After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bitterness,
what can a woman care about so much as house and furniture? a husband
without them is an absurdity. When he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looked up and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hair
aside, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dark eyes had a miserable blank non-expectance of sympathy
in them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only said, coolly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps some one else may turn up. I told Trumbull to be on the
look-out if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) failed with Plymdale.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond made no remark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) trusted to the chance that nothing more
would pass between her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband and the auctioneer until some issue
should have justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) interference; at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had hindered
the event which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) immediately dreaded. After a pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much money is it that those disagreeable people want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What disagreeable people?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Those who took the list--and the others. I mean, how much money would
satisfy them so that you need not be troubled any more?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) for a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were looking for symptoms,
and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I could have got six hundred from Plymdale for
furniture and as premium, I might have managed. I could have paid off
Dover, and given enough on account to the others to make them wait
patiently, if we contracted our expenses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I mean how much should you want if we stayed in this house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More than I am likely to get anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with rather a
grating sarcasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone. It angered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to perceive that
Rosamond's mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of
facing possible efforts.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you not mention the sum?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with a mild
indication that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not like his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) manners.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate in a guessing tone, <div class="bookquote">``it would take at least a
thousand to set me at ease. But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) added, incisively, <div class="bookquote">``I have to
consider what I shall do without it, not with it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond said no more.

<p/>But the next day she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) carried out her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) plan of writing to Sir Godwin
Lydgate. Since the Captain's visit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had received a letter from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and also one from Mrs. Mengan, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) married sister, condoling with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) on the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) baby, and expressing vaguely the hope that they
should see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) again at Quallingham. Lydgate had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) that this
politeness meant nothing; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) was secretly convinced that any
backwardness in Lydgate's family towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cold and
contemptuous behavior, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) had answered the letters in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mengan</b></font>) most
charming manner, feeling some confidence that a specific invitation
would follow. But there had been total silence. The Captain evidently
was not a great penman, and Rosamond reflected that the sisters might
have been abroad. However, the season was come for thinking of friends
at home, and at any rate Sir Godwin, who had chucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) under the
chin, and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to be like the celebrated beauty, Mrs. Croly,
who had made a conquest of him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) in 1790, would be touched by any appeal
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and would find it pleasant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sake to behave as he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) ought
to do towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) nephew. Rosamond was naively convinced of what an
old gentleman ought to do to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from suffering annoyance. And
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wrote what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) considered the most judicious letter possible--one
which would strike Sir Godwin as a proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) excellent sense--pointing
out how desirable it was that Tertius should quit such a place
as Middlemarch for one more fitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) talents, how the unpleasant
character of the inhabitants had hindered his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) professional success, and
how in consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) was in money difficulties, from which it would
require a thousand pounds thoroughly to extricate him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not say
that Tertius was unaware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) intention to write; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had the
idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) supposed sanction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) letter would be in accordance
with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did say of his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) great regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) uncle Godwin as the
relative who had always been his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) best friend. Such was the force of
Poor Rosamond's tactics now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) applied them to affairs.

<p/>This had happened before the party on New Year's Day, and no answer had
yet come from Sir Godwin. But on the morning of that day Lydgate had
to learn that Rosamond had revoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) order to Borthrop Trumbull.
Feeling it necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should be gradually accustomed to the
idea of their quitting the house in Lowick Gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
reluctance to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) again on the subject, and when they were
breakfasting said--

<p/>``I shall try to see Trumbull this morning, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) to advertise
the house in the ``Pioneer' and the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If the thing were
advertised, some one might be inclined to take it who would not
otherwise have thought of a change. In these country places many
people go on in their old houses when their families are too large for
them, for want of knowing where they can find another. And Trumbull
seems to have got no bite at all.''

<p/>Rosamond knew that the inevitable moment was come. <div class="bookquote">``I ordered Trumbull
not to inquire further,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, with a careful calmness which was
evidently defensive.

<p/>Lydgate stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in mute amazement. Only half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had been fastening up her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) plaits for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and talking the <div class="bookquote">``little
language''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>of affection, which Rosamond, though not returning it,
accepted as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been a serene and lovely image, now and then
miraculously dimpling towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) votary. With such fibres still astir
in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), the shock he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) received could not at once be distinctly anger; it
was confused pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) laid down the knife and fork with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
carving, and throwing himself back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair, said at last, with a
cool irony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I ask when and why you did so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I knew that the Plymdales had taken a house, I called to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>)
not to mention ours to them; and at the same time I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) not to let
the affair go on any further. I knew that it would be very injurious
to you if it were known that you wished to part with your house and
furniture, and I had a very strong objection to it. I think that was
reason enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was of no consequence then that I had told you imperative reasons
of another kind; of no consequence that I had come to a different
conclusion, and given an order accordingly?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, bitingly,
the thunder and lightning gathering about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brow and eyes.

<p/>The effect of any one's anger on Rosamond had always been to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
shrink in cold dislike, and to become all the more calmly correct, in
the conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was not the person to misbehave whatever others
might do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) replied--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I had a perfect right to speak on a subject which concerns me
at least as much as you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly--you had a right to speak, but only to me. You had no right
to contradict my orders secretly, and treat me as if I were a fool,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, in the same tone as before. Then with some added scorn,
<div class="bookquote">``Is it possible to make you understand what the consequences will be?
Is it of any use for me to tell you again why we must try to part with
the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not necessary for you to tell me again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, in a
voice that fell and trickled like cold water-drops. <div class="bookquote">``I remembered what
you said. You spoke just as violently as you do now. But that does
not alter my opinion that you ought to try every other means rather
than take a step which is so painful to me. And as to advertising the
house, I think it would be perfectly degrading to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And suppose I disregard your opinion as you disregard mine?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can do so, of course. But I think you ought to have told me
before we were married that you would place me in the worst position,
rather than give up your own will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate did not speak, but tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head on one side, and twitched
the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mouth in despair. Rosamond, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), rose and set his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cup of coffee before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took
no notice of it, and went on with an inward drama and argument,
occasionally moving in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) seat, resting one arm on the table, and
rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hand against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hair. There was a conflux of emotions and
thoughts in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) either give thorough way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
anger or persevere with simple rigidity of resolve. Rosamond took
advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When we were married everyone felt that your position was very high.
I could not have imagined then that you would want to sell our
furniture, and take a house in Bride Street, where the rooms are like
cages. If we are to live in that way let us at least leave
Middlemarch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These would be very strong considerations,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, half
ironically--still there was a withered paleness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) coffee, and did not drink--<div class="bookquote">``these would be very strong
considerations if I did not happen to be in debt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Many persons must have been in debt in the same way, but if they are
respectable, people trust them. I am sure I have heard papa say that
the Torbits were in debt, and they went on very well. It cannot be
good to act rashly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, with serene wisdom.

<p/>Lydgate sat paralyzed by opposing impulses: since no reasoning he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could
apply to Rosamond seemed likely to conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) assent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wanted to
smash and grind some object on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could at least produce an
impression, or else to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) brutally that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was master, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
must obey. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not only dreaded the effect of such extremities on
their mutual life--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had a growing dread of Rosamond's quiet elusive
obstinacy, which would not allow any assertion of power to be final;
and again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in a spot of keenest feeling by implying
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been deluded with a false vision of happiness in marrying
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). As to saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was master, it was not the fact. The very
resolution to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had wrought himself by dint of logic and
honorable pride was beginning to relax under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) torpedo contact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
swallowed half his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cup of coffee, and then rose to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I may at least request that you will not go to Trumbull at
present--until it has been seen that there are no other means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said
Rosamond. Although she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was not subject to much fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt it safer
not to betray that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had written to Sir Godwin. <div class="bookquote">``Promise me that you
will not go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Trumbull</b></font>) for a few weeks, or without telling me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate gave a short laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I think it is I who should exact a
promise that you will do nothing without telling me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, turning
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes sharply upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and then moving to the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember that we are going to dine at papa's,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should turn and make a more thorough concession to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) only said <div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>impatiently, and went away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) held it to
be very odious in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not think the painful propositions he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had had to make to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) were enough, without showing so unpleasant a
temper. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put the moderate request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would defer
going to Trumbull again, it was cruel in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) of what
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meant to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) having acted in every way for
the best; and each grating or angry speech of Lydgate's served only as
an addition to the register of offences in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind. Poor Rosamond for
months had begun to associate her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband with feelings of
disappointment, and the terribly inflexible relation of marriage had
lost its charm of encouraging delightful dreams. It had freed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from
the disagreeables of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father's house, but it had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
everything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had wished and hoped. The Lydgate with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had been in love had been a group of airy conditions for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), most of
which had disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day
details which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not
floated through with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. The
habits of Lydgate's profession, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) home preoccupation with scientific
subjects, which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) almost like a morbid vampire's taste, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
peculiar views of things which had never entered into the dialogue of
courtship--all these continually alienating influences, even without
the fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) having placed himself at a disadvantage in the town,
and without that first shock of revelation about Dover's debt, would
have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) presence dull to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). There was another presence which
ever since the early days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) marriage, until four months ago, had
been an agreeable excitement, but that was gone: Rosamond would not
confess to herself how much the consequent blank had to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
utter ennui; and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) -LRB-perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was right-RRB- that an
invitation to Quallingham, and an opening for Lydgate to settle
elsewhere than in Middlemarch--in London, or somewhere likely to be
free from unpleasantness--would satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) quite well, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
indifferent to the absence of Will Ladislaw, towards whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt some
resentment for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) exaltation of Mrs. Casaubon.

<p/>That was the state of things with Lydgate and Rosamond on the New
Year's Day when they dined at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) looking mildly neutral
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ill-tempered behavior at breakfast,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) carrying a much deeper effect from the inward conflict in which
that morning scene was only one of many epochs. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flushed effort
while talking to Mr. Farebrother--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) effort after the cynical pretence
that all ways of getting money are essentially the same, and that
chance has an empire which reduces choice to a fool's illusion--was but
the symptom of a wavering resolve, a benumbed response to the old
stimuli of enthusiasm.

<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to do? He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) saw even more keenly than Rosamond did the
dreariness of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into the small house in Bride Street, where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have scanty furniture around her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and discontent within: a
life of privation and life with Rosamond were two images which had
become more and more irreconcilable ever since the threat of privation
had disclosed itself. But even if his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) resolves had forced the two
images into combination, the useful preliminaries to that hard change
were not visibly within reach. And though he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had not given the promise
which his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife had asked for, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did not go again to Trumbull. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) even
began to think of taking a rapid journey to the North and seeing Sir
Godwin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) had once believed that nothing would urge him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) into making
an application for money to his (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) uncle, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) had not then known the
full pressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) could not
depend on the effect of a letter; it was only in an interview, however
disagreeable this might be to himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) could give a thorough
explanation and could test the effectiveness of kinship. No sooner had
Lydgate begun to represent this step to himself as the easiest than
there was a reaction of anger that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) who had long ago determined
to live aloof from such abject calculations, such self-interested
anxiety about the inclinations and the pockets of men with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
been proud to have no aims in common--should have fallen not simply to
their level, but to the level of soliciting them.



<p/>CHAPTER LXV.

<p/>``One of us two must bowen douteless,
And, sith a man is more reasonable
Than woman is, ye -LSB-men-RSB- moste be suffrable.
--CHAUCER: Canterbury Tales.


<p/>The bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even
over the present quickening in the general pace of things: what wonder
then that in 1832 old Sir Godwin Lydgate was slow to write a letter
which was of consequence to others rather than to himself? Nearly
three weeks of the new year were gone, and Rosamond, awaiting an answer
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) winning appeal, was every day disappointed. Lydgate, in total
ignorance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) expectations, was seeing the bills come in, and
feeling that Dover's use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) advantage over other creditors was
imminent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never mentioned to Rosamond his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brooding purpose of
going to Quallingham: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not want to admit what would appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
a concession to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wishes after indignant refusal, until the last
moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was really expecting to set off soon. A slice of the
railway would enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to manage the whole journey and back in four
days.

<p/>But one morning after Lydgate had gone out, a letter came addressed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), which Rosamond saw clearly to be from Sir Godwin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was full of
hope. Perhaps there might be a particular note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) enclosed; but
Lydgate was naturally addressed on the question of money or other aid,
and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was written to, nay, the very delay in writing at
all, seemed to certify that the answer was thoroughly compliant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
was too much excited by these thoughts to do anything but light
stitching in a warm corner of the dining-room, with the outside of this
momentous letter lying on the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). About twelve she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband's step in the passage, and tripping to open the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lightest tones, <div class="bookquote">``Tertius, come in here--here is a letter
for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, not taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat, but just turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) round
within his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm to walk towards the spot where the letter lay. <div class="bookquote">``My
uncle Godwin!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) exclaimed, while Rosamond reseated herself, and
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opened the letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to be
surprised.

<p/>While Lydgate's eyes glanced rapidly over the brief letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
face, usually of a pale brown, taking on a dry whiteness; with nostrils
and lips quivering he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tossed down the letter before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and said
violently--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be impossible to endure life with you, if you will always be
acting secretly--acting in opposition to me and hiding your actions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) checked his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) speech and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)--then wheeled round
and walked about, sat down, and got up again restlessly, grasping hard
the objects deep down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was afraid of saying
something irremediably cruel.

<p/>Rosamond too had changed color as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) read. The letter ran in this
way:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``DEAR TERTIUS,--Don't set your wife to write to me when you have
anything to ask. It is a roundabout wheedling sort of thing which I
should not have credited you with. I never choose to write to a woman
on matters of business. As to my supplying you with a thousand pounds,
or only half that sum, I can do nothing of the sort. My own family
drains me to the last penny. With two younger sons and three
daughters, I am not likely to have cash to spare. You seem to have got
through your own money pretty quickly, and to have made a mess where
you are; the sooner you go somewhere else the better. But I have
nothing to do with men of your profession, and can't help you there. I
did the best I could for you as guardian, and let you have your own way
in taking to medicine. You might have gone into the army or the
Church. Your money would have held out for that, and there would have
been a surer ladder before you. Your uncle Charles has had a grudge
against you for not going into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) profession, but not I. I have always
wished you well, but you must consider yourself on your own legs
entirely now.

<p/>Your affectionate uncle,
GODWIN LYDGATE.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>When Rosamond had finished reading the letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sat quite still, with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands folded before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), restraining any show of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) keen
disappointment, and intrenching herself in quiet passivity under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
husband's wrath. Lydgate paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) movements, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) again,
and said, with biting severity--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will this be enough to convince you of the harm you may do by secret
meddling? Have you sense enough to recognize now your incompetence to
judge and act for me--to interfere with your ignorance in affairs which
it belongs to me to decide on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>The words were hard; but this was not the first time that Lydgate had
been frustrated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had nearly resolved on going to Quallingham. It would have cost me
pain enough to do it, yet it might have been of some use. But it has
been of no use for me to think of anything. You have always been
counteracting me secretly. You delude me with a false assent, and then
I am at the mercy of your devices. If you mean to resist every wish I
express, say so and defy me. I shall at least know what I am doing
then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It is a terrible moment in young lives when the closeness of love's
bond has turned to this power of galling. In spite of Rosamond's
self-control a tear fell silently and rolled over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) still
said nothing; but under that quietude was hidden an intense effect: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
was in such entire disgust with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). Sir Godwin's rudeness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and utter want of
feeling ranged him (<font color='blue'><b>Godwin</b></font>) with Dover and all other creditors--disagreeable
people who only thought of themselves, and did not mind how annoying
they were to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). Even her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father was unkind, and might have done more
for them. In fact there was but one person in Rosamond's world whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not regard as blameworthy, and that was the graceful creature
with blond plaits and with little hands crossed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), who had
never expressed herself unbecomingly, and had always acted for the
best--the best naturally being what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) best liked.

<p/>Lydgate pausing and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) began to feel that half-maddening
sense of helplessness which comes over passionate people when their
passion is met by an innocent-looking silence whose meek victimized air
seems to put them in the wrong, and at last infects even the justest
indignation with a doubt of its justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) needed to recover the full
sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in the right by moderating his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) words.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you not see, Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began again, trying to be simply grave
and not bitter, <div class="bookquote">``that nothing can be so fatal as a want of openness and
confidence between us? It has happened again and again that I have
expressed a decided wish, and you have seemed to assent, yet after that
you have secretly disobeyed my wish. In that way I can never know what
I have to trust to. There would be some hope for us if you would admit
this. Am I such an unreasonable, furious brute? Why should you not be
open with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Still silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you only say that you have been mistaken, and that I may depend
on your not acting secretly in future?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, urgently, but
with something of request in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone which Rosamond was quick to
perceive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke with coolness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot possibly make admissions or promises in answer to such words
as you have used towards me. I have not been accustomed to language of
that kind. You have spoken of my `secret meddling,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and my
`interfering ignorance,<div class="bookquote">'' and my `false assent.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have never expressed
myself in that way to you, and I think that you ought to apologize.
You spoke of its being impossible to live with me. Certainly you have
not made my life pleasant to me of late. I think it was to be expected
that I should try to avert some of the hardships which our marriage has
brought on me.'' Another tear fell as Rosamond ceased speaking, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
pressed it away as quietly as the first.

<p/>Lydgate flung himself into a chair, feeling checkmated. What place was
there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind for a remonstrance to lodge in? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hat, flung an arm over the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair, and looked down for some
moments without speaking. Rosamond had the double purchase over him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) of
insensibility to the point of justice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reproach, and of
sensibility to the undeniable hardships now present in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) married
life. Although her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) duplicity in the affair of the house had exceeded
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew, and had really hindered the Plymdales from knowing of it,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had no consciousness that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) action could rightly be called false.
We are not obliged to identify our own acts according to a strict
classification, any more than the materials of our grocery and clothes.
Rosamond felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was aggrieved, and that this was what Lydgate
had to recognize.

<p/>As for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), the need of accommodating himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) nature, which was
inflexible in proportion to its negations, held him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as with pincers.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had begun to have an alarmed foresight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) irrevocable loss of
love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and the consequent dreariness of their life. The ready
fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) emotions made this dread alternate quickly with the
first violent movements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger. It would assuredly have been a
vain boast in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) master.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not made my life pleasant to me of late'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``the hardships
which our marriage has brought on me'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--these words were stinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
imagination as a pain makes an exaggerated dream. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were not only
to sink from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) highest resolve, but to sink into the hideous
fettering of domestic hate?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosamond,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with a melancholy look,
<div class="bookquote">``you should allow for a man's words when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is disappointed and
provoked. You and I cannot have opposite interests. I cannot part my
happiness from yours. If I am angry with you, it is that you seem not
to see how any concealment divides us. How could I wish to make
anything hard to you either by my words or conduct? When I hurt you, I
hurt part of my own life. I should never be angry with you if you
would be quite open with me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have only wished to prevent you from hurrying us into wretchedness
without any necessity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, the tears coming again from a
softened feeling now that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband had softened. <div class="bookquote">``It is so very
hard to be disgraced here among all the people we know, and to live in
such a miserable way. I wish I had died with the baby.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spoke and wept with that gentleness which makes such words and
tears omnipotent over a loving-hearted man. Lydgate drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair
near to hers and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) delicate head against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cheek with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
powerful tender hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) only caressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not say anything;
for what was there to say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not promise to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from the
dreaded wretchedness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could see no sure means of doing so. When
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to go out again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) told himself that it was ten times
harder for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) than for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had a life away from home, and constant
appeals to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) activity on behalf of others. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wished to excuse
everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could--but it was inevitable that in that
excusing mood he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) were an animal of
another and feebler species. Nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER LXVI.

<p/><div class="bookquote">''`Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Measure for Measure.


<p/>Lydgate certainly had good reason to reflect on the service his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
practice did him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in counteracting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) personal cares. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no longer
free energy enough for spontaneous research and speculative thinking,
but by the bedside of patients, the direct external calls on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
judgment and sympathies brought the added impulse needed to draw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
out of himself. It was not simply that beneficent harness of routine
which enables silly men to live respectably and unhappy men to live
calmly--it was a perpetual claim on the immediate fresh application of
thought, and on the consideration of another's need and trial. Many of
us looking back through life would say that the kindest man we have
ever known has been a medical man, or perhaps that surgeon whose fine
tact, directed by deeply informed perception, has come to us in our
need with a more sublime beneficence than that of miracle-workers. Some
of that twice-blessed mercy was always with Lydgate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work at the
Hospital or in private houses, serving better than any opiate to quiet
and sustain him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anxieties and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sense of mental degeneracy.

<p/>Mr. Farebrother's suspicion as to the opiate was true, however. Under
the first galling pressure of foreseen difficulties, and the first
perception that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) marriage, if it were not to be a yoked loneliness,
must be a state of effort to go on loving without too much care about
being loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had once or twice tried a dose of opium. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no
hereditary constitutional craving after such transient escapes from the
hauntings of misery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was strong, could drink a great deal of wine,
but did not care about it; and when the men round him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were drinking
spirits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took sugar and water, having a contemptuous pity even for
the earliest stages of excitement from drink. It was the same with
gambling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had looked on at a great deal of gambling in Paris,
watching it as if it had been a disease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was no more tempted by
such winning than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was by drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had said to himself that the
only winning he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cared for must be attained by a conscious process of
high, difficult combination tending towards a beneficent result. The
power he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) longed for could not be represented by agitated fingers
clutching a heap of coin, or by the half-barbarous, half-idiotic
triumph in the eyes of a man who sweeps within his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms the ventures of
twenty chapfallen companions.

<p/>But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried opium, so his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought now began to turn upon
gambling--not with appetite for its excitement, but with a sort of
wistful inward gaze after that easy way of getting money, which implied
no asking and brought no responsibility. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in London or
Paris at that time, it is probable that such thoughts, seconded by
opportunity, would have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into a gambling-house, no longer to
watch the gamblers, but to watch with them in kindred eagerness.
Repugnance would have been surmounted by the immense need to win, if
chance would be kind enough to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). An incident which happened not
very long after that airy notion of getting aid from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle had been
excluded, was a strong sign of the effect that might have followed any
extant opportunity of gambling.

<p/>The billiard-room at the Green Dragon was the constant resort of a
certain set, most of whom, like our acquaintance Mr. Bambridge, were
regarded as men of pleasure. It was here that poor Fred Vincy had made
part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) memorable debt, having lost money in betting, and been
obliged to borrow of that gay companion. It was generally known in
Middlemarch that a good deal of money was lost and won in this way; and
the consequent repute of the Green Dragon as a place of dissipation
naturally heightened in some quarters the temptation to go there.
Probably its regular visitants, like the initiates of freemasonry,
wished that there were something a little more tremendous to keep to
themselves concerning it; but they were not a closed community, and
many decent seniors as well as juniors occasionally turned into the
billiard-room to see what was going on. Lydgate, who had the muscular
aptitude for billiards, and was fond of the game, had once or twice in
the early days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arrival in Middlemarch taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) turn with the
cue at the Green Dragon; but afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had no leisure for the game,
and no inclination for the socialities there. One evening, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>)
had occasion to seek Mr. Bambridge at that resort. The horsedealer had
engaged to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) a customer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) remaining good horse, for which
Lydgate had determined to substitute a cheap hack, hoping by this
reduction of style to get perhaps twenty pounds; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cared now for
every small sum, as a help towards feeding the patience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
tradesmen. To run up to the billiard-room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was passing, would
save time.

<p/>Mr. Bambridge was not yet come, but would be sure to arrive by-and-by,
said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) friend Mr. Horrock; and Lydgate stayed, playing a game for the
sake of passing the time. That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) had the peculiar light in
the eyes and the unusual vivacity which had been once noticed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Horrock</b></font>) by
Mr. Farebrother. The exceptional fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) presence was much noticed
in the room, where there was a good deal of Middlemarch company; and
several lookers-on, as well as some of the players, were betting with
animation. Lydgate was playing well, and felt confident; the bets were
dropping round him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and with a swift glancing thought of the probable
gain which might double the sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was saving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began
to bet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own play, and won again and again. Mr. Bambridge had
come in, but Lydgate did not notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not only excited with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) play, but visions were gleaming on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) of going the next day to
Brassing, where there was gambling on a grander scale to be had, and
where, by one powerful snatch at the devil's bait, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might carry it
off without the hook, and buy his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) rescue from his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) daily solicitings.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was still winning when two new visitors entered. One of them was a
young Hawley, just come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) law studies in town, and the other was
Fred Vincy, who had spent several evenings of late at this old haunt of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>). Young Hawley, an accomplished billiard-player, brought a cool
fresh hand to the cue. But Fred Vincy, startled at seeing Lydgate, and
astonished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) betting with an excited air, stood aside, and
kept out of the circle round the table.

<p/>Fred had been rewarding resolution by a little laxity of late. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had
been working heartily for six months at all outdoor occupations under
Mr. Garth, and by dint of severe practice had nearly mastered the
defects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) handwriting, this practice being, perhaps, a little the
less severe that it was often carried on in the evening at Mr. Garth's
under the eyes of Mary. But the last fortnight Mary had been staying
at Lowick Parsonage with the ladies there, during Mr. Farebrother's
residence in Middlemarch, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was carrying out some parochial
plans; and Fred, not seeing anything more agreeable to do, had turned
into the Green Dragon, partly to play at billiards, partly to taste the
old flavor of discourse about horses, sport, and things in general,
considered from a point of view which was not strenuously correct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>)
had not been out hunting once this season, had had no horse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) own
to ride, and had gone from place to place chiefly with Mr. Garth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
gig, or on the sober cob which Mr. Garth could lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>). It was a
little too bad, Fred began to think, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should be kept in the
traces with more severity than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had been a clergyman. <div class="bookquote">``I will
tell you what, Mistress Mary--it will be rather harder work to learn
surveying and drawing plans than it would have been to write sermons,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had said, wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) to appreciate what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) went through for her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
sake; <div class="bookquote">``and as to Hercules and Theseus, they were nothing to me. They
had sport, and never learned to write a bookkeeping hand.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now,
Mary being out of the way for a little while, Fred, like any other
strong dog who cannot slip his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) collar, had pulled up the staple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
chain and made a small escape, not of course meaning to go fast or far.
There could be no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should not play at billiards, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
was determined not to bet. As to money just now, Fred had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind
the heroic project of saving almost all of the eighty pounds that Mr.
Garth offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), and returning it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could easily do by giving
up all futile money-spending, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had a superfluous stock of
clothes, and no expense in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) board. In that way he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could, in one
year, go a good way towards repaying the ninety pounds of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) had
deprived Mrs. Garth, unhappily at a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) needed that sum more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) did now. Nevertheless, it must be acknowledged that on this
evening, which was the fifth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) recent visits to the billiard-room,
Fred had, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pocket, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind, the ten pounds which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
meant to reserve for himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) half-year's salary -LRB-having before
him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) the pleasure of carrying thirty to Mrs. Garth when Mary was likely
to be come home again-RRB---he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had those ten pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mind as a fund
from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might risk something, if there were a chance of a good
bet. Why? Well, when sovereigns were flying about, why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
catch a few? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) would never go far along that road again; but a man
likes to assure himself, and men of pleasure generally, what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could
do in the way of mischief if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) abstains from
making himself ill, or beggaring himself, or talking with the utmost
looseness which the narrow limits of human capacity will allow, it is
not because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a spooney. Fred did not enter into formal reasons,
which are a very artificial, inexact way of representing the tingling
returns of old habit, and the caprices of young blood: but there was
lurking in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a prophetic sense that evening, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) began to
play he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should also begin to bet--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should enjoy some
punch-drinking, and in general prepare himself for feeling <div class="bookquote">``rather
seedy''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in the morning. It is in such indefinable movements that action
often begins.

<p/>But the last thing likely to have entered Fred's expectation was that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) should see his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) brother-in-law Lydgate--of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had never quite
dropped the old opinion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was a prig, and tremendously conscious
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) superiority--looking excited and betting, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) himself
might have done. Fred felt a shock greater than he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could quite account
for by the vague knowledge that Lydgate was in debt, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
father had refused to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own inclination to enter into
the play was suddenly checked. It was a strange reversal of attitudes:
Fred's blond face and blue eyes, usually bright and careless, ready to
give attention to anything that held out a promise of amusement,
looking involuntarily grave and almost embarrassed as if by the sight
of something unfitting; while Lydgate, who had habitually an air of
self-possessed strength, and a certain meditativeness that seemed to
lie behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) most observant attention, was acting, watching, speaking
with that excited narrow consciousness which reminds one of an animal
with fierce eyes and retractile claws.

<p/>Lydgate, by betting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own strokes, had won sixteen pounds; but
young Hawley's arrival had changed the poise of things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) made
first-rate strokes himself, and began to bet against Lydgate's strokes,
the strain of whose nerves was thus changed from simple confidence in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own movements to defying another person's doubt in them. The
defiance was more exciting than the confidence, but it was less sure.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) continued to bet on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own play, but began often to fail. Still he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
went on, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind was as utterly narrowed into that precipitous
crevice of play as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been the most ignorant lounger there.
Fred observed that Lydgate was losing fast, and found himself in the
new situation of puzzling his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brains to think of some device by which,
without being offensive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could withdraw Lydgate's attention, and
perhaps suggest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a reason for quitting the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw that
others were observing Lydgate's strange unlikeness to himself, and it
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that merely to touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) elbow and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) aside for a
moment might rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) absorption. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could think of nothing
cleverer than the daring improbability of saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wanted to see
Rosy, and wished to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) were at home this evening; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
going desperately to carry out this weak device, when a waiter came up
to him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) with a message, saying that Mr. Farebrother was below, and
begged to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>).

<p/>Fred was surprised, not quite comfortably, but sending word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
would be down immediately, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) went with a new impulse up to Lydgate,
said, <div class="bookquote">``Can I speak to you a moment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) aside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Farebrother has just sent up a message to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) wants to speak
to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is below. I thought you might like to know he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) was there, if
you had anything to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred had simply snatched up this pretext for speaking, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could
not say, <div class="bookquote">``You are losing confoundedly, and are making everybody stare
at you; you had better come away.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But inspiration could hardly have
served him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) better. Lydgate had not before seen that Fred was present,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) sudden appearance with an announcement of Mr. Farebrother had
the effect of a sharp concussion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate; <div class="bookquote">``I have nothing particular to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>).
But--the game is up--I must be going--I came in just to see Bambridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bambridge is over there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>) is making a row--I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Theseus</b></font>)'s
ready for business. Come down with me to Farebrother. I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) is
going to blow me up, and you will shield me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, with some
adroitness.

<p/>Lydgate felt shame, but could not bear to act as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt it, by
refusing to see Mr. Farebrother; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) went down. They merely shook
hands, however, and spoke of the frost; and when all three had turned
into the street, the Vicar seemed quite willing to say good-by to
Lydgate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) present purpose was clearly to talk with Fred alone, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, kindly, <div class="bookquote">``I disturbed you, young gentleman, because I have some
pressing business with you. Walk with me to St. Botolph's, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a fine night, the sky thick with stars, and Mr. Farebrother
proposed that they should make a circuit to the old church by the
London road. The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) said was--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought Lydgate never went to the Green Dragon?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So did I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred. <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went to see Bambridge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was not playing, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Fred had not meant to tell this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was obliged now to say, <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was. But I suppose it was an accidental thing. I have never seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) there before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been going often yourself, then, lately?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, about five or six times.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you had some good reason for giving up the habit of going
there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. You know all about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred, not liking to be catechised
in this way. <div class="bookquote">``I made a clean breast to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that gives me a warrant to speak about the matter now. It
is understood between us, is it not?--that we are on a footing of open
friendship: I have listened to you, and you will be willing to listen
to me. I may take my turn in talking a little about myself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am under the deepest obligation to you, Mr. Farebrother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>said Fred,
in a state of uncomfortable surmise.

<p/>``I will not affect to deny that you are under some obligation to me.
But I am going to confess to you, Fred, that I have been tempted to
reverse all that by keeping silence with you just now. When somebody
said to me, <div class="bookquote">``Young Vincy has taken to being at the billiard-table every
night again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) won't bear the curb long;' I was tempted to do the
opposite of what I am doing--to hold my tongue and wait while you went
down the ladder again, betting first and then--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not made any bets,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Fred, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to hear it. But I say, my prompting was to look on and see you
take the wrong turning, wear out Garth's patience, and lose the best
opportunity of your life--the opportunity which you made some rather
difficult effort to secure. You can guess the feeling which raised
that temptation in me--I am sure you know it. I am sure you know that
the satisfaction of your affections stands in the way of mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause. Mr. Farebrother seemed to wait for a recognition of
the fact; and the emotion perceptible in the tones of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) fine voice
gave solemnity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) words. But no feeling could quell Fred's alarm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I could not be expected to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, after a moment's
hesitation: it was not a case for any pretence of generosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly not, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) affection met yours. But relations of this
sort, even when they are of long standing, are always liable to change.
I can easily conceive that you might act in a way to loosen the tie she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
feels towards you--it must be remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) is only conditionally
bound to you--and that in that case, another man, who may flatter
himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) regard, might succeed in winning that
firm place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) love as well as respect which you had let slip. I
can easily conceive such a result,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Farebrother,
emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``There is a companionship of ready sympathy, which might
get the advantage even over the longest associations.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>It seemed to
Fred that if Mr. Farebrother had had a beak and talons instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
very capable tongue, his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) mode of attack could hardly be more cruel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
had a horrible conviction that behind all this hypothetic statement
there was a knowledge of some actual change in Mary's feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course I know it might easily be all up with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) said, in a
troubled voice. <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) is beginning to compare--''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) broke off, not
liking to betray all he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) felt, and then said, by the help of a little
bitterness, <div class="bookquote">``But I thought you were friendly to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``So I am; that is why we are here. But I have had a strong disposition
to be otherwise. I have said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``If there is a likelihood of
that youngster doing himself harm, why should you interfere? Aren't
you worth as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) is, and don't your sixteen years over and above
his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>), in which you have gone rather hungry, give you more right to
satisfaction than he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) has? If there's a chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) going to the
dogs, let him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>)--perhaps you could nohow hinder it--and do you take the
benefit.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause, in which Fred was seized by a most uncomfortable
chill. What was coming next? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) dreaded to hear that something had
been said to Mary--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) were listening to a threat rather
than a warning. When the Vicar began again there was a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
tone like the encouraging transition to a major key.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I had once meant better than that, and I am come back to my old
intention. I thought that I could hardly _secure myself_ in it better,
Fred, than by telling you just what had gone on in me. And now, do you
understand me? I want you to make the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life and your
own, and if there is any chance that a word of warning from me may turn
aside any risk to the contrary--well, I have uttered it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a drop in the Vicar's voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) spoke the last words. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
paused--they were standing on a patch of green where the road diverged
towards St. Botolph's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) hand, as if to imply that the
conversation was closed. Fred was moved quite newly. Some one highly
susceptible to the contemplation of a fine act has said, that it
produces a sort of regenerating shudder through the frame, and makes
one feel ready to begin a new life. A good degree of that effect was
just then present in Fred Vincy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will try to be worthy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) said, breaking off before he (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) could say
<div class="bookquote">``of you as well as of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And meanwhile Mr. Farebrother had gathered
the impulse to say something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must not imagine that I believe there is at present any decline in
her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) preference of you, Fred. Set your heart at rest, that if you keep
right, other things will keep right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall never forget what you have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred answered. <div class="bookquote">``I can't say
anything that seems worth saying--only I will try that your goodness
shall not be thrown away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's enough. Good-by, and God bless you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In that way they parted. But both of them walked about a long while
before they went out of the starlight. Much of Fred's rumination might
be summed up in the words, <div class="bookquote">``It certainly would have been a fine thing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to marry Farebrother--but if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) loves me best and I am a good
husband?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps Mr. Farebrother's might be concentrated into a single shrug and
one little speech. <div class="bookquote">``To think of the part one little woman can play in
the life of a man, so that to renounce her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be a very good imitation
of heroism, and to win her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be a discipline!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXVII.

<p/>Now is there civil war within the soul:
Resolve is thrust from off the sacred throne
By clamorous Needs, and Pride the grand-vizier
Makes humble compact, plays the supple part
Of envoy and deft-tongued apologist
For hungry rebels.


<p/>Happily Lydgate had ended by losing in the billiard-room, and brought
away no encouragement to make a raid on luck. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt
unmixed disgust with himself the next day when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had to pay four or
five pounds over and above his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gains, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) carried about with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a
most unpleasant vision of the figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had made, not only rubbing
elbows with the men at the Green Dragon but behaving just as they did.
A philosopher fallen to betting is hardly distinguishable from a
Philistine under the same circumstances: the difference will chiefly be
found in his (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) subsequent reflections, and Lydgate chewed a very
disagreeable cud in that way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reason told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) how the affair might
have been magnified into ruin by a slight change of scenery--if it had
been a gambling-house that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had turned into, where chance could be
clutched with both hands instead of being picked up with thumb and
fore-finger. Nevertheless, though reason strangled the desire to
gamble, there remained the feeling that, with an assurance of luck to
the needful amount, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have liked to gamble, rather than take the
alternative which was beginning to urge itself as inevitable.

<p/>That alternative was to apply to Mr. Bulstrode. Lydgate had so many
times boasted both to himself and others that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was totally
independent of Bulstrode, to whose plans he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had lent himself solely
because they enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to carry out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own ideas of professional
work and public benefit--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had so constantly in their personal
intercourse had his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pride sustained by the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was making a
good social use of this predominating banker, whose opinions he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought
contemptible and whose motives often seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) an absurd mixture of
contradictory impressions--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been creating for himself
strong ideal obstacles to the proffering of any considerable request to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own account.

<p/>Still, early in March his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) affairs were at that pass in which men begin
to say that their oaths were delivered in ignorance, and to perceive
that the act which they had called impossible to them is becoming
manifestly possible. With Dover's ugly security soon to be put in
force, with the proceeds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice immediately absorbed in paying
back debts, and with the chance, if the worst were known, of daily
supplies being refused on credit, above all with the vision of
Rosamond's hopeless discontent continually haunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), Lydgate had
begun to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should inevitably bend himself to ask help from
somebody or other. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had considered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should write
to Mr. Vincy; but on questioning Rosamond he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) found that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
suspected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had already applied twice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father, the last time
being since the disappointment from Sir Godwin; and papa had said that
Lydgate must look out for himself. <div class="bookquote">``Papa said he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had come, with one
bad year after another, to trade more and more on borrowed capital, and
had had to give up many indulgences; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) could not spare a single
hundred from the charges of his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) family. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) said, let Lydgate ask
Bulstrode: they have always been hand and glove.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Indeed, Lydgate himself had come to the conclusion that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must end
by asking for a free loan, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) relations with Bulstrode, more at least
than with any other man, might take the shape of a claim which was not
purely personal. Bulstrode had indirectly helped to cause the failure
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) practice, and had also been highly gratified by getting a
medical partner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) plans:--but who among us ever reduced himself
to the sort of dependence in which Lydgate now stood, without trying to
believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had claims which diminished the humiliation of asking?
It was true that of late there had seemed to be a new languor of
interest in Bulstrode about the Hospital; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) health had got worse,
and showed signs of a deep-seated nervous affection. In other respects
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not appear to be changed: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had always been highly polite, but
Lydgate had observed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from the first a marked coldness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
marriage and other private circumstances, a coldness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
hitherto preferred to any warmth of familiarity between them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
deferred the intention from day to day, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) habit of acting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
conclusions being made infirm by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) repugnance to every possible
conclusion and its consequent act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw Mr. Bulstrode often, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
did not try to use any occasion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) private purpose. At one moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I will write a letter: I prefer that to any circuitous
talk;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at another he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``No; if I were talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), I could
make a retreat before any signs of disinclination.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Still the days passed and no letter was written, no special interview
sought. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) shrinking from the humiliation of a dependent attitude
towards Bulstrode, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) began to familiarize his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) imagination with another
step even more unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) remembered self. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) began spontaneously to
consider whether it would be possible to carry out that puerile notion
of Rosamond's which had often made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) angry, namely, that they should
quit Middlemarch without seeing anything beyond that preface. The
question came--<div class="bookquote">``Would any man buy the practice of me even now, for as
little as it is worth? Then the sale might happen as a necessary
preparation for going away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) taking this step, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) still felt to be a
contemptible relinquishment of present work, a guilty turning aside
from what was a real and might be a widening channel for worthy
activity, to start again without any justified destination, there was
this obstacle, that the purchaser, if procurable at all, might not be
quickly forthcoming. And afterwards? Rosamond in a poor lodging,
though in the largest city or most distant town, would not find the
life that could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from gloom, and save him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) from the reproach of
having plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into it. For when a man is at the foot of the hill
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortunes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may stay a long while there in spite of
professional accomplishment. In the British climate there is no
incompatibility between scientific insight and furnished lodgings: the
incompatibility is chiefly between scientific ambition and a wife who
objects to that kind of residence.

<p/>But in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hesitation, opportunity came to decide him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). A
note from Mr. Bulstrode requested Lydgate to call on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) at the Bank.
A hypochondriacal tendency had shown itself in the banker's
constitution of late; and a lack of sleep, which was really only a
slight exaggeration of an habitual dyspeptic symptom, had been dwelt on
by him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) as a sign of threatening insanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) wanted to consult Lydgate
without delay on that particular morning, although he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had nothing to
tell beyond what he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had told before. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) listened eagerly to what
Lydgate had to say in dissipation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fears, though this too was
only repetition; and this moment in which Bulstrode was receiving a
medical opinion with a sense of comfort, seemed to make the
communication of a personal need to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) easier than it had been in
Lydgate's contemplation beforehand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been insisting that it
would be well for Mr. Bulstrode to relax his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) attention to business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``One sees how any mental strain, however slight, may affect a delicate
frame,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate at that stage of the consultation when the remarks
tend to pass from the personal to the general, <div class="bookquote">``by the deep stamp which
anxiety will make for a time even on the young and vigorous. I am
naturally very strong; yet I have been thoroughly shaken lately by an
accumulation of trouble.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I presume that a constitution in the susceptible state in which mine
at present is, would be especially liable to fall a victim to cholera,
if it visited our district. And since its appearance near London, we
may well besiege the Mercy-seat for our protection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bulstrode, not intending to evade Lydgate's allusion, but really
preoccupied with alarms about himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have at all events taken your share in using good practical
precautions for the town, and that is the best mode of asking for
protection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken
metaphor and bad logic of the banker's religion, somewhat increased by
the apparent deafness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sympathy. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind had taken up its
long-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding
appliances; and I think that if the cholera should come, even our
enemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public
good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Truly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, with some coldness. ``With regard to what
you say, Mr. Lydgate, about the relaxation of my mental labor, I have
for some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect--a purpose of
a very decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary
withdrawal from the management of much business, whether benevolent or
commercial. Also I think of changing my residence for a time: probably
I shall close or let ``The Shrubs,<div class="bookquote">'' and take some place near the
coast--under advice of course as to salubrity. That would be a measure
which you would recommend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, falling backward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair, with
ill-repressed impatience under the banker's pale earnest eyes and
intense preoccupation with himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have for some time felt that I should open this subject with you in
relation to our Hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``Under the
circumstances I have indicated, of course I must cease to have any
personal share in the management, and it is contrary to my views of
responsibility to continue a large application of means to an
institution which I cannot watch over and to some extent regulate. I
shall therefore, in case of my ultimate decision to leave Middlemarch,
consider that I withdraw other support to the New Hospital than that
which will subsist in the fact that I chiefly supplied the expenses of
building it, and have contributed further large sums to its successful
working.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate's thought, when Bulstrode paused according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wont, was,
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has perhaps been losing a good deal of money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>This was the most
plausible explanation of a speech which had caused rather a startling
change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) expectations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said in reply--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The loss to the Hospital can hardly be made up, I fear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Bulstrode, in the same deliberate, silvery tone;
<div class="bookquote">``except by some changes of plan. The only person who may be certainly
counted on as willing to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) contributions is Mrs. Casaubon.
I have had an interview with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on the subject, and I have pointed out
to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as I am about to do to you, that it will be desirable to win a
more general support to the New Hospital by a change of system.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Another pause, but Lydgate did not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The change I mean is an amalgamation with the Infirmary, so that the
New Hospital shall be regarded as a special addition to the elder
institution, having the same directing board. It will be necessary,
also, that the medical management of the two shall be combined. In
this way any difficulty as to the adequate maintenance of our new
establishment will be removed; the benevolent interests of the town
will cease to be divided.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bulstrode had lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes from Lydgate's face to the buttons
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) again paused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt that is a good device as to ways and means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
with an edge of irony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone. <div class="bookquote">``But I can't be expected to rejoice
in it at once, since one of the first results will be that the other
medical men will upset or interrupt my methods, if it were only because
they are mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I myself, as you know, Mr. Lydgate, highly valued the opportunity of
new and independent procedure which you have diligently employed: the
original plan, I confess, was one which I had much at heart, under
submission to the Divine Will. But since providential indications
demand a renunciation from me, I renounce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode showed a rather exasperating ability in this conversation.
The broken metaphor and bad logic of motive which had stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hearer's contempt were quite consistent with a mode of putting the
facts which made it difficult for Lydgate to vent his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own indignation
and disappointment. After some rapid reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) only asked--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What did Mrs. Casaubon say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was the further statement which I wished to make to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said
Bulstrode, who had thoroughly prepared his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) ministerial explanation.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is, you are aware, a woman of most munificent disposition, and
happily in possession--not I presume of great wealth, but of funds
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) can well spare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has informed me that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) has
destined the chief part of those funds to another purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is
willing to consider whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) cannot fully take my place in relation
to the Hospital. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wishes for ample time to mature her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) thoughts
on the subject, and I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) that there is no need for
haste--that, in fact, my own plans are not yet absolute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate was ready to say, <div class="bookquote">``If Mrs. Casaubon would take your place,
there would be gain, instead of loss.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>But there was still a weight on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind which arrested this cheerful candor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose,
then, that I may enter into the subject with Mrs. Casaubon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Precisely; that is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) expressly desires. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) decision, she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
says, will much depend on what you can tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>). But not at present:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is, I believe, just setting out on a journey. I have her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) letter
here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, drawing it out, and reading from it. <div class="bookquote">'''I am
immediately otherwise engaged,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) says. <div class="bookquote">``I am going into Yorkshire
with Sir James and Lady Chettam; and the conclusions I come to about
some land which I am to see there may affect my power of contributing
to the Hospital.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Thus, Mr. Lydgate, there is no haste necessary in
this matter; but I wished to apprise you beforehand of what may
possibly occur.''

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode returned the letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) side-pocket, and changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
attitude as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) business were closed. Lydgate, whose renewed hope
about the Hospital only made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) more conscious of the facts which
poisoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hope, felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) effort after help, if made at all,
must be made now and vigorously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for giving me full notice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, with a
firm intention in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tone, yet with an interruptedness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) delivery
which showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spoke unwillingly. <div class="bookquote">``The highest object to me is
my profession, and I had identified the Hospital with the best use I
can at present make of my profession. But the best use is not always
the same with monetary success. Everything which has made the Hospital
unpopular has helped with other causes--I think they are all connected
with my professional zeal--to make me unpopular as a practitioner. I
get chiefly patients who can't pay me. I should like them best, if I
had nobody to pay on my own side.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate waited a little, but
Bulstrode only bowed, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fixedly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went on with the
same interrupted enunciation--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were biting an objectional leek.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have slipped into money difficulties which I can see no way out of,
unless some one who trusts me and my future will advance me a sum
without other security. I had very little fortune left when I came
here. I have no prospects of money from my own family. My expenses,
in consequence of my marriage, have been very much greater than I had
expected. The result at this moment is that it would take a thousand
pounds to clear me. I mean, to free me from the risk of having all my
goods sold in security of my largest debt--as well as to pay my other
debts--and leave anything to keep us a little beforehand with our small
income. I find that it is out of the question that my wife's father
should make such an advance. That is why I mention my position to--to
the only other man who may be held to have some personal connection
with my prosperity or ruin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate hated to hear himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had spoken now, and had spoken
with unmistakable directness. Mr. Bulstrode replied without haste, but
also without hesitation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am grieved, though, I confess, not surprised by this information,
Mr. Lydgate. For my own part, I regretted your alliance with my
brother-in-law's family, which has always been of prodigal habits, and
which has already been much indebted to me for sustainment in its
present position. My advice to you, Mr. Lydgate, would be, that
instead of involving yourself in further obligations, and continuing a
doubtful struggle, you should simply become a bankrupt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would not improve my prospect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, rising and speaking
bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``even if it were a more agreeable thing in itself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is always a trial,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode; <div class="bookquote">``but trial, my dear sir, is
our portion here, and is a needed corrective. I recommend you to weigh
the advice I have given.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, not quite knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I have
occupied you too long. Good-day.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXVIII.

<p/>``What suit of grace hath Virtue to put on
If Vice shall wear as good, and do as well?
If Wrong, if Craft, if Indiscretion
Act as fair parts with ends as laudable?
Which all this mighty volume of events
The world, the universal map of deeds,
Strongly controls, and proves from all descents,
That the directest course still best succeeds.
For should not grave and learn'd Experience
That looks with the eyes of all the world beside,
And with all ages holds intelligence,
Go safer than Deceit without a guide!
--DANIEL: Musophilus.


<p/>That change of plan and shifting of interest which Bulstrode stated or
betrayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) conversation with Lydgate, had been determined in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
by some severe experience which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had gone through since the epoch of
Mr. Larcher's sale, when Raffles had recognized Will Ladislaw, and when
the banker had in vain attempted an act of restitution which might move
Divine Providence to arrest painful consequences.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) certainty that Raffles, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) were dead, would return to
Middlemarch before long, had been justified. On Christmas Eve he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had
reappeared at The Shrubs. Bulstrode was at home to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and
hinder his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) communication with the rest of the family, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not
altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising
himself and alarming his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife. Raffles proved more unmanageable than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had shown himself to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) former appearances, his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) chronic state
of mental restlessness, the growing effect of habitual intemperance,
quickly shaking off every impression from what was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
insisted on staying in the house, and Bulstrode, weighing two sets of
evils, felt that this was at least not a worse alternative than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
going into the town. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own room for the evening and
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to bed, Raffles all the while amusing himself with the
annoyance he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was causing this decent and highly prosperous
fellow-sinner, an amusement which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) facetiously expressed as sympathy
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) friend's pleasure in entertaining a man who had been
serviceable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), and who had not had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) earnings. There was a
cunning calculation under this noisy joking--a cool resolve to extract
something the handsomer from Bulstrode as payment for release from this
new application of torture. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) cunning had a little overcast its
mark.

<p/>Bulstrode was indeed more tortured than the coarse fibre of Raffles
could enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to imagine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was simply
taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might
otherwise injure himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) implied, without the direct form of
falsehood, that there was a family tie which bound him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to this care,
and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged
caution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next
morning. In these hints he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode
with precautionary information for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) daughters and servants, and
accounting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) allowing no one but himself to enter the room even
with food and drink. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles
should be overheard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) loud and plain references to past facts--lest
Mrs. Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), how betray his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) terror by opening the door to
detect her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely
to take so low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but
fear was stronger than the calculation of probabilities.

<p/>In this way Raffles had pushed the torture too far, and produced an
effect which had not been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) plan. By showing himself hopelessly
unmanageable he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had made Bulstrode feel that a strong defiance was the
only resource left. After taking Raffles to bed that night the banker
ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) closed carriage to be ready at half-past seven the next
morning. At six o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had already been long dressed, and had
spent some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) wretchedness in prayer, pleading his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) motives for
averting the worst evil if in anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had used falsity and spoken
what was not true before God. For Bulstrode shrank from a direct lie
with an intensity disproportionate to the number of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) more indirect
misdeeds. But many of these misdeeds were like the subtle muscular
movements which are not taken account of in the consciousness, though
they bring about the end that we fix our mind on and desire. And it is
only what we are vividly conscious of that we can vividly imagine to be
seen by Omniscience.

<p/>Bulstrode carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) candle to the bedside of Raffles, who was
apparently in a painful dream. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) stood silent, hoping that the
presence of the light would serve to waken the sleeper gradually and
gently, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) feared some noise as the consequence of a too sudden
awakening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had watched for a couple of minutes or more the
shudderings and pantings which seemed likely to end in waking, when
Raffles, with a long half-stifled moan, started up and stared round him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
in terror, trembling and gasping. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) made no further noise, and
Bulstrode, setting down the candle, awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) recovery.

<p/>It was a quarter of an hour later before Bulstrode, with a cold
peremptoriness of manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not before shown, said, <div class="bookquote">``I came
to call you thus early, Mr. Raffles, because I have ordered the
carriage to be ready at half-past seven, and intend myself to conduct
you as far as Ilsely, where you can either take the railway or await a
coach.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Raffles was about to speak, but Bulstrode anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
imperiously with the words, <div class="bookquote">``Be silent, sir, and hear what I have to
say. I shall supply you with money now, and I will furnish you with a
reasonable sum from time to time, on your application to me by letter;
but if you choose to present yourself here again, if you return to
Middlemarch, if you use your tongue in a manner injurious to me, you
will have to live on such fruits as your malice can bring you, without
help from me. Nobody will pay you well for blasting my name: I know
the worst you can do against me, and I shall brave it if you dare to
thrust yourself upon me again. Get up, sir, and do as I order you,
without noise, or I will send for a policeman to take you off my
premises, and you may carry your stories into every pothouse in the
town, but you shall have no sixpence from me to pay your expenses
there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode had rarely in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life spoken with such nervous energy: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
had been deliberating on this speech and its probable effects through a
large part of the night; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did not trust to its ultimately
saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) from any return of Raffles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had concluded that it was the
best throw he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could make. It succeeded in enforcing submission from
the jaded man this morning: his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) empoisoned system at this moment
quailed before Bulstrode's cold, resolute bearing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was taken off
quietly in the carriage before the family breakfast time. The servants
imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to be a poor relation, and were not surprised that a
strict man like their master, who held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head high in the world,
should be ashamed of such a cousin and want to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The
banker's drive of ten miles with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated companion was a dreary
beginning of the Christmas day; but at the end of the drive, Raffles
had recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) spirits, and parted in a contentment for which there
was the good reason that the banker had given him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) a hundred pounds.
Various motives urged Bulstrode to this open-handedness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) did not
himself inquire closely into all of them. As he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had stood watching
Raffles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) uneasy sleep, it had certainly entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) mind that the
man had been much shattered since the first gift of two hundred pounds.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had taken care to repeat the incisive statement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) resolve not
to be played on any more; and had tried to penetrate Raffles with the
fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had shown the risks of bribing him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to be quite equal to
the risks of defying him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>). But when, freed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) repulsive presence,
Bulstrode returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) quiet home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) no confidence
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had secured more than a respite. It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had had a
loathsome dream, and could not shake off its images with their hateful
kindred of sensations--as if on all the pleasant surroundings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
life a dangerous reptile had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) slimy traces.

<p/>Who can know how much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) most inward life is made up of the
thoughts he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) believes other men to have about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), until that fabric of
opinion is threatened with ruin?

<p/>Bulstrode was only the more conscious that there was a deposit of
uneasy presentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife's mind, because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) carefully avoided
any allusion to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been used every day to taste the flavor of
supremacy and the tribute of complete deference: and the certainty that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was watched or measured with a hidden suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) having some
discreditable secret, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) voice totter when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was speaking to
edification. Foreseeing, to men of Bulstrode's anxious temperament, is
often worse than seeing; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) imagination continually heightened the
anguish of an imminent disgrace. Yes, imminent; for if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) defiance of
Raffles did not keep the man away--and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) prayed for this result
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) hardly hoped for it--the disgrace was certain. In vain he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) said to
himself that, if permitted, it would be a divine visitation, a
chastisement, a preparation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) recoiled from the imagined burning; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) judged that it must be more for the Divine glory that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) should
escape dishonor. That recoil had at last urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to make
preparations for quitting Middlemarch. If evil truth must be reported
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) would then be at a less scorching distance from the contempt
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) old neighbors; and in a new scene, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) life would not have
gathered the same wide sensibility, the tormentor, if he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>),
would be less formidable. To leave the place finally would, he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) knew,
be extremely painful to his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) wife, and on other grounds he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) would have
preferred to stay where he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) had struck root. Hence he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>)
preparations at first in a conditional way, wishing to leave on all
sides an opening for his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) return after brief absence, if any favorable
intervention of Providence should dissipate his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) fears. He (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) was
preparing to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) management of the Bank, and to give up any
active control of other commercial affairs in the neighborhood, on the
ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) failing health, but without excluding his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) future
resumption of such work. The measure would cause him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) some added
expense and some diminution of income beyond what he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) had already
undergone from the general depression of trade; and the Hospital
presented itself as a principal object of outlay on which he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) could
fairly economize.

<p/>This was the experience which had determined his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) conversation with
Lydgate. But at this time his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) arrangements had most of them gone no
farther than a stage at which he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) could recall them if they proved to be
unnecessary. He (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) continually deferred the final steps; in the midst of
his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) fears, like many a man who is in danger of shipwreck or of being
dashed from his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) carriage by runaway horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) had a clinging
impression that something would happen to hinder the worst, and that to
spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) life by a late transplantation might be over-hasty--especially
since it was difficult to account satisfactorily to his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) wife for the
project of their indefinite exile from the only place where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would
like to live.

<p/>Among the affairs Bulstrode had to care for, was the management of the
farm at Stone Court in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) absence; and on this as well as on
all other matters connected with any houses and land he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) possessed in or
about Middlemarch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) had consulted Caleb Garth. Like every one else
who had business of that sort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) wanted to get the agent who was more
anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) employer's interests than his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) own. With regard to
Stone Court, since Bulstrode wished to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hold on the stock,
and to have an arrangement by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) himself could, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) chose,
resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) favorite recreation of superintendence, Caleb had advised
him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) not to trust to a mere bailiff, but to let the land, stock, and
implements yearly, and take a proportionate share of the proceeds.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``May I trust to you to find me a tenant on these terms, Mr. Garth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``And will you mention to me the yearly sum which would
repay you for managing these affairs which we have discussed together?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll think about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) blunt way. <div class="bookquote">``I'll see how I
can make it out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If it had not been that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had to consider Fred Vincy's future, Mr.
Garth would not probably have been glad of any addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) work, of
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) wife was always fearing an excess for him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) grew older.
But on quitting Bulstrode after that conversation, a very alluring idea
occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) about this said letting of Stone Court. What if
Bulstrode would agree to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) placing Fred Vincy there on the
understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), Caleb Garth, should be responsible for the
management? It would be an excellent schooling for Fred; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) might make
a modest income there, and still have time left to get knowledge by
helping in other business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) notion to Mrs. Garth with
such evident delight that she (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) could not bear to chill his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) pleasure by
expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) constant fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) undertaking too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The lad would be as happy as two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) said, throwing himself back in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) chair, and looking radiant, <div class="bookquote">``if I could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) it was all
settled. Think; Susan! His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind had been running on that place for
years before old Featherstone died. And it would be as pretty a turn
of things as could be that he (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) should hold the place in a good
industrious way after all--by his (<font color='blue'><b>Featherstone</b></font>) taking to business. For it's likely
enough Bulstrode might let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) go on, and gradually buy the stock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
hasn't made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mind, I can see, whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) shall settle
somewhere else as a lasting thing. I never was better pleased with a
notion in my life. And then the children might be married by-and-by,
Susan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not give any hint of the plan to Fred, until you are sure
that Bulstrode would agree to the plan?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth, in a tone of
gentle caution. <div class="bookquote">``And as to marriage, Caleb, we old people need not
help to hasten it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head aside. <div class="bookquote">``Marriage is
a taming thing. Fred would want less of my bit and bridle. However, I
shall say nothing till I know the ground I'm treading on. I shall
speak to Bulstrode again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) earliest opportunity of doing so. Bulstrode had anything
but a warm interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) nephew Fred Vincy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had a strong wish
to secure Mr. Garth's services on many scattered points of business at
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was sure to be a considerable loser, if they were under less
conscientious management. On that ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) made no objection to Mr.
Garth's proposal; and there was also another reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) was not
sorry to give a consent which was to benefit one of the Vincy family.
It was that Mrs. Bulstrode, having heard of Lydgate's debts, had been
anxious to know whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband could not do something for poor
Rosamond, and had been much troubled on learning from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) that
Lydgate's affairs were not easily remediable, and that the wisest plan
was to let them <div class="bookquote">``take their course.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bulstrode had then said for
the first time, <div class="bookquote">``I think you are always a little hard towards my
family, Nicholas. And I am sure I have no reason to deny any of my
relatives. Too worldly they may be, but no one ever had to say that
they were not respectable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bulstrode, wincing under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife's eyes,
which were filling with tears, <div class="bookquote">``I have supplied your brother with a
great deal of capital. I cannot be expected to take care of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
married children.''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>That seemed to be true, and Mrs. Bulstrode's remonstrance subsided into
pity for poor Rosamond, whose extravagant education she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had always
foreseen the fruits of.

<p/>But remembering that dialogue, Mr. Bulstrode felt that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had to
talk to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife fully about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) plan of quitting Middlemarch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
should be glad to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had made an arrangement which might
be for the good of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nephew Fred. At present he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had merely mentioned
to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) thought of shutting up The Shrubs for a few months, and
taking a house on the Southern Coast.

<p/>Hence Mr. Garth got the assurance he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) desired, namely, that in case of
Bulstrode's departure from Middlemarch for an indefinite time, Fred
Vincy should be allowed to have the tenancy of Stone Court on the terms
proposed.

<p/>Caleb was so elated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hope of this <div class="bookquote">``neat turn''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>being given to
things, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) self-control had not been braced by a little
affectionate wifely scolding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) would have betrayed everything to
Mary, wanting <div class="bookquote">``to give the child comfort.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) restrained
himself, and kept in strict privacy from Fred certain visits which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
was making to Stone Court, in order to look more thoroughly into the
state of the land and stock, and take a preliminary estimate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was
certainly more eager in these visits than the probable speed of events
required him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) to be; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was stimulated by a fatherly delight in
occupying his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) mind with this bit of probable happiness which he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) held in
store like a hidden birthday gift for Fred and Mary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But suppose the whole scheme should turn out to be a castle in the
air?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>replied Caleb; <div class="bookquote">``the castle will tumble about nobody's
head.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Ecclesiasticus.


<p/>Mr. Bulstrode was still seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) manager's room at the Bank, about
three o'clock of the same day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had received Lydgate there,
when the clerk entered to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) horse was waiting, and also that
Mr. Garth was outside and begged to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By all means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode; and Caleb entered. <div class="bookquote">``Pray sit down, Mr.
Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>continued the banker, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) suavest tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you
count your minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head on one side, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) seated himself and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hat on the floor.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) long fingers
droop between his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it
were sharing some thought which filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) large quiet brow.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode, like every one else who knew Caleb, was used to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
slowness in beginning to speak on any topic which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt to be
important, and rather expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was about to recur to the buying
of some houses in Blindman's Court, for the sake of pulling them down,
as a sacrifice of property which would be well repaid by the influx of
air and light on that spot. It was by propositions of this kind that
Caleb was sometimes troublesome to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) employers; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had usually
found Bulstrode ready to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in projects of improvement, and they
had got on well together. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) spoke again, however, it was to say,
in rather a subdued voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have just come away from Stone Court, Mr. Bulstrode.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You found nothing wrong there, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the banker; <div class="bookquote">``I was there
myself yesterday. Abel has done well with the lambs this year.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, looking up gravely, <div class="bookquote">``there is something wrong--a
stranger, who is very ill, I think. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wants a doctor, and I came to
tell you of that. His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) name is Raffles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) saw the shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) words passing through Bulstrode's frame. On
this subject the banker had thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) fears were too constantly
on the watch to be taken by surprise; but he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had been mistaken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) said in a compassionate tone, though his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) lips
trembled a little. <div class="bookquote">``Do you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) came there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I took him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, quietly--<div class="bookquote">``took him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) up in my gig. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
had got down from the coach, and was walking a little beyond the
turning from the toll-house, and I overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) remembered seeing
me with you once before, at Stone Court, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) asked me to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>)
on. I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was ill: it seemed to me the right thing to do, to carry
him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) under shelter. And now I think you should lose no time in getting
advice for him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Caleb took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hat from the floor as he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) ended, and
rose slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) seat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, whose mind was very active at this moment.
<div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you will yourself oblige me, Mr. Garth, by calling at Mr.
Lydgate's as you pass--or stay! he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) may at this hour probably be at the
Hospital. I will first send my man on the horse there with a note this
instant, and then I will myself ride to Stone Court.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode quickly wrote a note, and went out himself to give the
commission to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) man. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) returned, Caleb was standing as before
with one hand on the back of the chair, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hat with the other.
In Bulstrode's mind the dominant thought was, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Raffles only
spoke to Garth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) illness. Garth may wonder, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) must have done
before, at this disreputable fellow's claiming intimacy with me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>)
will know nothing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) is friendly to me--I can be of use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) longed for some confirmation of this hopeful conjecture, but to have
asked any question as to what Raffles had said or done would have been
to betray fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) said, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) usual
tone of politeness. <div class="bookquote">``My servant will be back in a few minutes, and I
shall then go myself to see what can be done for this unfortunate man.
Perhaps you had some other business with me? If so, pray be seated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, making a slight gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) right hand to
waive the invitation. <div class="bookquote">``I wish to say, Mr. Bulstrode, that I must
request you to put your business into some other hands than mine. I am
obliged to you for your handsome way of meeting me--about the letting
of Stone Court, and all other business. But I must give it up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A
sharp certainty entered like a stab into Bulstrode's soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is sudden, Mr. Garth,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could say at first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb; <div class="bookquote">``but it is quite fixed. I must give it up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) spoke with a firmness which was very gentle, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could see
that Bulstrode seemed to cower under that gentleness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) face looking
dried and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes swerving away from the glance which rested on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).
Caleb felt a deep pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) could have used no pretexts to
account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) resolve, even if they would have been of any use.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been led to this, I apprehend, by some slanders concerning me
uttered by that unhappy creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, anxious now to know
the utmost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is true. I can't deny that I act upon what I heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are a conscientious man, Mr. Garth--a man, I trust, who feels
himself accountable to God. You would not wish to injure me by being
too ready to believe a slander,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, casting about for
pleas that might be adapted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hearer's mind. <div class="bookquote">``That is a poor
reason for giving up a connection which I think I may say will be
mutually beneficial.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I would injure no man if I could help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb; <div class="bookquote">``even if I
thought God winked at it. I hope I should have a feeling for my
fellow-creature. But, sir--I am obliged to believe that this Raffles
has told me the truth. And I can't be happy in working with you, or
profiting by you. It hurts my mind. I must beg you to seek another
agent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Garth. But I must at least claim to know the worst
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) has told you. I must know what is the foul speech that I am
liable to be the victim of,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, a certain amount of anger
beginning to mingle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) humiliation before this quiet man who
renounced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) benefits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's needless,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand, bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head
slightly, and not swerving from the tone which had in it the merciful
intention to spare this pitiable man. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) has said to me will
never pass from my lips, unless something now unknown forces it from
me. If you led a harmful life for gain, and kept others out of their
rights by deceit, to get the more for yourself, I dare say you
repent--you would like to go back, and can't: that must be a bitter
thing'' (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>--Caleb paused a moment and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head--<div class="bookquote">``it is not for me to
make your life harder to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you do--you do make it harder to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode constrained
into a genuine, pleading cry. <div class="bookquote">``You make it harder to me by turning
your back on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I'm forced to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, still more gently, lifting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
hand. <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry. I don't judge you and say, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is wicked, and I am
righteous. God forbid. I don't know everything. A man may do wrong,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will may rise clear out of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life
clear. That's a bad punishment. If it is so with you,--well, I'm
very sorry for you. But I have that feeling inside me, that I can't go
on working with you. That's all, Mr. Bulstrode. Everything else is
buried, so far as my will goes. And I wish you good-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One moment, Mr. Garth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, hurriedly. <div class="bookquote">``I may trust then
to your solemn assurance that you will not repeat either to man or
woman what--even if it have any degree of truth in it--is yet a
malicious representation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>Caleb's wrath was stirred, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said,
indignantly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I have said it if I didn't mean it? I am in no fear of
you. Such tales as that will never tempt my tongue.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me--I am agitated--I am the victim of this abandoned man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop a bit! you have got to consider whether you didn't help to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worse, when you profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vices.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are wronging me by too readily believing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode,
oppressed, as by a nightmare, with the inability to deny flatly what
Raffles might have said; and yet feeling it an escape that Caleb had
not so stated it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) as to ask for that flat denial.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand deprecatingly; <div class="bookquote">``I am ready to
believe better, when better is proved. I rob you of no good chance.
As to speaking, I hold it a crime to expose a man's sin unless I'm
clear it must be done to save the innocent. That is my way of
thinking, Mr. Bulstrode, and what I say, I've no need to swear. I wish
you good-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Some hours later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was at home, Caleb said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) wife,
incidentally, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had had some little differences with Bulstrode,
and that in consequence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had given up all notion of taking Stone
Court, and indeed had resigned doing further business for him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was disposed to interfere too much, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Garth,
imagining that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) husband had been touched on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sensitive point, and
not been allowed to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought right as to materials and modes
of work.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh,''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, bowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) hand gravely. And
Mrs. Garth knew that this was a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) not intending to speak
further on the subject.

<p/>As for Bulstrode, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had almost immediately mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) horse and set
off for Stone Court, being anxious to arrive there before Lydgate.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind was crowded with images and conjectures, which were a language
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hopes and fears, just as we hear tones from the vibrations which
shake our whole system. The deep humiliation with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had winced
under Caleb Garth's knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) past and rejection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
patronage, alternated with and almost gave way to the sense of safety
in the fact that Garth, and no other, had been the man to whom Raffles
had spoken. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) a sort of earnest that Providence
intended his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) rescue from worse consequences; the way being thus left
open for the hope of secrecy. That Raffles should be afflicted with
illness, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) should have been led to Stone Court rather than
elsewhere--Bulstrode's heart fluttered at the vision of probabilities
which these events conjured up. If it should turn out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was
freed from all danger of disgrace--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could breathe in perfect
liberty--his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life should be more consecrated than it had ever been
before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mentally lifted up this vow as if it would urge the result
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) longed for--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) tried to believe in the potency of that prayerful
resolution--its potency to determine death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) ought to
say, <div class="bookquote">``Thy will be done;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said it often. But the intense desire
remained that the will of God might be the death of that hated man.

<p/>Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrived at Stone Court he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) could not see the change in
Raffles without a shock. But for his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) pallor and feebleness, Bulstrode
would have called the change in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) entirely mental. Instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
loud tormenting mood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) showed an intense, vague terror, and seemed to
deprecate Bulstrode's anger, because the money was all gone--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
been robbed--it had half of it been taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had only come
here because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was ill and somebody was hunting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)--somebody was
after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had told nobody anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mouth shut.
Bulstrode, not knowing the significance of these symptoms, interpreted
this new nervous susceptibility into a means of alarming Raffles into
true confessions, and taxed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) with falsehood in saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
not told anything, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had just told the man who took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) up in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) gig and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to Stone Court. Raffles denied this with
solemn adjurations; the fact being that the links of consciousness were
interrupted in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) minute terror-stricken narrative to
Caleb Garth had been delivered under a set of visionary impulses which
had dropped back into darkness.

<p/>Bulstrode's heart sank again at this sign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could get no grasp
over the wretched man's mind, and that no word of Raffles could be
trusted as to the fact which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) most wanted to know, namely, whether or
not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had really kept silence to every one in the neighborhood except
Caleb Garth. The housekeeper had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) without the least constraint
of manner that since Mr. Garth left, Raffles had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) for beer,
and after that had not spoken, seeming very ill. On that side it might
be concluded that there had been no betrayal. Mrs. Abel thought, like
the servants at The Shrubs, that the strange man belonged to the
unpleasant <div class="bookquote">``kin''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>who are among the troubles of the rich; she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) had at
first referred the kinship to Mr. Rigg, and where there was property
left, the buzzing presence of such large blue-bottles seemed natural
enough. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) could be <div class="bookquote">``kin''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to Bulstrode as well was not so clear,
but Mrs. Abel agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) husband that there was <div class="bookquote">``no knowing,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>a
proposition which had a great deal of mental food for her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>)
shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) head over it without further speculation.

<p/>In less than an hour Lydgate arrived. Bulstrode met him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) outside the
wainscoted parlor, where Raffles was, and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have called you in, Mr. Lydgate, to an unfortunate man who was once
in my employment, many years ago. Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to America, and
returned I fear to an idle dissolute life. Being destitute, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a
claim on me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was slightly connected with Rigg, the former owner of
this place, and in consequence found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way here. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
seriously ill: apparently his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind is affected. I feel bound to do the
utmost for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Raffles/John Raffles</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate, who had the remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) last conversation with
Bulstrode strongly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), was not disposed to say an unnecessary
word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and bowed slightly in answer to this account; but just
before entering the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) turned automatically and said, <div class="bookquote">``What is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
name?'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--to know names being as much a part of the medical man's
accomplishment as of the practical politician's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Raffles, John Raffles,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, who hoped that whatever became
of Raffles, Lydgate would never know any more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had thoroughly examined and considered the patient, Lydgate
ordered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should go to bed, and be kept there in as complete
quiet as possible, and then went with Bulstrode into another room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a serious case, I apprehend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the banker, before Lydgate
began to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--and yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, half dubiously. <div class="bookquote">``It is difficult to
decide as to the possible effect of long-standing complications; but
the man had a robust constitution to begin with. I should not expect
this attack to be fatal, though of course the system is in a ticklish
state. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be well watched and attended to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will remain here myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Abel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>)
husband are inexperienced. I can easily remain here for the night, if
you will oblige me by taking a note for Mrs. Bulstrode.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think that is hardly necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seems
tame and terrified enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) might become more unmanageable. But
there is a man here--is there not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have more than once stayed here a few nights for the sake of
seclusion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, indifferently; <div class="bookquote">``I am quite disposed to do
so now. Mrs. Abel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) husband can relieve or aid me, if necessary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well. Then I need give my directions only to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
not feeling surprised at a little peculiarity in Bulstrode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think, then, that the case is hopeful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, when
Lydgate had ended giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) orders.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unless there turn out to be further complications, such as I have not
at present detected--yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may pass on to a worse
stage; but I should not wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) got better in a few days, by
adhering to the treatment I have prescribed. There must be firmness.
Remember, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) calls for liquors of any sort, not to give them to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
In my opinion, men in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) condition are oftener killed by treatment
than by the disease. Still, new symptoms may arise. I shall come
again to-morrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>After waiting for the note to be carried to Mrs. Bulstrode, Lydgate
rode away, forming no conjectures, in the first instance, about the
history of Raffles, but rehearsing the whole argument, which had lately
been much stirred by the publication of Dr. Ware's abundant experience
in America, as to the right way of treating cases of alcoholic
poisoning such as this. Lydgate, when abroad, had already been
interested in this question: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was strongly convinced against the
prevalent practice of allowing alcohol and persistently administering
large doses of opium; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had repeatedly acted on this conviction
with a favorable result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The man is in a diseased state,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``but there's a good deal
of wear in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an object of charity to
Bulstrode. It is curious what patches of hardness and tenderness lie
side by side in men's dispositions. Bulstrode seems the most
unsympathetic fellow I ever saw about some people, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has taken
no end of trouble, and spent a great deal of money, on benevolent
objects. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has some test by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) finds out whom Heaven
cares for--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mind that it doesn't care for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This streak of bitterness came from a plenteous source, and kept
widening in the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) neared Lowick Gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had not been there since his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) first interview with Bulstrode in the
morning, having been found at the Hospital by the banker's messenger;
and for the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) home without the vision
of any expedient in the background which left him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) a hope of raising
money enough to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) from the coming destitution of everything
which made his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) married life tolerable--everything which saved him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) and
Rosamond from that bare isolation in which they would be forced to
recognize how little of a comfort they could be to each other. It was
more bearable to do without tenderness for himself than to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
own tenderness could make no amends for the lack of other things to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). The sufferings of his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) own pride from humiliations past and to
come were keen enough, yet they were hardly distinguishable to himself
from that more acute pain which dominated them--the pain of foreseeing
that Rosamond would come to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) chiefly as the cause of
disappointment and unhappiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had never liked the
makeshifts of poverty, and they had never before entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>)
prospects for himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was beginning now to imagine how two
creatures who loved each other, and had a stock of thoughts in common,
might laugh over their shabby furniture, and their calculations how far
they could afford butter and eggs. But the glimpse of that poetry
seemed as far off from him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) as the carelessness of the golden age; in
poor Rosamond's mind there was not room enough for luxuries to look
small in. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) got down from his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) horse in a very sad mood, and went into
the house, not expecting to be cheered except by his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) dinner, and
reflecting that before the evening closed it would be wise to tell
Rosamond of his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) application to Bulstrode and its failure. It would be
well not to lose time in preparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) for the worst.

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) dinner waited long for him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was able to eat it. For
on entering he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) found that Dover's agent had already put a man in the
house, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) asked where Mrs. Lydgate was, he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) went up and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stretched on the bed pale
and silent, without an answer even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face to any word or look of
his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) sat down by the bed and leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said with almost a
cry of prayer--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me for this misery, my poor Rosamond! Let us only love one
another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) silently, still with the blank despair on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face;
but then the tears began to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) blue eyes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lip trembled.
The strong man had had too much to bear that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head fall
beside hers and sobbed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) father early in the morning--it
seemed now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from doing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
pleased. In half an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came back, and said that papa and mamma
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to go and stay with them while things were in this miserable
state. Papa said he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) could do nothing about the debt--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) paid this,
there would be half-a-dozen more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had better come back home again
till Lydgate had got a comfortable home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Do you object,
Tertius?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``But things are not coming to a crisis
immediately. There is no hurry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not go till to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond; <div class="bookquote">``I shall want to pack
my clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I would wait a little longer than to-morrow--there is no knowing
what may happen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with bitter irony. <div class="bookquote">``I may get my neck
broken, and that may make things easier to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Lydgate's misfortune and Rosamond's too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tenderness
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), which was both an emotional prompting and a
well-considered resolve, was inevitably interrupted by these outbursts
of indignation either ironical or remonstrant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thought them
totally unwarranted, and the repulsion which this exceptional severity
excited in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in danger of making the more persistent tenderness
unacceptable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see you do not wish me to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, with chill mildness; <div class="bookquote">``why
can you not say so, without that kind of violence? I shall stay until
you request me to do otherwise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate said no more, but went out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rounds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt bruised and
shattered, and there was a dark line under his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes which Rosamond had
not seen before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could not bear to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Tertius had a way
of taking things which made them a great deal worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).



<p/>CHAPTER LXX.

<p/>Our deeds still travel with us from afar,
And what we have been makes us what we are.''


<p/>Bulstrode's first object after Lydgate had left Stone Court was to
examine Raffles's pockets, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) imagined were sure to carry signs
in the shape of hotel-bills of the places he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had stopped in, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
not told the truth in saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had come straight from Liverpool
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was ill and had no money. There were various bills crammed
into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pocketbook, but none of a later date than Christmas at any
other place, except one, which bore date that morning. This was
crumpled up with a hand-bill about a horse-fair in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
tail-pockets, and represented the cost of three days' stay at an inn at
Bilkley, where the fair was held--a town at least forty miles from
Middlemarch. The bill was heavy, and since Raffles had no luggage with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), it seemed probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) portmanteau behind in
payment, in order to save money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) travelling fare; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) purse
was empty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had only a couple of sixpences and some loose pence
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) pockets.

<p/>Bulstrode gathered a sense of safety from these indications that
Raffles had really kept at a distance from Middlemarch since his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
memorable visit at Christmas. At a distance and among people who were
strangers to Bulstrode, what satisfaction could there be to Raffles's
tormenting, self-magnifying vein in telling old scandalous stories
about a Middlemarch banker? And what harm if he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) did talk? The chief
point now was to keep watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) as long as there was any danger of
that intelligible raving, that unaccountable impulse to tell, which
seemed to have acted towards Caleb Garth; and Bulstrode felt much
anxiety lest some such impulse should come over him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) at the sight of
Lydgate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sat up alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) through the night, only ordering the
housekeeper to lie down in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) clothes, so as to be ready when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
called her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), alleging his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own indisposition to sleep, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anxiety to
carry out the doctor's orders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did carry them out faithfully,
although Raffles was incessantly asking for brandy, and declaring that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was sinking away--that the earth was sinking away from under him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was restless and sleepless, but still quailing and manageable. On
the offer of the food ordered by Lydgate, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) refused, and the
denial of other things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) demanded, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) seemed to concentrate all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) terror on Bulstrode, imploringly deprecating his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) revenge
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) by starvation, and declaring with strong oaths that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had never
told any mortal a word against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Even this Bulstrode felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
would not have liked Lydgate to hear; but a more alarming sign of
fitful alternation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) delirium was, that in-the morning twilight
Raffles suddenly seemed to imagine a doctor present, addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and
declaring that Bulstrode wanted to starve him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to death out of revenge
for telling, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) never had told.

<p/>Bulstrode's native imperiousness and strength of determination served
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) well. This delicate-looking man, himself nervously perturbed,
found the needed stimulus in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strenuous circumstances, and through
that difficult night and morning, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the air of an animated
corpse returned to movement without warmth, holding the mastery by its
chill impassibility his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was intensely at work thinking of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had to guard against and what would win him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) security. Whatever prayers
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might lift up, whatever statements he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might inwardly make of this
man's wretched spiritual condition, and the duty he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself was under
to submit to the punishment divinely appointed for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rather than to
wish for evil to another--through all this effort to condense words
into a solid mental state, there pierced and spread with irresistible
vividness the images of the events he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired. And in the train of
those images came their apology. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not but see the death of
Raffles, and see in it his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own deliverance. What was the removal of
this wretched creature? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was impenitent--but were not public
criminals impenitent?--yet the law decided on their fate. Should
Providence in this case award death, there was no sin in contemplating
death as the desirable issue--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands from hastening
it--if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scrupulously did what was prescribed. Even here there might
be a mistake: human prescriptions were fallible things: Lydgate had
said that treatment had hastened death,--why not his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own method of
treatment? But of course intention was everything in the question of
right and wrong.

<p/>And Bulstrode set himself to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) intention separate from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
desire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) inwardly declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) intended to obey orders. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) have got into any argument about the validity of these
orders? It was only the common trick of desire--which avails itself of
any irrelevant scepticism, finding larger room for itself in all
uncertainty about effects, in every obscurity that looks like the
absence of law. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did obey the orders.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) anxieties continually glanced towards Lydgate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) remembrance
of what had taken place between them the morning before was accompanied
with sensibilities which had not been roused at all during the actual
scene. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had then cared but little about Lydgate's painful
impressions with regard to the suggested change in the Hospital, or
about the disposition towards himself which what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) held to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
justifiable refusal of a rather exorbitant request might call forth.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) recurred to the scene now with a perception that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had probably
made Lydgate his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) enemy, and with an awakened desire to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
or rather to create in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a strong sense of personal obligation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not at once made even an unreasonable
money-sacrifice. For in case of unpleasant suspicions, or even
knowledge gathered from the raving of Raffles, Bulstrode would have
felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had a defence in Lydgate's mind by having conferred a
momentous benefit on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). But the regret had perhaps come too late.

<p/>Strange, piteous conflict in the soul of this unhappy man, who had
longed for years to be better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was--who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) selfish
passions into discipline and clad them in severe robes, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
walked with them as a devout choir, till now that a terror had risen
among them, and they could chant no longer, but threw out their common
cries for safety.

<p/>It was nearly the middle of the day before Lydgate arrived: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
meant to come earlier, but had been detained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
shattered looks were noticed by Balstrode. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) immediately threw
himself into the consideration of the patient, and inquired strictly
into all that had occurred. Raffles was worse, would take hardly any
food, was persistently wakeful and restlessly raving; but still not
violent. Contrary to Bulstrode's alarmed expectation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) took little
notice of Lydgate's presence, and continued to talk or murmur
incoherently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, in private.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The symptoms are worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are less hopeful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I still think he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may come round. Are you going to stay here
yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, looking at Bulstrode with an abrupt question,
which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) uneasy, though in reality it was not due to any
suspicious conjecture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, governing himself and speaking with
deliberation. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bulstrode is advised of the reasons which detain
me. Mrs. Abel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) husband are not experienced enough to be left
quite alone, and this kind of responsibility is scarcely included in
their service of me. You have some fresh instructions, I presume.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>The chief new instruction that Lydgate had to give was on the
administration of extremely moderate doses of opium, in case of the
sleeplessness continuing after several hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had taken the
precaution of bringing opium in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gave minute
directions to Bulstrode as to the doses, and the point at which they
should cease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) insisted on the risk of not ceasing; and repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
order that no alcohol should be given.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``From what I see of the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) ended, <div class="bookquote">``narcotism is the only thing I
should be much afraid of. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) may wear through even without much food.
There's a good deal of strength in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You look ill yourself, Mr. Lydgate--a most unusual, I may say
unprecedented thing in my knowledge of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, showing a
solicitude as unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) indifference the day before, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) present
recklessness about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own fatigue was unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) habitual
self-cherishing anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``I fear you are harassed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, brusquely, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat, and ready to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Something new, I fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode, inquiringly. <div class="bookquote">``Pray be seated.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with some hauteur. <div class="bookquote">``I mentioned to you
yesterday what was the state of my affairs. There is nothing to add,
except that the execution has since then been actually put into my
house. One can tell a good deal of trouble in a short sentence. I
will say good morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Mr. Lydgate, stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode; <div class="bookquote">``I have been reconsidering
this subject. I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it
superficially. Mrs. Bulstrode is anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) niece, and I myself
should grieve at a calamitous change in your position. Claims on me
are numerous, but on reconsideration, I esteem it right that I should
incur a small sacrifice rather than leave you unaided. You said, I
think, that a thousand pounds would suffice entirely to free you from
your burthens, and enable you to recover a firm stand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, a great leap of joy within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) surmounting every
other feeling; <div class="bookquote">``that would pay all my debts, and leave me a little on
hand. I could set about economizing in our way of living. And
by-and-by my practice might look up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you will wait a moment, Mr. Lydgate, I will draw a check to that
amount. I am aware that help, to be effectual in these cases, should
be thorough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>While Bulstrode wrote, Lydgate turned to the window thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
home--thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life with its good start saved from frustration,
its good purposes still unbroken.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can give me a note of hand for this, Mr. Lydgate,''  (<font color='red'><b>the banker</b></font>)</div>said the
banker, advancing towards him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) with the check. <div class="bookquote">``And by-and-by, I hope,
you may be in circumstances gradually to repay me. Meanwhile, I have
pleasure in thinking that you will be released from further difficulty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am deeply obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``You have restored to me
the prospect of working with some happiness and some chance of good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a very natural movement in Bulstrode that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should
have reconsidered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) refusal: it corresponded with the more munificent
side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) character. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hack into a canter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
might get the sooner home, and tell the good news to Rosamond, and get
cash at the bank to pay over to Dover's agent, there crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) mind,
with an unpleasant impression, as from a dark-winged flight of evil
augury across his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) vision, the thought of that contrast in himself which
a few months had brought--that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) should be overjoyed at being under a
strong personal obligation--that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) should be overjoyed at getting
money for himself from Bulstrode.

<p/>The banker felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) had done something to nullify one cause of
uneasiness, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) was scarcely the easier. He (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) did not measure the
quantity of diseased motive which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) wish for Lydgate's
good-will, but the quantity was none the less actively there, like an
irritating agent in his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) blood. A man vows, and yet will not cast away
the means of breaking his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) vow. Is it that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) distinctly means to break
it? Not at all; but the desires which tend to break it are at work in
him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) dimly, and make their way into his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) imagination, and relax his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>)
muscles in the very moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) is telling himself over again the
reasons for his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) vow. Raffles, recovering quickly, returning to the
free use of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) odious powers--how could Bulstrode wish for that?
Raffles dead was the image that brought release, and indirectly he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
prayed for that way of release, beseeching that, if it were possible,
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) days here below might be freed from the threat of an
ignominy which would break him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) utterly as an instrument of God's
service. Lydgate's opinion was not on the side of promise that this
prayer would be fulfilled; and as the day advanced, Bulstrode felt
himself getting irritated at the persistent life in this man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
would fain have seen sinking into the silence of death: imperious will
stirred murderous impulses towards this brute life, over which will, by
itself, had no power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said inwardly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was getting too much
worn; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would not sit up with the patient to-night, but leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to
Mrs. Abel, who, if necessary, could call her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) husband.

<p/>At six o'clock, Raffles, having had only fitful perturbed snatches of
sleep, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) waked with fresh restlessness and perpetual cries
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was sinking away, Bulstrode began to administer the opium
according to Lydgate's directions. At the end of half an hour or more
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) called Mrs. Abel and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) found himself unfit for
further watching. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) must now consign the patient to her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) care; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
proceeded to repeat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) Lydgate's directions as to the quantity of
each dose. Mrs. Abel had not before known anything of Lydgate's
prescriptions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) had simply prepared and brought whatever Bulstrode
ordered, and had done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) began now to ask
what else she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) should do besides administering the opium.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing at present, except the offer of the soup or the soda-water:
you can come to me for further directions. Unless there is any
important change, I shall not come into the room again to-night. You
will ask your husband for help if necessary. I must go to bed early.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You've much need, sir, I'm sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Abel/Abel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Abel, <div class="bookquote">``and to take
something more strengthening than what you've done.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Abel/Abel</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode went away now without anxiety as to what Raffles might say in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) raving, which had taken on a muttering incoherence not likely to
create any dangerous belief. At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) must risk this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) went
down into the wainscoted parlor first, and began to consider whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
would not have his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) horse saddled and go home by the moonlight, and give
up caring for earthly consequences. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had begged
Lydgate to come again that evening. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might deliver a
different opinion, and think that Raffles was getting into a less
hopeful state. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) send for Lydgate? If Raffles were really
getting worse, and slowly dying, Bulstrode felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could go to bed
and sleep in gratitude to Providence. But was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) worse? Lydgate might
come and simply say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was going on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) expected, and predict
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would by-and-by fall into a good sleep, and get well. What was
the use of sending for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)? Bulstrode shrank from that result. No
ideas or opinions could hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) from seeing the one probability to
be, that Raffles recovered would be just the same man as before, with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) strength as a tormentor renewed, obliging him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) to drag away his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) wife
to spend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) years apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friends and native place, carrying an
alienating suspicion against him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had sat an hour and a half in this conflict by the firelight only,
when a sudden thought made him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) rise and light the bed-candle, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
had brought down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>). The thought was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had not told Mrs.
Abel when the doses of opium must cease.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) took hold of the candlestick, but stood motionless for a long while.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) might already have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) more than Lydgate had prescribed. But
it was excusable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should forget part of an order, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
present wearied condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked up-stairs, candle in hand, not
knowing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should straightway enter his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own room and go to bed,
or turn to the patient's room and rectify his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) omission. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) paused in
the passage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face turned towards Raffles's room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) could
hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) moaning and murmuring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) was not asleep, then. Who could
know that Lydgate's prescription would not be better disobeyed than
followed, since there was still no sleep?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) turned into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own room. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel
rapped at the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opened it an inch, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>)
speak low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, should I have no brandy nor nothing to give the
poor creetur? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feels sinking away, and nothing else will he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
swaller--and but little strength in it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did--only the opium. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says more and more he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s sinking down through the earth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) surprise, Mr. Bulstrode did not answer. A struggle was going on
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must die for want o' support, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) goes on in that way.
When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I had to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) port-wine
and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Abel/Abel</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Abel, with
a touch of remonstrance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) tone.

<p/>But again Mr. Bulstrode did not answer immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) continued,
<div class="bookquote">``It's not a time to spare when people are at death's door, nor would
you wish it, sir, I'm sure. Else I should give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) our own bottle o'
rum as we keep by us. But a sitter-up so as you've been, and doing
everything as laid in your power--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Here a key was thrust through the inch of doorway, and Mr. Bulstrode
said huskily, <div class="bookquote">``That is the key of the wine-cooler. You will find plenty
of brandy there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Early in the morning--about six--Mr. Bulstrode rose and spent some time
in prayer. Does any one suppose that private prayer is necessarily
candid--necessarily goes to the roots of action? Private prayer is
inaudible speech, and speech is representative: who can represent
himself just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) is, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own reflections? Bulstrode had not
yet unravelled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thought the confused promptings of the last
four-and-twenty hours.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) listened in the passage, and could hear hard stertorous breathing.
Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) walked out in the garden, and looked at the early rime on the
grass and fresh spring leaves. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) re-entered the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt
startled at the sight of Mrs. Abel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is your patient--asleep, I think?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said, with an attempt at
cheerfulness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)'s gone very deep, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Abel/Abel</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Abel. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) went off gradual
between three and four o'clock. Would you please to go and look at
him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)? I thought it no harm to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>). My man's gone afield, and the
little girl's seeing to the kettles.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode went up. At a glance he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knew that Raffles was not in the
sleep which brings revival, but in the sleep which streams deeper and
deeper into the gulf of death.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) looked round the room and saw a bottle with some brandy in it, and
the almost empty opium phial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) put the phial out of sight, and
carried the brandy-bottle down-stairs with him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>), locking it again in the
wine-cooler.

<p/>While breakfasting he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) considered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) should ride to Middlemarch
at once, or wait for Lydgate's arrival. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) decided to wait, and told
Mrs. Abel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) might go about her (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) work--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could watch in the
bed-chamber.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sat there and beheld the enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) peace going irrevocably
into silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt more at rest than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had done for many months.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) conscience was soothed by the enfolding wing of secrecy, which
seemed just then like an angel sent down for his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) relief. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) drew out
his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) pocket-book to review various memoranda there as to the
arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had projected and partly carried out in the prospect of
quitting Middlemarch, and considered how far he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would let them stand or
recall them, now that his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) absence would be brief. Some economies which
he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) felt desirable might still find a suitable occasion in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) temporary
withdrawal from management, and he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) hoped still that Mrs. Casaubon would
take a large share in the expenses of the Hospital. In that way the
moments passed, until a change in the stertorous breathing was marked
enough to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) attention wholly to the bed, and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) to think
of the departing life, which had once been subservient to his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)
own--which he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had once been glad to find base enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) to act on
as he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) would. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) gladness then which impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) now to be
glad that the life was at an end.

<p/>And who could say that the death of Raffles had been hastened? Who
knew what would have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)?

<p/>Lydgate arrived at half-past ten, in time to witness the final pause of
the breath. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) entered the room Bulstrode observed a sudden
expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face, which was not so much surprise as a recognition
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not judged correctly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stood by the bed in silence for
some time, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes turned on the dying man, but with that subdued
activity of expression which showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was carrying on an inward
debate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did this change begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), looking at Bulstrode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not watch by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``I was over-worn,
and left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under Mrs. Abel's care. She (<font color='blue'><b>Abel</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank into sleep
between three and four o'clock. When I came in before eight he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
nearly in this condition.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate did not ask another question, but watched in silence until he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``It's all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This morning Lydgate was in a state of recovered hope and freedom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) old animation, and felt himself
strong enough to bear all the deficiencies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) married life. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was conscious that Bulstrode had been a benefactor to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was
uneasy about this case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not expected it to terminate as it had
done. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hardly knew how to put a question on the subject to
Bulstrode without appearing to insult him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>); and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) examined the
housekeeper--why, the man was dead. There seemed to be no use in
implying that somebody's ignorance or imprudence had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And
after all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself might be wrong.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and Bulstrode rode back to Middlemarch together, talking of many
things--chiefly cholera and the chances of the Reform Bill in the House
of Lords, and the firm resolve of the political Unions. Nothing was
said about Raffles, except that Bulstrode mentioned the necessity of
having a grave for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in Lowick churchyard, and observed that, so far
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) knew, the poor man had no connections, except Rigg, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>) had
stated to be unfriendly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Rigg</b></font>).

<p/>On returning home Lydgate had a visit from Mr. Farebrother. The Vicar
had not been in the town the day before, but the news that there was an
execution in Lydgate's house had got to Lowick by the evening, having
been carried by Mr. Spicer, shoemaker and parish-clerk, who had it from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brother, the respectable bell-hanger in Lowick Gate. Since that
evening when Lydgate had come down from the billiard room with Fred
Vincy, Mr. Farebrother's thoughts about him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had been rather gloomy.
Playing at the Green Dragon once or oftener might have been a trifle in
another man; but in Lydgate it was one of several signs that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
getting unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) former self. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was beginning to do things for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had formerly even an excessive scorn. Whatever certain
dissatisfactions in marriage, which some silly tinklings of gossip had
given him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hints of, might have to do with this change, Mr. Farebrother
felt sure that it was chiefly connected with the debts which were being
more and more distinctly reported, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) began to fear that any notion
of Lydgate's having resources or friends in the background must be
quite illusory. The rebuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had met with in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) first attempt to win
Lydgate's confidence, disinclined him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to a second; but this news of the
execution being actually in the house, determined the Vicar to overcome
his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>) reluctance.

<p/>Lydgate had just dismissed a poor patient, in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was much
interested, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came forward to put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hand--with an open
cheerfulness which surprised Mr. Farebrother. Could this too be a
proud rejection of sympathy and help? Never mind; the sympathy and
help should be offered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How are you, Lydgate? I came to see you because I had heard something
which made me anxious about you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, in the tone of a good
brother, only that there was no reproach in it. They were both seated
by this time, and Lydgate answered immediately--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know what you mean. You had heard that there was an
execution in the house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; is it true?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with an air of freedom, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not
mind talking about the affair now. <div class="bookquote">``But the danger is over; the debt
is paid. I am out of my difficulties now: I shall be freed from debts,
and able, I hope, to start afresh on a better plan.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very thankful to hear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vicar</b></font>)</div>said the Vicar, falling back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vicar</b></font>)
chair, and speaking with that low-toned quickness which often follows
the removal of a load. ``I like that better than all the news in the
``Times.<div class="bookquote">'' I confess I came to you with a heavy heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you for coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, cordially. <div class="bookquote">``I can enjoy the
kindness all the more because I am happier. I have certainly been a
good deal crushed. I'm afraid I shall find the bruises still painful
by-and by,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) added, smiling rather sadly; <div class="bookquote">``but just now I can only
feel that the torture-screw is off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother was silent for a moment, and then said earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``My
dear fellow, let me ask you one question. Forgive me if I take a
liberty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe you will ask anything that ought to offend me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then--this is necessary to set my heart quite at rest--you have
not--have you?--in order to pay your debts, incurred another debt which
may harass you worse hereafter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, coloring slightly. <div class="bookquote">``There is no reason why I
should not tell you--since the fact is so--that the person to whom I am
indebted is Bulstrode. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has made me a very handsome advance--a
thousand pounds--and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) can afford to wait for repayment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, that is generous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, compelling himself to
approve of the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) disliked. His (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) delicate feeling shrank from
dwelling even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) thought on the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had always urged
Lydgate to avoid any personal entanglement with Bulstrode. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) added
immediately, <div class="bookquote">``And Bulstrode must naturally feel an interest in your
welfare, after you have worked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) in a way which has probably
reduced your income instead of adding to it. I am glad to think that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has acted accordingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate felt uncomfortable under these kindly suppositions. They made
more distinct within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the uneasy consciousness which had shown its
first dim stirrings only a few hours before, that Bulstrode's motives
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sudden beneficence following close upon the chillest
indifference might be merely selfish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) let the kindly suppositions
pass. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not tell the history of the loan, but it was more
vividly present with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) than ever, as well as the fact which the Vicar
delicately ignored--that this relation of personal indebtedness to
Bulstrode was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had once been most resolved to avoid.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) began, instead of answering, to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) projected economies,
and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) having come to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life from a different point of
view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall set up a surgery,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I really think I made a mistaken
effort in that respect. And if Rosamond will not mind, I shall take an
apprentice. I don't like these things, but if one carries them out
faithfully they are not really lowering. I have had a severe galling
to begin with: that will make the small rubs seem easy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Lydgate! the <div class="bookquote">``if Rosamond will not mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which had fallen from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) involuntarily as part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, was a significant mark of the
yoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bore. But Mr. Farebrother, whose hopes entered strongly into
the same current with Lydgate's, and who knew nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that
could now raise a melancholy presentiment, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with affectionate
congratulation.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXI.

<p/>Clown... ``Twas in the Bunch of Grapes, where, indeed,
you have a delight to sit, have you not?
Froth. I have so: because it is an open room, and good for winter.
Clo. Why, very well then: I hope here be truths.
--Measure for Measure.


<p/>Five days after the death of Raffles, Mr. Bambridge was standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>)
leisure under the large archway leading into the yard of the Green
Dragon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) was not fond of solitary contemplation, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) had only
just come out of the house, and any human figure standing at ease under
the archway in the early afternoon was as certain to attract
companionship as a pigeon which has found something worth pecking at.
In this case there was no material object to feed upon, but the eye of
reason saw a probability of mental sustenance in the shape of gossip.
Mr. Hopkins, the meek-mannered draper opposite, was the first to act on
this inward vision, being the more ambitious of a little masculine talk
because his (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) customers were chiefly women. Mr. Bambridge was rather
curt to the draper, feeling that Hopkins was of course glad to talk to
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>)_, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) was not going to waste much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hopkins</b></font>) talk on Hopkins.
Soon, however, there was a small cluster of more important listeners,
who were either deposited from the passers-by, or had sauntered to the
spot expressly to see if there were anything going on at the Green
Dragon; and Mr. Bambridge was finding it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) while to say many
impressive things about the fine studs he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had been seeing and the
purchases he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had made on a journey in the north from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) had just
returned. Gentlemen present were assured that when they could show him (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>)
anything to cut out a blood mare, a bay, rising four, which was to be
seen at Doncaster if they chose to go and look at it, Mr. Bambridge
would gratify them by being shot <div class="bookquote">``from here to Hereford.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>Also, a pair
of blacks which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) was going to put into the break recalled vividly to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) mind a pair which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) had sold to Faulkner in '19, for a hundred
guineas, and which Faulkner had sold for a hundred and sixty two months
later--any gent who could disprove this statement being offered the
privilege of calling Mr. Bambridge by a very ugly name until the
exercise made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) throat dry.

<p/>When the discourse was at this point of animation, came up Mr. Frank
Hawley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) was not a man to compromise his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) dignity by lounging at the
Green Dragon, but happening to pass along the High Street and seeing
Bambridge on the other side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) took some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) long strides across to
ask the horsedealer whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had found the first-rate gig-horse which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had engaged to look for. Mr. Hawley was requested to wait until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
had seen a gray selected at Bilkley: if that did not meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) wishes to
a hair, Bambridge did not know a horse when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) saw it, which seemed to
be the highest conceivable unlikelihood. Mr. Hawley, standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
back to the street, was fixing a time for looking at the gray and
seeing it tried, when a horseman passed slowly by.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bulstrode!''  (<font color='red'><b>the draper</b></font>)</div>said two or three voices at once in a low tone, one of
them, which was the draper's, respectfully prefixing the <div class="bookquote">``Mr.;''  (<font color='red'><b>the draper</b></font>)</div>but
nobody having more intention in this interjectural naming than if they
had said <div class="bookquote">``the Riverston coach''  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>when that vehicle appeared in the
distance. Mr. Hawley gave a careless glance round at Bulstrode's back,
but as Bambridge's eyes followed it he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) made a sarcastic grimace.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``By jingo! that reminds me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) began, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) voice a little, <div class="bookquote">``I
picked up something else at Bilkley besides your gig-horse, Mr. Hawley.
I picked up a fine story about Bulstrode. Do you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) came by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) fortune? Any gentleman wanting a bit of curious information, I can
give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) free of expense. If everybody got their deserts, Bulstrode
might have had to say his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) prayers at Botany Bay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
pockets, and pushing a little forward under the archway. If Bulstrode
should turn out to be a rascal, Frank Hawley had a prophetic soul.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had it from a party who was an old chum of Bulstrode's. I'll tell
you where I first picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>said Bambridge, with a sudden gesture
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) fore-finger. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was at Larcher's sale, but I knew nothing of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) then--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) slipped through my fingers--was after Bulstrode, no
doubt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) can tap Bulstrode to any amount, knows all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
secrets. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) blabbed to me at Bilkley: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) takes a stiff glass.
Damme if I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) meant to turn king's evidence; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)'s that sort
of bragging fellow, the bragging runs over hedge and ditch with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>),
till he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)'d brag of a spavin as if it `ud fetch money. A man should know
when to pull up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bambridge made this remark with an air of
disgust, satisfied that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) own bragging showed a fine sense of the

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the man's name? Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be found?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley.

funeral.''  (<font color='red'><b>the listeners</b></font>)</div>There was a strong sensation among the listeners. Mr.
Bambridge gave an ejaculation in which <div class="bookquote">``brimstone''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bambridge/Bambridge</b></font>)</div>was the mildest
word, and Mr. Hawley, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) brows and bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) head forward,
exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``What?--where did the man die?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Stone Court,''  (<font color='red'><b>the draper</b></font>)</div>said the draper. <div class="bookquote">``The housekeeper said he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) was a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it was on Wednesday I took a glass with him (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposed
Bambridge.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did any doctor attend him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Mr. Lydgate. Mr. Bulstrode sat up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) one night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) died
the third morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go on, Bambridge,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, insistently. <div class="bookquote">``What did this
fellow say about Bulstrode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The group had already become larger, the town-clerk's presence being a
guarantee that something worth listening to was going on there; and Mr.
Bambridge delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bambridge</b></font>) narrative in the hearing of seven. It was
mainly what we know, including the fact about Will Ladislaw, with some
local color and circumstance added: it was what Bulstrode had dreaded
the betrayal of--and hoped to have buried forever with the corpse of
Raffles--it was that haunting ghost of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) earlier life which as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
rode past the archway of the Green Dragon he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) was trusting that
Providence had delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) from. Yes, Providence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had not
confessed to himself yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had done anything in the way of
contrivance to this end; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had accepted what seemed to have been
offered. It was impossible to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dragon</b></font>) had done anything which
hastened the departure of that man's soul.

<p/>But this gossip about Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like the
smell of fire. Mr. Frank Hawley followed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) information by sending
a clerk whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring
about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) knowledge
that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) gig; and Mr.
Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) office to ask whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) had time to undertake an arbitration if it
were required, and then asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) incidentally about Raffles. Caleb
was betrayed into no word injurious to Bulstrode beyond the fact which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) was forced to admit, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) had given up acting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) within the
last week. Mr Hawley drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) inferences, and feeling convinced that
Raffles had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) story to Garth, and that Garth had given up
Bulstrode's affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr.
Toller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp
of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from
Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to
be the chief publisher of Bulstrode's misdemeanors.

<p/>Mr. Hawley was not slow to perceive that there was no handle for the
law either in the revelations made by Raffles or in the circumstances
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) death. He (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had himself ridden to Lowick village that he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) might
look at the register and talk over the whole matter with Mr.
Farebrother, who was not more surprised than the lawyer that an ugly
secret should have come to light about Bulstrode, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had always
had justice enough in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to hinder his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) antipathy from turning into
conclusions. But while they were talking another combination was
silently going forward in Mr. Farebrother's mind, which foreshadowed
what was soon to be loudly spoken of in Middlemarch as a necessary
<div class="bookquote">``putting of two and two together.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>With the reasons which kept
Bulstrode in dread of Raffles there flashed the thought that the dread
might have something to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) munificence towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) medical
man; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) resisted the suggestion that it had been consciously
accepted in any way as a bribe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had a foreboding that this
complication of things might be of malignant effect on Lydgate's
reputation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) perceived that Mr. Hawley knew nothing at present of
the sudden relief from debt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) himself was careful to glide away
from all approaches towards the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) said, with a deep breath, wanting to wind up the illimitable
discussion of what might have been, though nothing could be legally
proven, <div class="bookquote">``it is a strange story. So our mercurial Ladislaw has a queer
genealogy! A high-spirited young lady and a musical Polish patriot
made a likely enough stock for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to spring from, but I should never
have suspected a grafting of the Jew pawnbroker. However, there's no
knowing what a mixture will turn out beforehand. Some sorts of dirt
serve to clarify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's just what I should have expected,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, mounting his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
horse. <div class="bookquote">``Any cursed alien blood, Jew, Corsican, or Gypsy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)'s one of your black sheep, Hawley. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) is really a
disinterested, unworldly fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, that is your Whiggish twist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hawley, who had been in
the habit of saying apologetically that Farebrother was such a damned
pleasant good-hearted fellow you would mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) for a Tory.

<p/>Mr. Hawley rode home without thinking of Lydgate's attendance on
Raffles in any other light than as a piece of evidence on the side of
Bulstrode. But the news that Lydgate had all at once become able not
only to get rid of the execution in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) house but to pay all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) debts
in Middlemarch was spreading fast, gathering round it conjectures and
comments which gave it new body and impetus, and soon filling the ears
of other persons besides Mr. Hawley, who were not slow to see a
significant relation between this sudden command of money and
Bulstrode's desire to stifle the scandal of Raffles. That the money
came from Bulstrode would infallibly have been guessed even if there
had been no direct evidence of it; for it had beforehand entered into
the gossip about Lydgate's affairs, that neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) father-in-law nor
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own family would do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and direct evidence was
furnished not only by a clerk at the Bank, but by innocent Mrs.
Bulstrode herself, who mentioned the loan to Mrs. Plymdale, who
mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) daughter-in-law of the house of Toller, who
mentioned it generally. The business was felt to be so public and
important that it required dinners to feed it, and many invitations
were just then issued and accepted on the strength of this scandal
concerning Bulstrode and Lydgate; wives, widows, and single ladies took
their work and went out to tea oftener than usual; and all public
conviviality, from the Green Dragon to Dollop's, gathered a zest which
could not be won from the question whether the Lords would throw out
the Reform Bill.

<p/>For hardly anybody doubted that some scandalous reason or other was at
the bottom of Bulstrode's liberality to Lydgate. Mr. Hawley indeed, in
the first instance, invited a select party, including the two
physicians, with Mr Toller and Mr. Wrench, expressly to hold a close
discussion as to the probabilities of Raffles's illness, reciting to
them all the particulars which had been gathered from Mrs. Abel in
connection with Lydgate's certificate, that the death was due to
delirium tremens; and the medical gentlemen, who all stood
undisturbedly on the old paths in relation to this disease, declared
that they could see nothing in these particulars which could be
transformed into a positive ground of suspicion. But the moral grounds
of suspicion remained: the strong motives Bulstrode clearly had for
wishing to be rid of Raffles, and the fact that at this critical moment
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had given Lydgate the help which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must for some time have known
the need for; the disposition, moreover, to believe that Bulstrode
would be unscrupulous, and the absence of any indisposition to believe
that Lydgate might be as easily bribed as other haughty-minded men when
they have found themselves in want of money. Even if the money had
been given merely to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tongue about the scandal of
Bulstrode's earlier life, the fact threw an odious light on Lydgate,
who had long been sneered at as making himself subservient to the
banker for the sake of working himself into predominance, and
discrediting the elder members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) profession. Hence, in spite of
the negative as to any direct sign of guilt in relation to the death at
Stone Court, Mr. Hawley's select party broke up with the sense that the
affair had <div class="bookquote">``an ugly look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Hawley party</b></font>)</div><p/>But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to
keep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial
professional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power
of mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the
thing was, than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more
confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the
incompatible. Even the more definite scandal concerning Bulstrode's
earlier life was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as
so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such
fantastic shapes as heaven pleased.

<p/>This was the tone of thought chiefly sanctioned by Mrs. Dollop, the
spirited landlady of the Tankard in Slaughter Lane, who had often to
resist the shallow pragmatism of customers disposed to think that their
reports from the outer world were of equal force with what had <div class="bookquote">``come
up''  (<font color='red'><b>customers</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) mind. How it had been brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) didn't know, but
it was there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) as if it had been <div class="bookquote">``scored with the chalk on the
chimney-board--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as Bulstrode should say, <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) inside was _that black_
as if the hairs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) head knowed the thoughts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)'d tear
'em up by the roots.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's odd,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limp</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limp, a meditative shoemaker, with weak eyes and
a piping voice. ``Why, I read in the <div class="bookquote">``Trumpet' that was what the Duke
of Wellington said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) coat and went over to the Romans.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dollop</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dollop. <div class="bookquote">``If one raskill said it, it's more

things with that high hand, as there was no parson i' the country good
enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) was forced to take Old Harry into his (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) counsel, and
Old Harry's been too many for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).''

<div class="bookquote">``But by what I can make out, there's them says Bulstrode was for
running away, for fear o' being found out, before now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)'ll be drove away, whether or no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dill</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Dill, the barber, who
had just dropped in. ``I shaved Fletcher, Hawley's clerk, this
morning--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)'s got a bad finger--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) says they're all of one mind to
get rid of Bulstrode. Mr. Thesiger is turned against him (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>), and wants
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>) out o' the parish. And there's gentlemen in this town says they'd
as soon dine with a fellow from the hulks. ``And a deal sooner I
would,<div class="bookquote">'' says Fletcher; `for what's more against one's stomach than a
man coming and making himself bad company with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) religion, and giving

he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s worse than half the men at the tread-mill?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Fletcher said so
himself.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It'll be a bad thing for the town though, if Bulstrode's money goes
out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Limp</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Limp, quaveringly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, there's better folks spend their money worse,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dyer</b></font>)</div>said a firm-voiced
dyer, whose crimson hands looked out of keeping with his (<font color='blue'><b>Limp</b></font>) good-natured
face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) won't keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) money, by what I can make out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the glazier</b></font>)</div>said the
glazier. <div class="bookquote">``Don't they say as there's somebody can strip it off him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)? By

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No such thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>the barber</b></font>)</div>said the barber, who felt himself a little above his (<font color='blue'><b>barber</b></font>)
company at Dollop's, but liked it none the worse. <div class="bookquote">``Fletcher says it's
no such thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) says they might prove over and over again whose

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look you there now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dollop</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dollop, indignantly. <div class="bookquote">``I thank the Lord

motherless. Then by that, it's o' no use who your father and mother

another--I wonder at a man o' your cleverness, Mr. Dill. It's well
known there's always two sides, if no more; else who'd go to law, I
should like to know? It's a poor tale, with all the law as there is up
and down, if it's no use proving whose child you are. Fletcher may say
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) likes, but I say, don't Fletcher _me_!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dill</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Dill affected to laugh in a complimentary way at Mrs. Dollop, as a
woman who was more than a match for the lawyers; being disposed to
submit to much twitting from a landlady who had a long score against
him (<font color='blue'><b>Dill</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If they come to lawing, and it's all true as folks say, there's more

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dollop</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dollop looked round with the air of a landlady accustomed to
dominate her (<font color='blue'><b>Dollop</b></font>) company. There was a chorus of adhesion from the more
courageous; but Mr. Limp, after taking a draught, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Limp</b></font>) flat hands
together and pressed them hard between his (<font color='blue'><b>Limp</b></font>) knees, looking down at them
with blear-eyed contemplation, as if the scorching power of Mrs.
Dollop's speech had quite dried up and nullified his (<font color='blue'><b>Limp</b></font>) wits until they
could be brought round again by further moisture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why shouldn't they dig the man up and have the Crowner?''  (<font color='red'><b>the dyer</b></font>)</div>said the
dyer. <div class="bookquote">``It's been done many and many's the time. If there's been foul

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not they, Mr. Jonas!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Dollop, emphatically. <div class="bookquote">``I know what
doctors are. They're a deal too cunning to be found out. And this
Doctor Lydgate that's been for cutting up everybody before the breath
was well out o' their body--it's plain enough what use he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wanted to
make o' looking into respectable people's insides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knows drugs, you
may be sure, as you can neither smell nor see, neither before they're
swallowed nor after. Why, I've seen drops myself ordered by Doctor

more live children into the world nor ever another i' Middlemarch--I
say I've seen drops myself as made no difference whether they was in
the glass or out, and yet have griped you the next day. So I'll leave
your own sense to judge. Don't tell me! All I say is, it's a mercy
they didn't take this Doctor Lydgate on to our club. There's many a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The heads of this discussion at <div class="bookquote">``Dollop's''  (<font color='red'><b>Tipton Grange/Grange</b></font>)</div>had been the common theme
among all classes in the town, had been carried to Lowick Parsonage on
one side and to Tipton Grange on the other, had come fully to the ears
of the Vincy family, and had been discussed with sad reference to <div class="bookquote">``poor
Harriet''  (<font color='red'><b>the Vincy family</b></font>)</div>by all Mrs. Bulstrode's friends, before Lydgate knew
distinctly why people were looking strangely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and before
Bulstrode himself suspected the betrayal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) secrets. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not
been accustomed to very cordial relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) neighbors, and hence
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not miss the signs of cordiality; moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been taking
journeys on business of various kinds, having now made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mind that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) need not quit Middlemarch, and feeling able consequently to
determine on matters which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had before left in suspense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will make a journey to Cheltenham in the course of a month or two,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``There are great spiritual advantages to be
had in that town along with the air and the waters, and six weeks there
will be eminently refreshing to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) really believed in the spiritual advantages, and meant that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life
henceforth should be the more devoted because of those later sins which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) represented to himself as hypothetic, praying hypothetically for
their pardon:--<div class="bookquote">``if I have herein transgressed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As to the Hospital, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) avoided saying anything further to Lydgate,
fearing to manifest a too sudden change of plans immediately on the
death of Raffles. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) secret soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) believed that Lydgate
suspected his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) orders to have been intentionally disobeyed, and
suspecting this he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must also suspect a motive. But nothing had been
betrayed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as to the history of Raffles, and Bulstrode was anxious
not to do anything which would give emphasis to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) undefined
suspicions. As to any certainty that a particular method of treatment
would either save or kill, Lydgate himself was constantly arguing
against such dogmatism; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no right to speak, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had every
motive for being silent. Hence Bulstrode felt himself providentially
secured. The only incident he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had strongly winced under had been an
occasional encounter with Caleb Garth, who, however, had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) hat
with mild gravity.

<p/>Meanwhile, on the part of the principal townsmen a strong determination
was growing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>).

<p/>A meeting was to be held in the Town-Hall on a sanitary question which
had risen into pressing importance by the occurrence of a cholera case
in the town. Since the Act of Parliament, which had been hurriedly
passed, authorizing assessments for sanitary measures, there had been a
Board for the superintendence of such measures appointed in
Middlemarch, and much cleansing and preparation had been concurred in
by Whigs and Tories. The question now was, whether a piece of ground
outside the town should be secured as a burial-ground by means of
assessment or by private subscription. The meeting was to be open, and
almost everybody of importance in the town was expected to be there.

<p/>Mr. Bulstrode was a member of the Board, and just before twelve o'clock
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) started from the Bank with the intention of urging the plan of
private subscription. Under the hesitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) projects, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had for
some time kept himself in the background, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should
this morning resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) old position as a man of action and influence
in the public affairs of the town where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) expected to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) days.
Among the various persons going in the same direction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) saw Lydgate;
they joined, talked over the object of the meeting, and entered it
together.

<p/>It seemed that everybody of mark had been earlier than they. But there
were still spaces left near the head of the large central table, and
they made their way thither. Mr. Farebrother sat opposite, not far
from Mr. Hawley; all the medical men were there; Mr. Thesiger was in
the chair, and Mr. Brooke of Tipton was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) right hand.

<p/>Lydgate noticed a peculiar interchange of glances when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and Bulstrode
took their seats.

<p/>After the business had been fully opened by the chairman, who pointed
out the advantages of purchasing by subscription a piece of ground
large enough to be ultimately used as a general cemetery, Mr.
Bulstrode, whose rather high-pitched but subdued and fluent voice the
town was used to at meetings of this sort, rose and asked leave to
deliver his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) opinion. Lydgate could see again the peculiar interchange
of glances before Mr. Hawley started up, and said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) firm resonant
voice, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Chairman, I request that before any one delivers his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
opinion on this point I may be permitted to speak on a question of
public feeling, which not only by myself, but by many gentlemen
present, is regarded as preliminary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Hawley's mode of speech, even when public decorum repressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">``awful language,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>was formidable in its curtness and self-possession.
Mr. Thesiger sanctioned the request, Mr. Bulstrode sat down, and Mr.
Hawley continued.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In what I have to say, Mr. Chairman, I am not speaking simply on my
own behalf: I am speaking with the concurrence and at the express
request of no fewer than eight of my fellow-townsmen, who are
immediately around us. It is our united sentiment that Mr. Bulstrode
should be called upon--and I do now call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)--to resign public
positions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) holds not simply as a tax-payer, but as a gentleman
among gentlemen. There are practices and there are acts which, owing
to circumstances, the law cannot visit, though they may be worse than
many things which are legally punishable. Honest men and gentlemen, if
they don't want the company of people who perpetrate such acts, have
got to defend themselves as they best can, and that is what I and the
friends whom I may call my clients in this affair are determined to do.
I don't say that Mr. Bulstrode has been guilty of shameful acts, but I
call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) either publicly to deny and confute the scandalous
statements made against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) by a man now dead, and who died in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
house--the statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was for many years engaged in nefarious
practices, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune by dishonest procedures--or else
to withdraw from positions which could only have been allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a
gentleman among gentlemen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>All eyes in the room were turned on Mr. Bulstrode, who, since the first
mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) name, had been going through a crisis of feeling almost
too violent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) delicate frame to support. Lydgate, who himself
was undergoing a shock as from the terrible practical interpretation of
some faint augury, felt, nevertheless, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own movement of
resentful hatred was checked by that instinct of the Healer which
thinks first of bringing rescue or relief to the sufferer, when he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>)
looked at the shrunken misery of Bulstrode's livid face.

<p/>The quick vision that his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) life was after all a failure, that he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) was a
dishonored man, and must quail before the glance of those towards whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) had habitually assumed the attitude of a reprover--that God had
disowned him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before men and left him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) unscreened to the triumphant scorn
of those who were glad to have their hatred justified--the sense of
utter futility in that equivocation with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conscience in dealing with
the life of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) accomplice, an equivocation which now turned venomously
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with the full-grown fang of a discovered lie:--all this
rushed through him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like the agony of terror which fails to kill, and
leaves the ears still open to the returning wave of execration. The
sudden sense of exposure after the re-established sense of safety
came--not to the coarse organization of a criminal but to--the
susceptible nerve of a man whose intensest being lay in such mastery
and predominance as the conditions of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life had shaped for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>But in that intense being lay the strength of reaction. Through all
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bodily infirmity there ran a tenacious nerve of ambitious
self-preserving will, which had continually leaped out like a flame,
scattering all doctrinal fears, and which, even while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat an object
of compassion for the merciful, was beginning to stir and glow under
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ashy paleness. Before the last words were out of Mr. Hawley's
mouth, Bulstrode felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should answer, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) answer would
be a retort. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) dared not get up and say, <div class="bookquote">``I am not guilty, the whole
story is false'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had dared this, it would have seemed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) present keen sense of betrayal, as vain as to pull, for
covering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) nakedness, a frail rag which would rend at every little
strain.

<p/>For a few moments there was total silence, while every man in the room
was looking at Bulstrode. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat perfectly still, leaning hard against
the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not venture to rise, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began
to speak he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands upon the seat on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was perfectly audible, though hoarser than usual, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
words were distinctly pronounced, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paused between sentence as
if short of breath. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, turning first toward Mr. Thesiger, and
then looking at Mr. Hawley--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I protest before you, sir, as a Christian minister, against the
sanction of proceedings towards me which are dictated by virulent
hatred. Those who are hostile to me are glad to believe any libel
uttered by a loose tongue against me. And their consciences become
strict against me. Say that the evil-speaking of which I am to be made
the victim accuses me of malpractices--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hawley/Hawley/Mr. Frank Hawley</b></font>)</div>here Bulstrode's voice rose
and took on a more biting accent, till it seemed a low cry--<div class="bookquote">``who shall
be my accuser? Not men whose own lives are unchristian, nay,
scandalous--not men who themselves use low instruments to carry out
their ends--whose profession is a tissue of chicanery--who have been
spending their income on their own sensual enjoyments, while I have
been devoting mine to advance the best objects with regard to this life
and the next.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>After the word chicanery there was a growing noise, half of murmurs and
half of hisses, while four persons started up at once--Mr. Hawley, Mr.
Toller, Mr. Chichely, and Mr. Hackbutt; but Mr. Hawley's outburst was
instantaneous, and left the others behind in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you mean me, sir, I call you and every one else to the inspection
of my professional life. As to Christian or unchristian, I repudiate
your canting palavering Christianity; and as to the way in which I
spend my income, it is not my principle to maintain thieves and cheat
offspring of their due inheritance in order to support religion and set
myself up as a saintly Killjoy. I affect no niceness of conscience--I
have not found any nice standards necessary yet to measure your actions
by, sir. And I again call upon you to enter into satisfactory
explanations concerning the scandals against you, or else to withdraw
from posts in which we at any rate decline you as a colleague. I say,
sir, we decline to co-operate with a man whose character is not cleared
from infamous lights cast upon it, not only by reports but by recent
actions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me, Mr. Hawley,''  (<font color='red'><b>the chairman Hawley</b></font>)</div>said the chairman; and Mr. Hawley, still
fuming, bowed half impatiently, and sat down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) hands thrust deep
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hawley</b></font>) pockets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Bulstrode, it is not desirable, I think, to prolong the present
discussion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thesiger</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Thesiger, turning to the pallid trembling man; <div class="bookquote">``I
must so far concur with what has fallen from Mr. Hawley in expression
of a general feeling, as to think it due to your Christian profession
that you should clear yourself, if possible, from unhappy aspersions.
I for my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and
hearing. But I must say that your present attitude is painfully
inconsistent with those principles which you have sought to identify
yourself with, and for the honor of which I am bound to care. I
recommend you at present, as your clergyman, and one who hopes for your
reinstatement in respect, to quit the room, and avoid further hindrance
to business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>Bulstrode, after a moment's hesitation, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hat from the floor and
slowly rose, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) grasped the corner of the chair so totteringly that
Lydgate felt sure there was not strength enough in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to walk away
without support. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not see a man sink close
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) for want of help. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rose and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm to Bulstrode, and in
that way led him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) out of the room; yet this act, which might have been
one of gentle duty and pure compassion, was at this moment unspeakably
bitter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sign-manual to that
association of himself with Bulstrode, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) now saw the full
meaning as it must have presented itself to other minds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) now felt
the conviction that this man who was leaning tremblingly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm,
had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the thousand pounds as a bribe, and that somehow the
treatment of Raffles had been tampered with from an evil motive. The
inferences were closely linked enough; the town knew of the loan,
believed it to be a bribe, and believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it as a bribe.

<p/>Poor Lydgate, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind struggling under the terrible clutch of this
revelation, was all the while morally forced to take Mr. Bulstrode to
the Bank, send a man off for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) carriage, and wait to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
home.

<p/>Meanwhile the business of the meeting was despatched, and fringed off
into eager discussion among various groups concerning this affair of
Bulstrode--and Lydgate.

<p/>Mr. Brooke, who had before heard only imperfect hints of it, and was
very uneasy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``gone a little too far''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in countenancing
Bulstrode, now got himself fully informed, and felt some benevolent
sadness in talking to Mr. Farebrother about the ugly light in which
Lydgate had come to be regarded. Mr. Farebrother was going to walk
back to Lowick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Step into my carriage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``I am going round to see
Mrs. Casaubon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was to come back from Yorkshire last night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
will like to see me, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>So they drove along, Mr. Brooke chatting with good-natured hope that
there had not really been anything black in Lydgate's behavior--a
young fellow whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had seen to be quite above the common mark, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) brought a letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) uncle Sir Godwin. Mr. Farebrother said
little: he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was deeply mournful: with a keen perception of human
weakness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) could not be confident that under the pressure of
humiliating needs Lydgate had not fallen below himself.

<p/>When the carriage drove up to the gate of the Manor, Dorothea was out
on the gravel, and came to greet them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``we have just come from a meeting--a
sanitary meeting, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Mr. Lydgate there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, who looked full of health and
animation, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head bare under the gleaming April
lights. <div class="bookquote">``I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and have a great consultation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
about the Hospital. I have engaged with Mr. Bulstrode to do so.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, <div class="bookquote">``we have been hearing bad news--bad
news, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked through the garden towards the churchyard gate, Mr.
Farebrother wanting to go on to the parsonage; and Dorothea heard the
whole sad story.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) listened with deep interest, and begged to hear twice over the
facts and impressions concerning Lydgate. After a short silence,
pausing at the churchyard gate, and addressing Mr. Farebrother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
said energetically--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't believe that Mr. Lydgate is guilty of anything base? I will
not believe it. Let us find out the truth and clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)!''





 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>BOOK VIII.





<p/>SUNSET AND SUNRISE.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXII.

<p/>Full souls are double mirrors, making still
An endless vista of fair things before,
Repeating things behind.


<p/>Dorothea's impetuous generosity, which would have leaped at once to the
vindication of Lydgate from the suspicion of having accepted money as a
bribe, underwent a melancholy check when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came to consider all the
circumstances of the case by the light of Mr. Farebrother's experience.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a delicate matter to touch,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``How can we begin to
inquire into it? It must be either publicly by setting the magistrate
and coroner to work, or privately by questioning Lydgate. As to the
first proceeding there is no solid ground to go upon, else Hawley would
have adopted it; and as to opening the subject with Lydgate, I confess
I should shrink from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would probably take it as a deadly insult.
I have more than once experienced the difficulty of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) on
personal matters. And--one should know the truth about his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) conduct
beforehand, to feel very confident of a good result.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I feel convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) conduct has not been guilty: I believe that
people are almost always better than their neighbors think they are,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. Some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) intensest experience in the last two years
had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind strongly in opposition to any unfavorable construction
of others; and for the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt rather discontented with Mr.
Farebrother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) disliked this cautious weighing of consequences,
instead of an ardent faith in efforts of justice and mercy, which would
conquer by their emotional force. Two days afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was dining
at the Manor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle and the Chettams, and when the dessert was
standing uneaten, the servants were out of the room, and Mr. Brooke was
nodding in a nap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) returned to the subject with renewed vivacity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate would understand that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friends hear a calumny about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) their first wish must be to justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). What do we live for, if
it is not to make life less difficult to each other? I cannot be
indifferent to the troubles of a man who advised me in _my_ trouble,
and attended me in my illness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's tone and manner were not more energetic than they had been
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was at the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle's table nearly three years
before, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience since had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more right to express a
decided opinion. But Sir James Chettam was no longer the diffident and
acquiescent suitor: he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) was the anxious brother-in-law, with a devout
admiration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) sister, but with a constant alarm lest she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should
fall under some new illusion almost as bad as marrying Casaubon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
smiled much less; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Exactly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it was more often an
introduction to a dissentient opinion than in those submissive bachelor
days; and Dorothea found to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had to resolve not to
be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>)--all the more because he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) was really her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) best friend.
He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) disagreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Dorothea,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) said, remonstrantly, <div class="bookquote">``you can't undertake to manage
a man's life for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that way. Lydgate must know--at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will
soon come to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stands. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) can clear himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
must act for himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friends must wait till they find an opportunity,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>added
Mr. Farebrother. <div class="bookquote">``It is possible--I have often felt so much weakness
in myself that I can conceive even a man of honorable disposition, such
as I have always believed Lydgate to be, succumbing to such a
temptation as that of accepting money which was offered more or less
indirectly as a bribe to insure his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) silence about scandalous facts long
gone by. I say, I can conceive this, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were under the pressure of
hard circumstances--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been harassed as I feel sure Lydgate has
been. I would not believe anything worse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) except under stringent
proof. But there is the terrible Nemesis following on some errors,
that it is always possible for those who like it to interpret them into
a crime: there is no proof in favor of the man outside his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
consciousness and assertion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how cruel!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``And would you not
like to be the one person who believed in that man's innocence, if the
rest of the world belied him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Besides, there is a man's character
beforehand to speak for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, my dear Mrs. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, smiling gently at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ardor, <div class="bookquote">``character is not cut in marble--it is not something solid
and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become
diseased as our bodies do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then it may be rescued and healed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea <div class="bookquote">``I should not be
afraid of asking Mr. Lydgate to tell me the truth, that I might help
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Why should I be afraid? Now that I am not to have the land,
James, I might do as Mr. Bulstrode proposed, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) place in
providing for the Hospital; and I have to consult Mr. Lydgate, to know
thoroughly what are the prospects of doing good by keeping up the
present plans. There is the best opportunity in the world for me to
ask for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) confidence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would be able to tell me things which
might make all the circumstances clear. Then we would all stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) trouble. People glorify all sorts of bravery
except the bravery they might show on behalf of their nearest
neighbors.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea's eyes had a moist brightness in them, and the
changed tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle, who began to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true that a woman may venture on some efforts of sympathy which
would hardly succeed if we men undertook them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother,
almost converted by Dorothea's ardor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, a woman is bound to be cautious and listen to those who know
the world better than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does.''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) little
frown. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you do in the end, Dorothea, you should really keep
back at present, and not volunteer any meddling with this Bulstrode
business. We don't know yet what may turn up. You must agree with
me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ended, looking at Mr. Farebrother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do think it would be better to wait,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the latter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, not quite knowing at what point
the discussion had arrived, but coming up to it with a contribution
which was generally appropriate. <div class="bookquote">``It is easy to go too far, you know.
You must not let your ideas run away with you. And as to being in a
hurry to put money into schemes--it won't do, you know. Garth has
drawn me in uncommonly with repairs, draining, that sort of thing: I'm
uncommonly out of pocket with one thing or another. I must pull up.

round your demesne.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea, submitting uneasily to this discouragement, went with Celia
into the library, which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) usual drawing-room.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXIII.

<p/>Pity the laden one; this wandering woe
May visit you and me.


<p/>When Lydgate had allayed Mrs. Bulstrode's anxiety by telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband had been seized with faintness at the meeting, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
trusted soon to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better and would call again the next day,
unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went directly home, got on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
horse, and rode three miles out of the town for the sake of being out
of reach.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt himself becoming violent and unreasonable as if raging under
the pain of stings: he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was ready to curse the day on which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come
to Middlemarch. Everything that bad happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) there seemed a
mere preparation for this hateful fatality, which had come as a blight
on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) honorable ambition, and must make even people who had only
vulgar standards regard his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) reputation as irrevocably damaged. In such
moments a man can hardly escape being unloving. Lydgate thought of
himself as the sufferer, and of others as the agents who had injured
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had meant everything to turn out differently; and others
had thrust themselves into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life and thwarted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) purposes. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
marriage seemed an unmitigated calamity; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was afraid of going to
Rosamond before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had vented himself in this solitary rage, lest the
mere sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should exasperate him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) behave
unwarrantably. There are episodes in most men's lives in which their
highest qualities can only cast a deterring shadow over the objects
that fill their inward vision: Lydgate's tenderheartedness was present
just then only as a dread lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should offend against it, not as an
emotion that swayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to tenderness. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was very miserable.
Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life--the life
which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it--can
understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into
the absorbing soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.

<p/>How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to live on without vindicating himself among people who
suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) of baseness? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) go silently away from
Middlemarch as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were retreating before a just condemnation? And
yet how was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to set about vindicating himself?

<p/>For that scene at the meeting, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had just witnessed, although it
had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) no particulars, had been enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own situation
thoroughly clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Bulstrode had been in dread of scandalous
disclosures on the part of Raffles. Lydgate could now construct all
the probabilities of the case. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was afraid of some betrayal in my
hearing: all he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wanted was to bind me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) by a strong obligation:
that was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) passed on a sudden from hardness to liberality. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
may have tampered with the patient--he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) may have disobeyed my orders. I
fear he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did. But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) did or not, the world believes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
somehow or other poisoned the man and that I winked at the crime, if I
didn't help in it. And yet--and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) may not be guilty of the last
offence; and it is just possible that the change towards me may have
been a genuine relenting--the effect of second thoughts such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
alleged. What we call the `just possible' is sometimes true and the
thing we find it easier to believe is grossly false. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) last
dealings with this man Bulstrode may have kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hands pure, in spite
of my suspicion to the contrary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a benumbing cruelty in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) position. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) renounced
every other consideration than that of justifying himself--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) met
shrugs, cold glances, and avoidance as an accusation, and made a public
statement of all the facts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew them, who would be convinced? It
would be playing the part of a fool to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own testimony on
behalf of himself, and say, <div class="bookquote">``I did not take the money as a bribe.''  (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div>The
circumstances would always be stronger than his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) assertion. And
besides, to come forward and tell everything about himself must include
declarations about Bulstrode which would darken the suspicions of
others against him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) must tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had not known of Raffles's
existence when he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) first mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pressing need of money to
Bulstrode, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) took the money innocently as a result of that
communication, not knowing that a new motive for the loan might have
arisen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) being called in to this man. And after all, the
suspicion of Bulstrode's motives might be unjust.

<p/>But then came the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should have acted in precisely
the same way if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not taken the money? Certainly, if Raffles had
continued alive and susceptible of further treatment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) arrived,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had then imagined any disobedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) orders on the part of
Bulstrode, he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) would have made a strict inquiry, and if his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) conjecture
had been verified he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) would have thrown up the case, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>)
recent heavy obligation. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) had not received any money--if
Bulstrode had never revoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) cold recommendation of bankruptcy--would
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), Lydgate, have abstained from all inquiry even on finding the
man dead?--would the shrinking from an insult to Bulstrode--would the
dubiousness of all medical treatment and the argument that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
treatment would pass for the wrong with most members of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
profession--have had just the same force or significance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?

<p/>That was the uneasy corner of Lydgate's consciousness while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
reviewing the facts and resisting all reproach. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been
independent, this matter of a patient's treatment and the distinct rule
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must do or see done that which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) believed best for the life
committed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), would have been the point on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have been
the sturdiest. As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had rested in the consideration that
disobedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) orders, however it might have arisen, could not be
considered a crime, that in the dominant opinion obedience to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
orders was just as likely to be fatal, and that the affair was simply
one of etiquette. Whereas, again and again, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) time of freedom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had denounced the perversion of pathological doubt into moral doubt and
had said--<div class="bookquote">``the purest experiment in treatment may still be
conscientious: my business is to take care of life, and to do the best
I can think of for it. Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma.
Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a
contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alas! the
scientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money
obligation and selfish respects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there a medical man of them all in Middlemarch who would question
himself as I do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said poor Lydgate, with a renewed outburst of
rebellion against the oppression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lot. <div class="bookquote">``And yet they will all
feel warranted in making a wide space between me and them, as if I were
a leper! My practice and my reputation are utterly damned--I can see
that. Even if I could be cleared by valid evidence, it would make
little difference to the blessed world here. I have been set down as
tainted and should be cheapened to them all the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Already there had been abundant signs which had hitherto puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>),
that just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been paying off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) debts and getting cheerfully
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) feet, the townsmen were avoiding him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) or looking strangely at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and in two instances it came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knowledge that patients of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had called in another practitioner. The reasons were too plain now.
The general black-balling had begun.

<p/>No wonder that in Lydgate's energetic nature the sense of a hopeless
misconstruction easily turned into a dogged resistance. The scowl
which occasionally showed itself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) square brow was not a
meaningless accident. Already when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was re-entering the town after
that ride taken in the first hours of stinging pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mind on remaining in Middlemarch in spite of the worst that could be
done against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would not retreat before calumny, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
submitted to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would face it to the utmost, and no act of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
should show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was afraid. It belonged to the generosity as well
as defiant force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) nature that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) resolved not to shrink from
showing to the full his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sense of obligation to Bulstrode. It was true
that the association with this man had been fatal to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--true that if
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had the thousand pounds still in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debts
unpaid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have returned the money to Bulstrode, and taken beggary
rather than the rescue which had been sullied with the suspicion of a
bribe -LRB-for, remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of the proudest among the sons of
men-RRB---nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not turn away from this crushed
fellow-mortal whose aid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had used, and make a pitiful effort to get
acquittal for himself by howling against another. <div class="bookquote">``I shall do as I
think right, and explain to nobody. They will try to starve me out,
but--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going on with an obstinate resolve, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was getting
near home, and the thought of Rosamond urged itself again into that
chief place from which it had been thrust by the agonized struggles of
wounded honor and pride.

<p/>How would Rosamond take it all? Here was another weight of chain to
drag, and poor Lydgate was in a bad mood for bearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) dumb mastery.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no impulse to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) the trouble which must soon be common to
them both. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) preferred waiting for the incidental disclosure which
events must soon bring about.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mercifully grant that we may grow aged together.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--BOOK OF TOBIT: Marriage Prayer.


<p/>In Middlemarch a wife could not long remain ignorant that the town held
a bad opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband. No feminine intimate might carry her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
friendship so far as to make a plain statement to the wife of the
unpleasant fact known or believed about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband; but when a woman
with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts much at leisure got them suddenly employed on
something grievously disadvantageous to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbors, various moral
impulses were called into play which tended to stimulate utterance.
Candor was one. To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant, to
use an early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not
take a cheerful view of their capacity, their conduct, or their
position; and a robust candor never waited to be asked for its opinion.
Then, again, there was the love of truth--a wide phrase, but meaning in
this relation, a lively objection to seeing a wife look happier than
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's character warranted, or manifest too much satisfaction in
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lot--the poor thing should have some hint given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
knew the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have less complacency in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bonnet, and in
light dishes for a supper-party. Stronger than all, there was the
regard for a friend's moral improvement, sometimes called her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) soul,
which was likely to be benefited by remarks tending to gloom, uttered
with the accompaniment of pensive staring at the furniture and a manner
implying that the speaker would not tell what was on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind, from
regard to the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hearer. On the whole, one might say that
an ardent charity was at work setting the virtuous mind to make a
neighbor unhappy for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good.

<p/>There were hardly any wives in Middlemarch whose matrimonial
misfortunes would in different ways be likely to call forth more of
this moral activity than Rosamond and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aunt Bulstrode. Mrs.
Bulstrode was not an object of dislike, and had never consciously
injured any human being. Men had always thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) a handsome
comfortable woman, and had reckoned it among the signs of Bulstrode's
hypocrisy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had chosen a red-blooded Vincy, instead of a ghastly
and melancholy person suited to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) low esteem for earthly pleasure.
When the scandal about her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) husband was disclosed they remarked of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor woman! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s as honest as the day--_she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_ never
suspected anything wrong in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), you may depend on it.''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>Women, who
were intimate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>), talked together much of <div class="bookquote">``poor Harriet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>imagined what her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) feelings must be when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) came to know everything,
and conjectured how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had already come to know. There was no
spiteful disposition towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>); rather, there was a busy benevolence
anxious to ascertain what it would be well for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) to feel and do under
the circumstances, which of course kept the imagination occupied with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) character and history from the times when she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) was Harriet Vincy
till now. With the review of Mrs. Bulstrode and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) position it was
inevitable to associate Rosamond, whose prospects were under the same
blight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) aunt's. Rosamond was more severely criticised and less
pitied, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) too, as one of the good old Vincy family who had
always been known in Middlemarch, was regarded as a victim to marriage
with an interloper. The Vincys had their weaknesses, but then they lay
on the surface: there was never anything bad to be <div class="bookquote">``found out''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>concerning them. Mrs. Bulstrode was vindicated from any resemblance to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband. Harriet's faults were her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has always been showy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt, making tea for a small
party, <div class="bookquote">``though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has got into the way of putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) religion
forward, to conform to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) husband; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has tried to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) head up
above Middlemarch by making it known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) invites clergymen and
heaven-knows-who from Riverston and those places.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a party</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can hardly blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sprague</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sprague; <div class="bookquote">``because few of
the best people in the town cared to associate with Bulstrode, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
must have somebody to sit down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) table.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sprague</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Thesiger has always countenanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt. <div class="bookquote">``I

Mrs. Tom Toller. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Thesiger never goes into extremes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thesiger</b></font>) keeps to
the truth in what is evangelical. It is only clergymen like Mr. Tyke,
who want to use Dissenting hymn-books and that low kind of religion,

Mr. Bulstrode, and Harriet Vincy was my friend long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) married

wrong, poor thing. Still, in point of religion, I must say, Mr.
Bulstrode might have done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) has, and worse, and yet have been a
man of no religion. I don't say that there has not been a little too
much of that--I like moderation myself. But truth is truth. The men
tried at the assizes are not all over-religious, I suppose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt, wheeling adroitly, <div class="bookquote">``all I can say is, that

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, we shall see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose
she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knows nothing yet, poor creature. I do hope and trust I shall not
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), for I should be frightened to death lest I should say anything
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) husband. Do you think any hint has reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hardly think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Mrs. Tom Toller/Toller</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Tom Toller. <div class="bookquote">``We hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is
ill, and has never stirred out of the house since the meeting on
Thursday; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) girls at church yesterday, and they had
new Tuscan bonnets. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own had a feather in it. I have never seen
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) religion made any difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wears very neat patterns always,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale, a little

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sprague</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sprague. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody supposes that Mr. Lydgate
can go on holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head in Middlemarch, things look so black
about the thousand pounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) took just at that man's death. It really
makes one shudder.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pride must have a fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not so sorry for Rosamond Vincy that was as I am for her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) aunt,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) needed a lesson.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose the Bulstrodes will go and live abroad somewhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sprague</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a most deadly blow it will be to Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale.
<div class="bookquote">``If ever a woman was crushed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will be. I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from my heart.
And with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faults, few women are better. From a girl she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the
neatest ways, and was always good-hearted, and as open as the day. You
might look into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drawers when you would--always the same. And so
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has brought up Kate and Ellen. You may think how hard it will be
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) to go among foreigners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The doctor says that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should recommend the Lydgates to do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sprague</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sprague. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) says Lydgate ought to have kept among the
French.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That would suit _her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)_ well enough, I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Plymdale;
<div class="bookquote">``there is that kind of lightness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) got that from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
mother; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) never got it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) aunt Bulstrode, who always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>)
good advice, and to my knowledge would rather have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ellen</b></font>) marry
elsewhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Plymdale/Plymdale</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Plymdale was in a situation which caused her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) some complication of
feeling. There had been not only her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) intimacy with Mrs. Bulstrode, but
also a profitable business relation of the great Plymdale dyeing house
with Mr. Bulstrode, which on the one hand would have inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) to
desire that the mildest view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) character should be the true one,
but on the other, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) the more afraid of seeming to palliate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
culpability. Again, the late alliance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) family with the Tollers
had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) in connection with the best circle, which gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>)
in every direction except in the inclination to those serious views
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) believed to be the best in another sense. The sharp little
woman's conscience was somewhat troubled in the adjustment of these
opposing <div class="bookquote">``bests,''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) griefs and satisfactions under late
events, which were likely to humble those who needed humbling, but also
to fall heavily on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old friend whose faults she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have preferred
seeing on a background of prosperity.

<p/>Poor Mrs. Bulstrode, meanwhile, had been no further shaken by the
oncoming tread of calamity than in the busier stirring of that secret
uneasiness which had always been present in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) since the last visit of
Raffles to The Shrubs. That the hateful man had come ill to Stone
Court, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband had chosen to remain there and watch over
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) allowed to be explained by the fact that Raffles had been
employed and aided in earlier-days, and that this made a tie of
benevolence towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) degraded helplessness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had been
since then innocently cheered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's more hopeful speech
about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own health and ability to continue his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attention to business.
The calm was disturbed when Lydgate had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) home ill from the
meeting, and in spite of comforting assurances during the next few
days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) cried in private from the conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband was not
suffering from bodily illness merely, but from something that afflicted
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and scarcely to sit
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), alleging nervous susceptibility to sounds and movements; yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) suspected that in shutting himself up in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) private room he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wanted
to be busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) papers. Something, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt sure, had happened.
Perhaps it was some great loss of money; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was kept in the dark.
Not daring to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said to Lydgate, on the fifth
day after the meeting, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not left home except to go to
church--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Lydgate, pray be open with me: I like to know the truth. Has
anything happened to Mr. Bulstrode?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some little nervous shock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, evasively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt that it
was not for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to make the painful revelation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But what brought it on?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, looking directly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) large dark eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is often something poisonous in the air of public rooms,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``Strong men can stand it, but it tells on people in
proportion to the delicacy of their systems. It is often impossible to
account for the precise moment of an attack--or rather, to say why the
strength gives way at a particular moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bulstrode was not satisfied with this answer. There remained in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) the belief that some calamity had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband, of which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was to be kept in ignorance; and it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) nature strongly to
object to such concealment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) begged leave for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) daughters to sit
with their father, and drove into the town to pay some visits,
conjecturing that if anything were known to have gone wrong in Mr.
Bulstrode's affairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should see or hear some sign of it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) called on Mrs. Thesiger, who was not at home, and then drove to
Mrs. Hackbutt's on the other side of the churchyard. Mrs. Hackbutt saw
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) coming from an up-stairs window, and remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) former alarm
lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) should meet Mrs. Bulstrode, felt almost bound in consistency
to send word that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was not at home; but against that, there was a
sudden strong desire within her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) for the excitement of an interview in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was quite determined not to make the slightest allusion to
what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) mind.

<p/>Hence Mrs. Bulstrode was shown into the drawing-room, and Mrs. Hackbutt
went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>), with more tightness of lip and rubbing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) hands than
was usually observable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>), these being precautions adopted against
freedom of speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) was resolved not to ask how Mr. Bulstrode was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been anywhere except to church for nearly a week,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Bulstrode, after a few introductory remarks. <div class="bookquote">``But Mr. Bulstrode
was taken so ill at the meeting on Thursday that I have not liked to
leave the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hackbutt rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other
held against her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) chest, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) eyes ramble over the pattern on the
rug.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was Mr. Hackbutt at the meeting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>persevered Mrs. Bulstrode.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt, with the same attitude. <div class="bookquote">``The land
is to be bought by subscription, I believe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hope that there will be no more cases of cholera to be buried
in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``It is an awful visitation. But I always
think Middlemarch a very healthy spot. I suppose it is being used to
it from a child; but I never saw the town I should like to live at
better, and especially our end.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I should be glad that you always should live at Middlemarch,
Mrs. Bulstrode,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Hackbutt, with a slight sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Still, we
must learn to resign ourselves, wherever our lot may be cast. Though I
am sure there will always be people in this town who will wish you
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hackbutt longed to say, <div class="bookquote">``if you take my advice you will part from
your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hackbutt</b></font>)</div>but it seemed clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) that the poor woman knew
nothing of the thunder ready to bolt on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) herself could
do no more than prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) a little. Mrs. Bulstrode felt suddenly
rather chill and trembling: there was evidently something unusual
behind this speech of Mrs. Hackbutt's; but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) had set out with
the desire to be fully informed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) found herself unable now to pursue
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) brave purpose, and turning the conversation by an inquiry about the
young Hackbutts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) soon took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) leave saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) was going to
see Mrs. Plymdale. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) way thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) tried to imagine that there
might have been some unusually warm sparring at the meeting between Mr.
Bulstrode and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) frequent opponents--perhaps Mr. Hackbutt
might have been one of them. That would account for everything.

<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) was in conversation with Mrs. Plymdale that comforting
explanation seemed no longer tenable. <div class="bookquote">``Selina''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>received her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) with a
pathetic affectionateness and a disposition to give edifying answers on
the commonest topics, which could hardly have reference to an ordinary
quarrel of which the most important consequence was a perturbation of
Mr. Bulstrode's health. Beforehand Mrs. Bulstrode had thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
would sooner question Mrs. Plymdale than any one else; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) found to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) surprise that an old friend is not always the person whom it is
easiest to make a confidant of: there was the barrier of remembered
communication under other circumstances--there was the dislike of
being pitied and informed by one who had been long wont to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
the superiority. For certain words of mysterious appropriateness that
Mrs. Plymdale let fall about her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) resolution never to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) back on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Plymdale</b></font>) friends, convinced Mrs. Bulstrode that what had happened must be
some kind of misfortune, and instead of being able to say with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
native directness, <div class="bookquote">``What is it that you have in your mind?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) found
herself anxious to get away before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had heard anything more
explicit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) began to have an agitating certainty that the misfortune
was something more than the mere loss of money, being keenly sensitive
to the fact that Selina now, just as Mrs. Hackbutt had done before,
avoided noticing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) husband, as they would have
avoided noticing a personal blemish.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) said good-by with nervous haste, and told the coachman to drive to
Mr. Vincy's warehouse. In that short drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) dread gathered so much
force from the sense of darkness, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) entered the private
counting-house where her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) brother sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) desk, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) knees trembled
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) usually florid face was deathly pale. Something of the same
effect was produced in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seat
to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) by the hand, and said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) impulsive
rashness--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``God help you, Harriet! you know all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>That moment was perhaps worse than any which came after. It contained
that concentrated experience which in great crises of emotion reveals
the bias of a nature, and is prophetic of the ultimate act which will
end an intermediate struggle. Without that memory of Raffles she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) might
still have thought only of monetary ruin, but now along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>)
brother's look and words there darted into her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) mind the idea of some
guilt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) husband--then, under the working of terror came the image
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) husband exposed to disgrace--and then, after an instant of
scorching shame in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) felt only the eyes of the world, with one
leap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side in mournful but unreproaching
fellowship with shame and isolation. All this went on within her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) in a
mere flash of time--while she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) sank into the chair, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) eyes
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) brother, who stood over her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing, Walter. What is
it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) said, faintly.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) everything, very inartificially, in slow fragments, making
her (<font color='blue'><b>Hackbutt</b></font>) aware that the scandal went much beyond proof, especially as to the
end of Raffles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``People will talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Even if a man has been acquitted by a
jury, they'll talk, and nod and wink--and as far as the world goes, a
man might often as well be guilty as not. It's a breakdown blow, and
it damages Lydgate as much as Bulstrode. I don't pretend to say what
is the truth. I only wish we had never heard the name of either
Bulstrode or Lydgate. You'd better have been a Vincy all your life,
and so had Rosamond.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bulstrode made no reply.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People don't blame
_you_. And I'll stand by you whatever you make up your mind to do,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>said the brother, with rough but well-meaning affectionateness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode. <div class="bookquote">``I
feel very weak.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) got home she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was obliged to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) daughter, <div class="bookquote">``I am not
well, my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your papa. Leave me
in quiet. I shall take no dinner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) locked herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) needed time to get used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
maimed consciousness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) poor lopped life, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could walk
steadily to the place allotted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). A new searching light had fallen
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband's character, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not judge him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) leniently: the
twenty years in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had believed in him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) and venerated him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by
virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) concealments came back with particulars that made them
seem an odious deceit. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had married her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) with that bad past life
hidden behind him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had no faith left to protest his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) innocence
of the worst that was imputed to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) honest ostentatious nature
made the sharing of a merited dishonor as bitter as it could be to any
mortal.

<p/>But this imperfectly taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd
patchwork, had a loyal spirit within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). The man whose prosperity she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly
cherished her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--now that punishment had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) it was not possible
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in any sense to forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There is a forsaking which still
sits at the same board and lies on the same couch with the forsaken
soul, withering it the more by unloving proximity. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
locked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) door, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should unlock it ready to go down to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
unhappy husband and espouse his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sorrow, and say of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) guilt, I will
mourn and not reproach. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) needed time to gather up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strength;
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) needed to sob out her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) farewell to all the gladness and pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
life. When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had resolved to go down, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prepared herself by some
little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had begun a new life in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) embraced humiliation. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off
all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brushed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair down
and put on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) look suddenly like an
early Methodist.

<p/>Bulstrode, who knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife had been out and had come in saying
that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal to
hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) learning the truth from others, and
had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) than any
confession. But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) imagined the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knowledge come,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) awaited the result in anguish. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) daughters had been obliged to
consent to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had allowed some food to be brought
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had not touched it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt himself perishing slowly in
unpitied misery. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) should never see his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife's face with
affection in it again. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) turned to God there seemed to be no
answer but the pressure of retribution.

<p/>It was eight o'clock in the evening before the door opened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife
entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) dared not look up at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes bent down,
and as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) looked smaller--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) seemed
so withered and shrunken. A movement of new compassion and old
tenderness went through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like a great wave, and putting one hand on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) which rested on the arm of the chair, and the other on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, solemnly but kindly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look up, Nicholas.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) eyes with a little start and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) half amazed
for a moment: her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pale face, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) changed, mourning dress, the trembling
about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mouth, all said, <div class="bookquote">``I know;''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands and eyes rested
gently on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) burst out crying and they cried together, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
sitting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) side. They could not yet speak to each other of the
shame which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was bearing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>), or of the acts which had brought
it down on them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) confession was silent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) promise of
faithfulness was silent. Open-minded as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nevertheless
shrank from the words which would have expressed their mutual
consciousness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have shrunk from flakes of fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could
not say, <div class="bookquote">``How much is only slander and false suspicion?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) did not
say, <div class="bookquote">``I am innocent.''

<p/>Rosamond had a gleam of returning cheerfulness when the house was freed
from the threatening figure, and when all the disagreeable creditors
were paid. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was not joyous: her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) married life had fulfilled none
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hopes, and had been quite spoiled for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) imagination. In this
brief interval of calm, Lydgate, remembering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had often been
stormy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hours of perturbation, and mindful of the pain Rosamond
had had to bear, was carefully gentle towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), too, had
lost some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) old spirit, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) still felt it necessary to refer to
an economical change in their way of living as a matter of course,
trying to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to it gradually, and repressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) answered by wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would go to live in London. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
did not make this answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) listened languidly, and wondered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had that was worth living for. The hard and contemptuous words which
had fallen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anger had deeply offended that
vanity which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had at first called into active enjoyment; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
regarded as his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) perverse way of looking at things, kept up a secret
repulsion, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) receive all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tenderness as a poor
substitute for the happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had failed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). They were at a
disadvantage with their neighbors, and there was no longer any outlook
towards Quallingham--there was no outlook anywhere except in an
occasional letter from Will Ladislaw. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had felt stung and
disappointed by Will's resolution to quit Middlemarch, for in spite of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew and guessed about his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) admiration for Dorothea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
secretly cherished the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had, or would necessarily come to
have, much more admiration for herself; Rosamond being one of those
women who live much in the idea that each man they meet would have
preferred them if the preference had not been hopeless. Mrs. Casaubon
was all very well; but Will's interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) dated before he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) knew Mrs.
Lydgate. Rosamond took his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) way of talking to herself, which was a
mixture of playful fault-finding and hyperbolical gallantry, as the
disguise of a deeper feeling; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt that
agreeable titillation of vanity and sense of romantic drama which
Lydgate's presence had no longer the magic to create. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) even
fancied--what will not men and women fancy in these matters?--that
Will exaggerated his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) admiration for Mrs. Casaubon in order to pique
herself. In this way poor Rosamond's brain had been busy before Will's
departure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would have made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thought, a much more suitable
husband for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had found in Lydgate. No notion could have
been falser than this, for Rosamond's discontent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) marriage was
due to the conditions of marriage itself, to its demand for
self-suppression and tolerance, and not to the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband;
but the easy conception of an unreal Better had a sentimental charm
which diverted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) ennui. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) constructed a little romance which was
to vary the flatness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life: Will Ladislaw was always to be a
bachelor and live near her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), always to be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) command, and have an
understood though never fully expressed passion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), which would be
sending out lambent flames every now and then in interesting scenes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) departure had been a proportionate disappointment, and had sadly
increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) weariness of Middlemarch; but at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had the
alternative dream of pleasures in store from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) intercourse with the
family at Quallingham. Since then the troubles of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) married life had
deepened, and the absence of other relief encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) regretful
rumination over that thin romance which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had once fed on. Men and
women make sad mistakes about their own symptoms, taking their vague
uneasy longings, sometimes for genius, sometimes for religion, and
oftener still for a mighty love. Will Ladislaw had written chatty
letters, half to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and half to Lydgate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had replied: their
separation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt, was not likely to be final, and the change she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
now most longed for was that Lydgate should go to live in London;
everything would be agreeable in London; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had set to work with
quiet determination to win this result, when there came a sudden,
delightful promise which inspirited her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/>It came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town-hall, and was
nothing less than a letter from Will Ladislaw to Lydgate, which turned
indeed chiefly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) new interest in plans of colonization, but
mentioned incidentally, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might find it necessary to pay a visit
to Middlemarch within the next few weeks--a very pleasant necessity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
said, almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hoped there was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) old place on the rug, and a great deal of music in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was quite uncertain as to the time. While Lydgate was reading
the letter to Rosamond, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face looked like a reviving flower--it grew
prettier and more blooming. There was nothing unendurable now: the
debts were paid, Mr. Ladislaw was coming, and Lydgate would be
persuaded to leave Middlemarch and settle in London, which was <div class="bookquote">``so
different from a provincial town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>That was a bright bit of morning. But soon the sky became black over
poor Rosamond. The presence of a new gloom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, about which
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was entirely reserved towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)--for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) dreaded to expose his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
lacerated feeling to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) neutrality and misconception--soon received a
painfully strange explanation, alien to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) previous notions of
what could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) happiness. In the new gayety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spirits,
thinking that Lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual,
causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) remarks unanswered, and evidently to keep out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) way as much as possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) chose, a few days after the
meeting, and without speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) on the subject, to send out notes
of invitation for a small evening party, feeling convinced that this
was a judicious step, since people seemed to have been keeping aloof
from them, and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse. When
the invitations had been accepted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would tell Lydgate, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
neighbors; for Rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about
other people's duties. But all the invitations were declined, and the
last answer came into Lydgate's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is Chichely's scratch. What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Chichely</b></font>) writing to you about?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said
Lydgate, wonderingly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) handed the note to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was obliged to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) see it, and, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) severely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me,
Rosamond? I beg, I insist that you will not invite any one to this
house. I suppose you have been inviting others, and they have refused
too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you hear me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>thundered Lydgate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, certainly I hear you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) head aside with
the movement of a graceful long-necked bird.

<p/>Lydgate tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) head without any grace and walked out of the room,
feeling himself dangerous. Rosamond's thought was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was getting
more and more unbearable--not that there was any new special reason for
this peremptoriness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) indisposition to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) anything in which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was sure beforehand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would not be interested was growing
into an unreflecting habit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in ignorance of everything
connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) uncle Bulstrode. Lydgate's odious humors and their neighbors'
apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in their
relief from money difficulties. If the invitations had been accepted
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have gone to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mamma and the rest, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had seen
nothing of for several days; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) now put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) bonnet to go and
inquire what had become of them all, suddenly feeling as if there were
a conspiracy to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in isolation with a husband disposed to
offend everybody. It was after the dinner hour, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
father and mother seated together alone in the drawing-room. They
greeted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with sad looks, saying <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father look so downcast; and seating herself near
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is there anything the matter, papa?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not answer, but Mrs. Vincy said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, have you heard
nothing? It won't be long before it reaches you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it anything about Tertius?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, turning pale. The idea
of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been
unaccountable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, my dear, yes. To think of your marrying into this trouble. Debt
was bad enough, but this will be worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, stay, Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy. <div class="bookquote">``Have you heard nothing about your
uncle Bulstrode, Rosamond?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the poor thing, feeling as if trouble were not
anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had before experienced, but some invisible power with an
iron grasp that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) soul faint within her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) everything, saying at the end, <div class="bookquote">``It's better for you
to know, my dear. I think Lydgate must leave the town. Things have
gone against him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) couldn't help it. I don't accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
of any harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) had always before been disposed to
find the utmost fault with Lydgate.

<p/>The shock to Rosamond was terrible. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) that no lot could
be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the
centre of infamous suspicions. In many cases it is inevitable that the
shame is felt to be the worst part of crime; and it would have required
a great deal of disentangling reflection, such as had never entered
into Rosamond's life, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in these moments to feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) trouble
was less than if her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband had been certainly known to have done
something criminal. All the shame seemed to be there. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
innocently married this man with the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family were
a glory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) usual reticence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) parents, and
only said, that if Lydgate had done as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have left
Middlemarch long ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) bears it beyond anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mother when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was gone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Vincy, who was much broken down.

<p/>But Rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
husband. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really done--how had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really acted? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did
not know. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) everything? He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
on the subject, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It came into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) go home again;
but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>): a
married woman gone back to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) parents--life seemed to have
no meaning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in such a position: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could not contemplate
herself in it.

<p/>The next two days Lydgate observed a change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and believed that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had heard the bad news. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) about it, or would
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) guilty? We must remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in a morbid state of
mind, in which almost all contact was pain. Certainly Rosamond in this
case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) part; but in the bitterness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) excused himself;--was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), since now
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew the truth she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had no impulse to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)? But a
deeper-lying consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in fault made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) restless, and
the silence between them became intolerable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>); it was as if they
were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I am a fool. Haven't I given up expecting anything? I
have married care, not help.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And that evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rosamond, have you heard anything that distresses you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) answered, laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) work, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been carrying
on with a languid semi-consciousness, most unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) usual self.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have you heard?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everything, I suppose. Papa told me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That people think me disgraced?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, faintly, beginning to sew again automatically.

<p/>There was silence. Lydgate thought, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) has any trust in me--any
notion of what I am, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) ought to speak now and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) does not
believe I have deserved disgrace.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>But Rosamond on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) side went on moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fingers languidly.
Whatever was to be said on the subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) expected to come from
Tertius. What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) know? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were innocent of any wrong, why
did he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) not do something to clear himself?

<p/>This silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in
which Lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)--even Farebrother had not come forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had begun to question
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill
fog which had gathered between them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) resolution checked
by despairing resentment. Even this trouble, like the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) seemed
to regard as if it were hers alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was always to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) a being
apart, doing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) objected to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) started from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) chair with an
angry impulse, and thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) pockets, walked up and
down the room. There was an underlying consciousness all the while
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) should have to master this anger, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) everything, and
convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) of the facts. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had almost learned the lesson that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) must bend himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) nature, and that because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) came short in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sympathy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) must give the more. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) recurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) intention
of opening himself: the occasion must not be lost. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) could bring
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be
met and not run away from, and that the whole trouble had come out of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) desperate want of money, it would be a moment for urging powerfully
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little
money as possible, so that they might weather the bad time and keep
themselves independent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) would mention the definite measures which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) desired to take, and win her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to a willing spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) was bound to
try this--and what else was there for him (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) to do?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) did not know how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) had been walking uneasily backwards and
forwards, but Rosamond felt that it was long, and wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) would
sit down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on
Tertius what he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) ought to do. Whatever might be the truth about all
this misery, there was one dread which asserted itself.

<p/>Lydgate at last seated himself, not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) usual chair, but in one
nearer to Rosamond, leaning aside in it towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
gravely before he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) reopened the sad subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had conquered himself
so far, and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity, as on an
occasion which was not to be repeated. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had even opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) lips,
when Rosamond, letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands fall, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely, Tertius--''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in
Middlemarch. I cannot go on living here. Let us go to London. Papa,
and every one else, says you had better go. Whatever misery I have to
put up with, it will be easier away from here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate felt miserably jarred. Instead of that critical outpouring for
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had prepared himself with effort, here was the old round to be
gone through again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not bear it. With a quick change of
countenance he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rose and went out of the room.

<p/>Perhaps if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been strong enough to persist in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) determination to
be the more because she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was less, that evening might have had a better
issue. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) energy could have borne down that check, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might still
have wrought on Rosamond's vision and will. We cannot be sure that any
natures, however inflexible or peculiar, will resist this effect from a
more massive being than their own. They may be taken by storm and for
the moment converted, becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in
the ardor of its movement. But poor Lydgate had a throbbing pain
within him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) energy had fallen short of its task.

<p/>The beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as
ever; nay, it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort.
They lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart, Lydgate
going about what work he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had in a mood of despair, and Rosamond
feeling, with some justification, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was behaving cruelly. It was
of no use to say anything to Tertius; but when Will Ladislaw came, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
was determined to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) everything. In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) general
reticence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) needed some one who would recognize her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) wrongs.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXVI.

<p/>``To mercy, pity, peace, and love
All pray in their distress,
And to these virtues of delight,
Return their thankfulness.
... .
For Mercy has a human heart,
Pity a human face;
And Love, the human form divine;
And Peace, the human dress.
--WILLIAM BLAKE: Songs of Innocence.


<p/>Some days later, Lydgate was riding to Lowick Manor, in consequence of
a summons from Dorothea. The summons had not been unexpected, since it
had followed a letter from Mr. Bulstrode, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
had resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) arrangements for quitting Middlemarch, and must remind
Lydgate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) previous communications about the Hospital, to the
purport of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) still adhered. It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) duty, before taking
further steps, to reopen the subject with Mrs. Casaubon, who now
wished, as before, to discuss the question with Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``Your views
may possibly have undergone some change,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>wrote Mr. Bulstrode; <div class="bookquote">``but, in
that case also, it is desirable that you should lay them before her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea awaited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) arrival with eager interest. Though, in deference
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) masculine advisers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had refrained from what Sir James had
called <div class="bookquote">``interfering in this Bulstrode business,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>the hardship of
Lydgate's position was continually in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind, and when Bulstrode
applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) again about the hospital, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that the opportunity
was come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been hindered from hastening. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
luxurious home, wandering under the boughs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own great trees, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
thought was going out over the lot of others, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) emotions were
imprisoned. The idea of some active good within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) reach, <div class="bookquote">``haunted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) like a passion,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and another's need having once come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as a
distinct image, preoccupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) desire with the yearning to give
relief, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own ease tasteless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was full of confident
hope about this interview with Lydgate, never heeding what was said of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) personal reserve; never heeding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was a very young woman.
Nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to Dorothea than insistence
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) youth and sex when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was moved to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) human fellowship.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat waiting in the library, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could do nothing but live
through again all the past scenes which had brought Lydgate into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
memories. They all owed their significance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage and its
troubles--but no; there were two occasions in which the image of
Lydgate had come painfully in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife and some one
else. The pain had been allayed for Dorothea, but it had left in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
an awakened conjecture as to what Lydgate's marriage might be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), a
susceptibility to the slightest hint about Mrs. Lydgate. These
thoughts were like a drama to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes bright, and gave
an attitude of suspense to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) whole frame, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was only looking
out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds
which stood in relief against the dark evergreens.

<p/>When Lydgate came in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was almost shocked at the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) face,
which was strikingly perceptible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) who had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) for two
months. It was not the change of emaciation, but that effect which
even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of
resentment and despondency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cordial look, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), softened his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) expression, but only with melancholy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have wished very much to see you for a long while, Mr. Lydgate,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea when they were seated opposite each other; <div class="bookquote">``but I put off
asking you to come until Mr. Bulstrode applied to me again about the
Hospital. I know that the advantage of keeping the management of it
separate from that of the Infirmary depends on you, or, at least, on
the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your
control. And I am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you
think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the
Hospital,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot conscientiously advise you to do it
in dependence on any activity of mine. I may be obliged to leave the
town.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spoke curtly, feeling the ache of despair as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) being able to
carry out any purpose that Rosamond had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind against.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not because there is no one to believe in you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, pouring
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) words in clearness from a full heart. <div class="bookquote">``I know the unhappy
mistakes about you. I knew them from the first moment to be mistakes.
You have never done anything vile. You would not do anything
dishonorable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the first assurance of belief in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that had fallen on
Lydgate's ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) drew a deep breath, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could
say no more: it was something very new and strange in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life that
these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beseech you to tell me how everything was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
fearlessly. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure that the truth would clear you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate started up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) chair and went towards the window,
forgetting where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had so often gone over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind the
possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances
that would tell, perhaps unfairly, against Bulstrode, and had so often
decided against it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had so often said to himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) assertions
would not change people's impressions--that Dorothea's words sounded
like a temptation to do something which in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) soberness he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
pronounced to be unreasonable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with simple earnestness; <div class="bookquote">``then we can
consult together. It is wicked to let people think evil of any one
falsely, when it can be hindered.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate turned, remembering where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was, and saw Dorothea's face
looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with a sweet trustful gravity. The presence of a
noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes
the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger,
quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in
the wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on
Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is
dragged and struggling amid the throng. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) sat down again, and felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) old self in the consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
with one who believed in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to bear hard on Bulstrode, who has lent me
money of which I was in need--though I would rather have gone without
it now. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is hunted down and miserable, and has only a poor thread of
life in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). But I should like to tell you everything. It will be a
comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand, and where I
shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty. You will
feel what is fair to another, as you feel what is fair to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do trust me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea; <div class="bookquote">``I will not repeat anything without your
leave. But at the very least, I could say that you have made all the
circumstances clear to me, and that I know you are not in any way
guilty. Mr. Farebrother would believe me, and my uncle, and Sir James
Chettam. Nay, there are persons in Middlemarch to whom I could go;
although they don't know much of me, they would believe me. They would
know that I could have no other motive than truth and justice. I would
take any pains to clear you. I have very little to do. There is
nothing better that I can do in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) made this childlike picture of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would
do, might have been almost taken as a proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could do it
effectively. The searching tenderness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) woman's tones seemed made
for a defence against ready accusers. Lydgate did not stay to think
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was Quixotic: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) gave himself up, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
life, to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous
sympathy, without any check of proud reserve. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
everything, from the time when, under the pressure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) difficulties,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) unwillingly made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) first application to Bulstrode; gradually, in
the relief of speaking, getting into a more thorough utterance of what
had gone on in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) mind--entering fully into the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
doubts at the last, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ideal of medical duty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) uneasy
consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) private inclination and professional behavior, though not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has come to my knowledge since,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that Hawley sent some
one to examine the housekeeper at Stone Court, and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
gave the patient all the opium in the phial I left, as well as a good
deal of brandy. But that would not have been opposed to ordinary
prescriptions, even of first-rate men. The suspicions against me had
no hold there: they are grounded on the knowledge that I took money,
that Bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die, and that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other
against the patient--that in any case I accepted a bribe to hold my
tongue. They are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately,
because they lie in people's inclination and can never be disproved.
How my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which I don't know
the answer. It is still possible that Bulstrode was innocent of any
criminal intention--even possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had nothing to do with the
disobedience, and merely abstained from mentioning it. But all that
has nothing to do with the public belief. It is one of those cases on
which a man is condemned on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character--it is
believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has committed a crime in some undefined way, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the motive for doing it; and Bulstrode's character has enveloped
me, because I took his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) money. I am simply blighted--like a damaged
ear of corn--the business is done and can't be undone.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, it is hard!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I understand the difficulty there is
in your vindicating yourself. And that all this should have come to
you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find
out better ways--I cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable. I know
you meant that. I remember what you said to me when you first spoke to
me about the hospital. There is no sorrow I have thought more about
than that--to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, feeling that here he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had found room for the full
meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) grief. <div class="bookquote">``I had some ambition. I meant everything to be
different with me. I thought I had more strength and mastery. But the
most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, meditatively,--<div class="bookquote">``suppose we kept on the
Hospital according to the present plan, and you stayed here though only
with the friendship and support of a few, the evil feeling towards you
would gradually die out; there would come opportunities in which people
would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you,
because they would see that your purposes were pure. You may still win
a great fame like the Louis and Laennec I have heard you speak of, and
we shall all be proud of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ended, with a smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That might do if I had my old trust in myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate,
mournfully. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round
and running away before this slander, leaving it unchecked behind me.
Still, I can't ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan
which depends on me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be quite worth my while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, simply. <div class="bookquote">``Only
think. I am very uncomfortable with my money, because they tell me I
have too little for any great scheme of the sort I like best, and yet I
have too much. I don't know what to do. I have seven hundred a-year
of my own fortune, and nineteen hundred a-year that Mr. Casaubon left
me, and between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank. I
wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which I
don't want, to buy land with and found a village which should be a
school of industry; but Sir James and my uncle have convinced me that
the risk would be too great. So you see that what I should most
rejoice at would be to have something good to do with my money: I
should like it to make other people's lives better to them. It makes
me very uneasy--coming all to me who don't want it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>A smile broke through the gloom of Lydgate's face. The childlike
grave-eyed earnestness with which Dorothea said all this was
irresistible--blent into an adorable whole with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ready understanding
of high experience. -LRB-Of lower experience such as plays a great part in
the world, poor Mrs. Casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted
knowledge, little helped by her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) imagination.-RRB- But she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) took the smile as
encouragement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) said, in a
tone of persuasion. <div class="bookquote">``The hospital would be one good; and making your
life quite whole and well again would be another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate's smile had died away. <div class="bookquote">``You have the goodness as well as the
money to do all that; if it could be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hesitated a little while, looking vaguely towards the window; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) sat in silent expectation. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) and said
impetuously--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I not tell you?--you know what sort of bond marriage is.
You will understand everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart beginning to beat faster. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that sorrow
too? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feared to say any word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went on immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is impossible for me now to do anything--to take any step without
considering my wife's happiness. The thing that I might like to do if
I were alone, is become impossible to me. I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) miserable.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) married me without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going into, and it might
have been better for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not married me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I know--you could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pain, if you were not obliged
to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with keen memory of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own life.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind against staying. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wishes to go. The
troubles she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has had here have wearied her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, breaking off
again, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should say too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw the good that might come of staying--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
remonstrantly, looking at Lydgate as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had forgotten the reasons
which had just been considered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did not speak immediately.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not see it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said at last, curtly, feeling at first that
this statement must do without explanation. <div class="bookquote">``And, indeed, I have lost
all spirit about carrying on my life here.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) paused a moment and
then, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the
difficulty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``The fact is, this trouble has come
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) confusedly. We have not been able to speak to each other
about it. I am not sure what is in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind about it: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may fear
that I have really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be
more open. But I have been suffering cruelly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May I go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, eagerly. <div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) accept my
sympathy? I would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that you have not been blamable before any
one's judgment but your own. I would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that you shall be
cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart. Will you ask her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
if I may go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? I did see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you may,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, seizing the proposition with some
hope. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would feel honored--cheered, I think, by the proof that you
at least have some respect for me. I will not speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) about your
coming--that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) may not connect it with my wishes at all. I know very
well that I ought not to have left anything to be told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by others,
but--''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) broke off, and there was a moment's silence. Dorothea refrained
from saying what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind--how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew that there might be
invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife. This was a
point on which even sympathy might make a wound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) returned to the
more outward aspect of Lydgate's position, saying cheerfully--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if Mrs. Lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in
you and support you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might then be glad that you should stay in
your place and recover your hopes--and do what you meant to do.
Perhaps then you would see that it was right to agree with what I
proposed about your continuing at the Hospital. Surely you would, if
you still have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate did not answer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was debating with himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not decide immediately,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, gently. <div class="bookquote">``A few days hence
it will be early enough for me to send my answer to Mr. Bulstrode.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>Lydgate still waited, but at last turned to speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) most decisive
tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering. I am
no longer sure enough of myself--I mean of what it would be possible
for me to do under the changed circumstances of my life. It would be
dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in
dependence on me. I might be obliged to go away after all; I see
little chance of anything else. The whole thing is too problematic; I
cannot consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted. No--let
the new Hospital be joined with the old Infirmary, and everything go on
as it might have done if I had never come. I have kept a valuable
register since I have been there; I shall send it to a man who will
make use of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) ended bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``I can think of nothing for a long
while but getting an income.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.
<div class="bookquote">``It would be a happiness to your friends, who believe in your future,
in your power to do great things, if you would let them save you from
that. Think how much money I have; it would be like taking a burthen
from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this
fettering want of income. Why should not people do these things? It
is so difficult to make shares at all even. This is one way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Mrs. Casaubon!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, rising as if with the
same impulse that made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) words energetic, and resting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm on the
back of the great leather chair he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had been sitting in. <div class="bookquote">``It is good
that you should have such feelings. But I am not the man who ought to
allow himself to benefit by them. I have not given guarantees enough.
I must not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for
work that I never achieved. It is very clear to me that I must not
count on anything else than getting away from Middlemarch as soon as I
can manage it. I should not be able for a long while, at the very
best, to get an income here, and--and it is easier to make necessary
changes in a new place. I must do as other men do, and think what will
please the world and bring in money; look for a little opening in the
London crowd, and push myself; set up in a watering-place, or go to
some southern town where there are plenty of idle English, and get
myself puffed,--that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to
keep my soul alive in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now that is not brave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,--<div class="bookquote">``to give up the fight.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it is not brave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, <div class="bookquote">``but if a man is afraid of
creeping paralysis?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Then, in another tone, <div class="bookquote">``Yet you have made a great
difference in my courage by believing in me. Everything seems more
bearable since I have talked to you; and if you can clear me in a few
other minds, especially in Farebrother's, I shall be deeply grateful.
The point I wish you not to mention is the fact of disobedience to my
orders. That would soon get distorted. After all, there is no
evidence for me but people's opinion of me beforehand. You can only
repeat my own report of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Farebrother will believe--others will believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``I
can say of you what will make it stupidity to suppose that you would be
bribed to do a wickedness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, with something like a groan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) voice.
<div class="bookquote">``I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery
which is sometimes called prosperity. You will do me another great
kindness, then, and come to see my wife?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will. I remember how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, into whose
mind every impression about Rosamond had cut deep. <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will
like me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div><p/>As Lydgate rode away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``This young creature has a heart
large enough for the Virgin Mary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) evidently thinks nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
own future, and would pledge away half her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) income at once, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
wanted nothing for herself but a chair to sit in from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can
look down with those clear eyes at the poor mortals who pray to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seems to have what I never saw in any woman before--a fountain of
friendship towards men--a man can make a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). Casaubon must
have raised some heroic hallucination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could
have any other sort of passion for a man? Ladislaw?--there was
certainly an unusual feeling between them. And Casaubon must have had
a notion of it. Well--her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) love might help a man more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) side had immediately formed a plan of relieving Lydgate
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) obligation to Bulstrode, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt sure was a part,
though small, of the galling pressure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had to bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat down at
once under the inspiration of their interview, and wrote a brief note,
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pleaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had more claim than Mr. Bulstrode had to
the satisfaction of providing the money which had been serviceable to
Lydgate--that it would be unkind in Lydgate not to grant her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the
position of being his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) helper in this small matter, the favor being
entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) who had so little that was plainly marked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) superfluous money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) might call her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) a creditor or by
any other name if it did but imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) granted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) request. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
enclosed a check for a thousand pounds, and determined to take the
letter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the next day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went to see Rosamond.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXVII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>--Henry V.


<p/>The next day Lydgate had to go to Brassing, and told Rosamond that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
should be away until the evening. Of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had never gone beyond
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own house and garden, except to church, and once to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) papa,
to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If Tertius goes away, you will help us to move, will
you not, papa? I suppose we shall have very little money. I am sure I
hope some one will help us.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Mr. Vincy had said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, child, I
don't mind a hundred or two. I can see the end of that.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Vincy/Vincy</b></font>)</div>With these
exceptions she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had sat at home in languid melancholy and suspense,
fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind on Will Ladislaw's coming as the one point of hope and
interest, and associating this with some new urgency on Lydgate to make
immediate arrangements for leaving Middlemarch and going to London,
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt assured that the coming would be a potent cause of the
going, without at all seeing how. This way of establishing sequences
is too common to be fairly regarded as a peculiar folly in Rosamond.
And it is precisely this sort of sequence which causes the greatest
shock when it is sundered: for to see how an effect may be produced is
often to see possible missings and checks; but to see nothing except
the desirable cause, and close upon it the desirable effect, rids us of
doubt and makes our minds strongly intuitive. That was the process
going on in poor Rosamond, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) arranged all objects around her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
with the same nicety as ever, only with more slowness--or sat down to
the piano, meaning to play, and then desisting, yet lingering on the
music stool with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) white fingers suspended on the wooden front, and
looking before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in dreamy ennui. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) melancholy had become so
marked that Lydgate felt a strange timidity before it, as a perpetual
silent reproach, and the strong man, mastered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keen sensibilities
towards this fair fragile creature whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed somehow to have
bruised, shrank from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) look, and sometimes started at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) approach,
fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) rushing in only the more forcibly after it
had been momentarily expelled by exasperation.

<p/>But this morning Rosamond descended from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) room upstairs--where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
sometimes sat the whole day when Lydgate was out--equipped for a walk
in the town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had a letter to post--a letter addressed to Mr.
Ladislaw and written with charming discretion, but intended to hasten
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) arrival by a hint of trouble. The servant-maid, their sole
house-servant now, noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) coming down-stairs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) walking dress,
and thought <div class="bookquote">``there never did anybody look so pretty in a bonnet poor
thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The servant-maid</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile Dorothea's mind was filled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) project of going to
Rosamond, and with the many thoughts, both of the past and the probable
future, which gathered round the idea of that visit. Until yesterday
when Lydgate had opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) a glimpse of some trouble in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) married
life, the image of Mrs. Lydgate had always been associated for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with
that of Will Ladislaw. Even in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) most uneasy moments--even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had been agitated by Mrs. Cadwallader's painfully graphic report of
gossip--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) effort, nay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) strongest impulsive prompting, had been
towards the vindication of Will from any sullying surmises; and when,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had at first interpreted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
words as a probable allusion to a feeling towards Mrs. Lydgate which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
was determined to cut himself off from indulging, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had had a quick,
sad, excusing vision of the charm there might be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) constant
opportunities of companionship with that fair creature, who most likely
shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) other tastes as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) evidently did his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) delight in music. But
there had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) parting words--the few passionate words in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had implied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) herself was the object of whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) love
held him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) in dread, that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) only which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was
resolved not to declare but to carry away into banishment. From the
time of that parting, Dorothea, believing in Will's love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
believing with a proud delight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) delicate sense of honor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
determination that no one should impeach him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) justly, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart
quite at rest as to the regard he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) might have for Mrs. Lydgate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
sure that the regard was blameless.

<p/>There are natures in which, if they love us, we are conscious of having
a sort of baptism and consecration: they bind us over to rectitude and
purity by their pure belief about us; and our sins become that worst
kind of sacrilege which tears down the invisible altar of trust. <div class="bookquote">``If
you are not good, none is good'' (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>--those little words may give a
terrific meaning to responsibility, may hold a vitriolic intensity for
remorse.

<p/>Dorothea's nature was of that kind: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own passionate faults lay along
the easily counted open channels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) ardent character; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
was full of pity for the visible mistakes of others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not yet
any material within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience for subtle constructions and
suspicions of hidden wrong. But that simplicity of hers, holding up an
ideal for others in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) believing conception of them, was one of the
great powers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) womanhood. And it had from the first acted
strongly on Will Ladislaw. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), that the
brief words by which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had tried to convey to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) feeling about
herself and the division which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fortune made between them, would
only profit by their brevity when Dorothea had to interpret them: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
felt that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had found his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) highest estimate.

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was right there. In the months since their parting Dorothea had
felt a delicious though sad repose in their relation to each other, as
one which was inwardly whole and without blemish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had an active
force of antagonism within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), when the antagonism turned on the
defence either of plans or persons that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) believed in; and the wrongs
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt that Will had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband, and the
external conditions which to others were grounds for slighting him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),
only gave the more tenacity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) affection and admiring judgment.
And now with the disclosures about Bulstrode had come another fact
affecting Will's social position, which roused afresh Dorothea's inward
resistance to what was said about him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) in that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) world which
lay within park palings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young Ladislaw the grandson of a thieving Jew pawnbroker''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>was a phrase
which had entered emphatically into the dialogues about the Bulstrode
business, at Lowick, Tipton, and Freshitt, and was a worse kind of
placard on poor Will's back than the <div class="bookquote">``Italian with white mice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>Upright Sir James Chettam was convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) own satisfaction was
righteous when he (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) thought with some complacency that here was an added
league to that mountainous distance between Ladislaw and Dorothea,
which enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) to dismiss any anxiety in that direction as too
absurd. And perhaps there had been some pleasure in pointing Mr.
Brooke's attention to this ugly bit of Ladislaw's genealogy, as a fresh
candle for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own folly by. Dorothea had observed the
animus with which Will's part in the painful story had been recalled
more than once; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had uttered no word, being checked now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had not been formerly in speaking of Will, by the consciousness of a
deeper relation between them which must always remain in consecrated
secrecy. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) silence shrouded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resistant emotion into a more
thorough glow; and this misfortune in Will's lot which, it seemed,
others were wishing to fling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) back as an opprobrium, only gave
something more of enthusiasm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clinging thought.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) entertained no visions of their ever coming into nearer union, and
yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had taken no posture of renunciation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
whole relation to Will very simply as part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) marriage sorrows, and
would have thought it very sinful in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to keep up an inward wail
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not completely happy, being rather disposed to dwell on
the superfluities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could bear that the chief pleasures
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) tenderness should lie in memory, and the idea of marriage came
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) solely as a repulsive proposition from some suitor of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
at present knew nothing, but whose merits, as seen by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) friends,
would be a source of torment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>):--<div class="bookquote">``somebody who will manage your
property for you, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Brooke's attractive suggestion of
suitable characteristics. <div class="bookquote">``I should like to manage it myself, if I
knew what to do with it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. No--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) adhered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
declaration that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would never be married again, and in the long
valley of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life which looked so flat and empty of waymarks, guidance
would come as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked along the road, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fellow-passengers
by the way.

<p/>This habitual state of feeling about Will Ladislaw had been strong in
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) waking hours since she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had proposed to pay a visit to Mrs.
Lydgate, making a sort of background against which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw Rosamond's
figure presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) without hindrances to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) interest and
compassion. There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier
to complete confidence which had arisen between this wife and the
husband who had yet made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) happiness a law to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). That was a
trouble which no third person must directly touch. But Dorothea
thought with deep pity of the loneliness which must have come upon
Rosamond from the suspicions cast on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband; and there would
surely be help in the manifestation of respect for Lydgate and sympathy
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>thought Dorothea, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
being driven towards the town. The clear spring morning, the scent of
the moist earth, the fresh leaves just showing their creased-up wealth
of greenery from out their half-opened sheaths, seemed part of the
cheerfulness she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was feeling from a long conversation with Mr.
Farebrother, who had joyfully accepted the justifying explanation of
Lydgate's conduct. <div class="bookquote">``I shall take Mrs. Lydgate good news, and perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will like to talk to me and make a friend of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea had another errand in Lowick Gate: it was about a new
fine-toned bell for the school-house, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had to get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
carriage very near to Lydgate's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked thither across the street,
having told the coachman to wait for some packages. The street door
was open, and the servant was taking the opportunity of looking out at
the carriage which was pausing within sight when it became apparent to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) that the lady who <div class="bookquote">``belonged to it''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>was coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Mrs. Lydgate at home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not sure, my lady; I'll see, if you'll please to walk in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>said
Martha, a little confused on the score of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) kitchen apron, but
collected enough to be sure that <div class="bookquote">``mum''  (<font color='red'><b>Martha</b></font>)</div>was not the right title for this
queenly young widow with a carriage and pair. <div class="bookquote">``Will you please to walk
in, and I'll go and see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say that I am Mrs. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, as Martha moved forward
intending to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) into the drawing-room and then to go up-stairs to
see if Rosamond had returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) walk.

<p/>They crossed the broader part of the entrance-hall, and turned up the
passage which led to the garden. The drawing-room door was unlatched,
and Martha, pushing it without looking into the room, waited for Mrs.
Casaubon to enter and then turned away, the door having swung open and
swung back again without noise.

<p/>Dorothea had less of outward vision than usual this morning, being
filled with images of things as they had been and were going to be.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found herself on the other side of the door without seeing anything
remarkable, but immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heard a voice speaking in low tones
which startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as with a sense of dreaming in daylight, and
advancing unconsciously a step or two beyond the projecting slab of a
bookcase, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw, in the terrible illumination of a certainty which
filled up all outlines, something which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pause, motionless,
without self-possession enough to speak.

<p/>Seated with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) on a sofa which stood against the wall
on a line with the door by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw Will
Ladislaw: close by him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with a flushed
tearfulness which gave a new brilliancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face sat Rosamond, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
bonnet hanging back, while Will leaning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clasped both her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
upraised hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and spoke with low-toned fervor.

<p/>Rosamond in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) agitated absorption had not noticed the silently
advancing figure; but when Dorothea, after the first immeasurable
instant of this vision, moved confusedly backward and found herself
impeded by some piece of furniture, Rosamond was suddenly aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
presence, and with a spasmodic movement snatched away her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands and
rose, looking at Dorothea who was necessarily arrested. Will Ladislaw,
starting up, looked round also, and meeting Dorothea's eyes with a new
lightning in them, seemed changing to marble: But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) immediately
turned them away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to Rosamond and said in a firm voice--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, Mrs. Lydgate, the servant did not know that you were here.
I called to deliver an important letter for Mr. Lydgate, which I wished
to put into your own hands.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) laid down the letter on the small table which had checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
retreat, and then including Rosamond and Will in one distant glance and
bow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went quickly out of the room, meeting in the passage the
surprised Martha, who said she (<font color='blue'><b>Martha</b></font>) was sorry the mistress was not at home,
and then showed the strange lady out with an inward reflection that
grand people were probably more impatient than others.

<p/>Dorothea walked across the street with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) most elastic step and was
quickly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) carriage again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drive on to Freshitt Hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to the coachman, and any one
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have thought that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was paler than usual
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was never animated by a more self-possessed energy. And that was
really her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) experience. It was as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had drunk a great draught of
scorn that stimulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) beyond the susceptibility to other feelings.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had seen something so far below her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) belief, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) emotions
rushed back from it and made an excited throng without an object. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
needed something active to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) excitement out upon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt
power to walk and work for a day, without meat or drink. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would
carry out the purpose with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had started in the morning, of
going to Freshitt and Tipton to tell Sir James and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) uncle all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wished them to know about Lydgate, whose married loneliness under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) trial now presented itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with new significance, and made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more ardent in readiness to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) champion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had never felt
anything like this triumphant power of indignation in the struggle of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) married life, in which there had always been a quickly subduing
pang; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) took it as a sign of new strength.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dodo, how very bright your eyes are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, when Sir James was
gone out of the room. <div class="bookquote">``And you don't see anything you look at, Arthur
or anything. You are going to do something uncomfortable, I know. Is
it all about Mr. Lydgate, or has something else happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>Celia had
been used to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister with expectation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear, a great many things have happened,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodo</b></font>)</div>said Dodo, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) full
tones.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) arms cozily and leaning
forward upon them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all the troubles of all people on the face of the earth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) arms to the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me, Dodo, are you going to have a scheme for them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, a
little uneasy at this Hamlet-like raving.

<p/>But Sir James came in again, ready to accompany Dorothea to the Grange,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) expedition well, not swerving in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resolution
until she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) descended at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own door.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXVIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would it were yesterday and I i' the grave,
With her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) sweet faith above for monument''


 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond and Will stood motionless--they did not know how long--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
looking towards the spot where Dorothea had stood, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looking
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) with doubt. It seemed an endless time to Rosamond, in
whose inmost soul there was hardly so much annoyance as gratification
from what had just happened. Shallow natures dream of an easy sway
over the emotions of others, trusting implicitly in their own petty
magic to turn the deepest streams, and confident, by pretty gestures
and remarks, of making the thing that is not as though it were. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
knew that Will had received a severe blow, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been little used
to imagining other people's states of mind except as a material cut
into shape by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own wishes; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) believed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own power to
soothe or subdue. Even Tertius, that most perverse of men, was always
subdued in the long-run: events had been obstinate, but still Rosamond
would have said now, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) marriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never
gave up what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) mind on.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) arm and laid the tips of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fingers on Will's
coat-sleeve.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) said, with an utterance like the cut of a lash,
darting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and changing from pink to white and back again, as if
his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) whole frame were tingling with the pain of the sting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) wheeled
round to the other side of the room and stood opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), with the
tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head thrown back, looking
fiercely not at Rosamond but at a point a few inches away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was keenly offended, but the Signs she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) made of this were such as
only Lydgate was used to interpret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) became suddenly quiet and
seated herself, untying her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hanging bonnet and laying it down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
shawl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) little hands which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) folded before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) were very cold.

<p/>It would have been safer for Will in the first instance to have taken
up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat and gone away; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had felt no impulse to do this; on the
contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had a horrible inclination to stay and shatter Rosamond
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger. It seemed as impossible to bear the fatality she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had
drawn down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) without venting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fury as it would be to a panther
to bear the javelin-wound without springing and biting. And yet--how
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) tell a woman that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was ready to curse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was fuming
under a repressive law which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was
dangerously poised, and Rosamond's voice now brought the decisive
vibration. In flute-like tones of sarcasm she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can easily go after Mrs. Casaubon and explain your preference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go after her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) burst out, with a sharp edge in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">``Do you
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would turn to look at me, or value any word I ever uttered to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) again at more than a dirty feather?--Explain! How can a man
explain at the expense of a woman?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) what you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond with more tremor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would like me better for sacrificing you? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is
not a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable--to
believe that I must be true to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) because I was a dastard to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) began to move about with the restlessness of a wild animal that sees
prey but cannot reach it. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) burst out again--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had no hope before--not much--of anything better to come. But I had
one certainty--that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believed in me. Whatever people had said or
done about me, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) believed in me.--That's gone! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll never again
think me anything but a paltry pretence--too nice to take heaven
except upon flattering conditions, and yet selling myself for any
devil's change by the sly. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll think of me as an incarnate insult
to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), from the first moment we--''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Will stopped as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had found himself grasping something that must
not be thrown and shattered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) found another vent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) rage by
snatching up Rosamond's words again, as if they were reptiles to be
throttled and flung off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Explain! Tell a man to explain how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped into hell! Explain my
preference! I never had a _preference_ for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), any more than I have a
preference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I
would rather touch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand if it were dead, than I would touch any
other woman's living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond, while these poisoned weapons were being hurled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), was
almost losing the sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) identity, and seemed to be waking into
some new terrible existence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had no sense of chill resolute
repulsion, of reticent self-justification such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had known under
Lydgate's most stormy displeasure: all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sensibility was turned into
a bewildering novelty of pain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt a new terrified recoil under a
lash never experienced before. What another nature felt in opposition
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own was being burnt and bitten into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) consciousness. When
Will had ceased to speak she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had become an image of sickened misery:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) lips were pale, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) eyes had a tearless dismay in them. If it
had been Tertius who stood opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), that look of misery would
have been a pang to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would have sunk by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) side to comfort
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), with that strong-armed comfort which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had often held very
cheap.

<p/>Let it be forgiven to Will that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no such movement of pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
had felt no bond beforehand to this woman who had spoiled the ideal
treasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) held himself blameless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
was cruel, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no relenting in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) yet.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had done speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) still moved about, half in absence of
mind, and Rosamond sat perfectly still. At length Will, seeming to
bethink himself, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hat, yet stood some moments irresolute.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in a way that made a phrase of common politeness
difficult to utter; and yet, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had come to the point of going
away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) without further speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) shrank from it as a brutality;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt checked and stultified in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) walked towards the
mantel-piece and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm on it, and waited in silence for--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
hardly knew what. The vindictive fire was still burning in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
could utter no word of retractation; but it was nevertheless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mind that having come back to this hearth where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had enjoyed a
caressing friendship he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had found calamity seated there--he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had had
suddenly revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) a trouble that lay outside the home as well as
within it. And what seemed a foreboding was pressing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as with
slow pincers:--that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) life might come to be enslaved by this helpless
woman who had thrown herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in the dreary sadness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
heart. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in gloomy rebellion against the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) quick
apprehensiveness foreshadowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) eyes fell on
Rosamond's blighted face it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was the more pitiable
of the two; for pain must enter into its glorified life of memory
before it can turn into compassion.

<p/>And so they remained for many minutes, opposite each other, far apart,
in silence; Will's face still possessed by a mute rage, and Rosamond's
by a mute misery. The poor thing had no force to fling out any passion
in return; the terrible collapse of the illusion towards which all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
hope had been strained was a stroke which had too thoroughly shaken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) little world was in ruins, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt herself tottering in
the midst as a lonely bewildered consciousness.

<p/>Will wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would speak and bring some mitigating shadow
across his (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own cruel speech, which seemed to stand staring at them both
in mockery of any attempt at revived fellowship. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said nothing,
and at last with a desperate effort over himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``Shall I
come in and see Lydgate this evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>Rosamond answered, just audibly.

<p/>And then Will went out of the house, Martha never knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had
been in.

<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was gone, Rosamond tried to get up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) seat, but fell
back fainting. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) came to herself again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt too ill to
make the exertion of rising to ring the bell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) remained helpless
until the girl, surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) long absence, thought for the first
time of looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in all the down-stairs rooms. Rosamond said
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had felt suddenly sick and faint, and wanted to be helped
up-stairs. When there she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) threw herself on the bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) clothes on,
and lay in apparent torpor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had done once before on a memorable
day of grief.

<p/>Lydgate came home earlier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had expected, about half-past five,
and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) there. The perception that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was ill threw every other
thought into the background. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pulse, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) eyes rested
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with more persistence than they had done for a long while, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt some content that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) perceived the difference
in a moment, and seating himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arm gently under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>),
and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My poor Rosamond! has something agitated
you?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) fell into hysterical sobbings and cries, and
for the next hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did nothing but soothe and tend her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) imagined
that Dorothea had been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and that all this effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
nervous system, which evidently involved some new turning towards
himself, was due to the excitement of the new impressions which that
visit had raised.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXIX.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I saw in my dream, that just as they had ended their
talk, they drew nigh to a very miry slough, that was in the
midst of the plain; and they, being heedless, did both fall
suddenly into the bog. The name of the slough was
Despond.'' (<font color='red'><b>BUNYAN/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>--BUNYAN.


<p/>When Rosamond was quiet, and Lydgate had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), hoping that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
might soon sleep under the effect of an anodyne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went into the
drawing-room to fetch a book which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had left there, meaning to spend
the evening in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) work-room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw on the table Dorothea's letter
addressed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not ventured to ask Rosamond if Mrs. Casaubon
had called, but the reading of this letter assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) of the fact, for
Dorothea mentioned that it was to be carried by herself.

<p/>When Will Ladislaw came in a little later Lydgate met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) with a
surprise which made it clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not been told of the earlier
visit, and Will could not say, <div class="bookquote">``Did not Mrs. Lydgate tell you that I
came this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor Rosamond is ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Lydgate added immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not seriously, I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No--only a slight nervous shock--the effect of some agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
has been overwrought lately. The truth is, Ladislaw, I am an unlucky
devil. We have gone through several rounds of purgatory since you
left, and I have lately got on to a worse ledge of it than ever. I
suppose you are only just come down--you look rather battered--you
have not been long enough in the town to hear anything?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I travelled all night and got to the White Hart at eight o'clock this
morning. I have been shutting myself up and resting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will,
feeling himself a sneak, but seeing no alternative to this evasion.

<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) heard Lydgate's account of the troubles which Rosamond had
already depicted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had not mentioned the fact of
Will's name being connected with the public story--this detail not
immediately affecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) now heard it for the first time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought it better to tell you that your name is mixed up with the
disclosures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, who could understand better than most men
how Ladislaw might be stung by the revelation. <div class="bookquote">``You will be sure to
hear it as soon as you turn out into the town. I suppose it is true
that Raffles spoke to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, sardonically. <div class="bookquote">``I shall be fortunate if gossip does
not make me the most disreputable person in the whole affair. I should
think the latest version must be, that I plotted with Raffles to murder
Bulstrode, and ran away from Middlemarch for the purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was thinking <div class="bookquote">``Here is a new ring in the sound of my name to
recommend it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Raffles</b></font>) hearing; however--what does it signify now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said nothing of Bulstrode's offer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Will was very open
and careless about his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) personal affairs, but it was among the more
exquisite touches in nature's modelling of him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had a delicate
generosity which warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) into reticence here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) shrank from saying
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had rejected Bulstrode's money, in the moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) was
learning that it was Lydgate's misfortune to have accepted it.

<p/>Lydgate too was reticent in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) confidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) made no
allusion to Rosamond's feeling under their trouble, and of Dorothea he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
only said, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Casaubon has been the one person to come forward and
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had no belief in any of the suspicions against me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Observing a change in Will's face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) avoided any further mention of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), feeling himself too ignorant of their relation to each other not
to fear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) words might have some hidden painful bearing on it.
And it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that Dorothea was the real cause of the present
visit to Middlemarch.

<p/>The two men were pitying each other, but it was only Will who guessed
the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) companion's trouble. When Lydgate spoke with
desperate resignation of going to settle in London, and said with a
faint smile, <div class="bookquote">``We shall have you again, old fellow.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>Will felt
inexpressibly mournful, and said nothing. Rosamond had that morning
entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to urge this step on Lydgate; and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) as if
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were beholding in a magic panorama a future where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) himself was
sliding into that pleasureless yielding to the small solicitations of
circumstance, which is a commoner history of perdition than any single
momentous bargain.

<p/>We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our
future selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into
insipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was inwardly
groaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
this evening as if the cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) outburst to Rosamond had made an
obligation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) dreaded the obligation: he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) dreaded Lydgate's
unsuspecting good-will: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own distaste for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) spoiled
life, which would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) in motiveless levity.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXX.

<p/>``Stern lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
The Godhead's most benignant grace;
Nor know we anything so fair
As is the smile upon thy face;
Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,
And fragrance in thy footing treads;
Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;
And the most ancient Heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong.
--WORDSWORTH: Ode to Duty.


<p/>When Dorothea had seen Mr. Farebrother in the morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had promised
to go and dine at the parsonage on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) return from Freshitt. There was
a frequent interchange of visits between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and the Farebrother
family, which enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was not at all lonely at the
Manor, and to resist for the present the severe prescription of a lady
companion. When she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) reached home and remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) engagement, she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
was glad of it; and finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had still an hour before she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could
dress for dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) walked straight to the schoolhouse and entered
into a conversation with the master and mistress about the new bell,
giving eager attention to their small details and repetitions, and
getting up a dramatic sense that her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) life was very busy. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) paused on
her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) way back to talk to old Master Bunney who was putting in some
garden-seeds, and discoursed wisely with that rural sage about the
crops that would make the most return on a perch of ground, and the
result of sixty years' experience as to soils--namely, that if your
soil was pretty mellow it would do, but if there came wet, wet, wet to
make it all of a mummy, why then--

<p/>Finding that the social spirit had beguiled her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) into being rather late,
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) dressed hastily and went over to the parsonage rather earlier than
was necessary. That house was never dull, Mr. Farebrother, like
another White of Selborne, having continually something new to tell of
his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) inarticulate guests and proteges, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was teaching the boys not
to torment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had just set up a pair of beautiful goats to be pets
of the village in general, and to walk at large as sacred animals. The
evening went by cheerfully till after tea, Dorothea talking more than
usual and dilating with Mr. Farebrother on the possible histories of
creatures that converse compendiously with their antennae, and for
aught we know may hold reformed parliaments; when suddenly some
inarticulate little sounds were heard which called everybody's
attention.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henrietta Noble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Farebrother, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) small sister
moving about the furniture-legs distressfully, <div class="bookquote">``what is the matter?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lost my tortoise-shell lozenge-box. I fear the kitten has
rolled it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the tiny old lady, involuntarily continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
beaver-like notes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a great treasure, aunt?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>)
glasses and looking at the carpet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw gave it me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Noble. <div class="bookquote">``A German box--very
pretty, but if it falls it always spins away as far as it can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, if it is Ladislaw's present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother, in a deep tone
of comprehension, getting up and hunting. The box was found at last
under a chiffonier, and Miss Noble grasped it with delight, saying, <div class="bookquote">``it
was under a fender the last time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is an affair of the heart with my aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Farebrother,
smiling at Dorothea, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) reseated himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Henrietta Noble forms an attachment to any one, Mrs. Casaubon,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) mother, emphatically,--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is like a dog--she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) would take
their shoes for a pillow and sleep the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw's shoes, I would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta Noble</b></font>)</div>said Henrietta Noble.

<p/>Dorothea made an attempt at smiling in return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was surprised and
annoyed to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart was palpitating violently, and that it
was quite useless to try after a recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) former animation.
Alarmed at herself--fearing some further betrayal of a change so marked
in its occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose and said in a low voice with undisguised
anxiety, <div class="bookquote">``I must go; I have overtired myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Farebrother, quick in perception, rose and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is true; you
must have half-exhausted yourself in talking about Lydgate. That sort
of work tells upon one after the excitement is over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Farebrother/Farebrother</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) arm back to the Manor, but Dorothea did not attempt to
speak, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) said good-night.

<p/>The limit of resistance was reached, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had sunk back helpless
within the clutch of inescapable anguish. Dismissing Tantripp with a
few faint words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) door, and turning away from it towards
the vacant room she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands hard on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head, and
moaned out--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I did love him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then came the hour in which the waves of suffering shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) too
thoroughly to leave any power of thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could only cry in loud
whispers, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sobs, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lost belief which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had planted
and kept alive from a very little seed since the days in Rome--after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lost joy of clinging with silent love and faith to one who,
misprized by others, was worthy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought--after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lost woman's
pride of reigning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) memory--after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sweet dim perspective of
hope, that along some pathway they should meet with unchanged
recognition and take up the backward years as a yesterday.

<p/>In that hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) repeated what the merciful eyes of solitude have
looked on for ages in the spiritual struggles of man--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) besought
hardness and coldness and aching weariness to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) relief from the
mysterious incorporeal might of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anguish: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lay on the bare floor
and let the night grow cold around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) grand woman's frame
was shaken by sobs as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been a despairing child.

<p/>There were two images--two living forms that tore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart in two, as
if it had been the heart of a mother who seems to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child divided
by the sword, and presses one bleeding half to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast while her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
gaze goes forth in agony towards the half which is carried away by the
lying woman that has never known the mother's pang.

<p/>Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the
vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had
trusted--who had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like the spirit of morning visiting the
dim vault where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with
a full consciousness which had never awakened before, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stretched out
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms towards him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and cried with bitter cries that their nearness
was a parting vision: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) discovered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passion to herself in the
unshrinking utterance of despair.

<p/>And there, aloof, yet persistently with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), moving wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moved,
was the Will Ladislaw who was a changed belief exhausted of hope, a
detected illusion--no, a living man towards whom there could not yet
struggle any wail of regretful pity, from the midst of scorn and
indignation and jealous offended pride. The fire of Dorothea's anger
was not easily spent, and it flamed out in fitful returns of spurning
reproach. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come obtruding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life into hers, hers that
might have been whole enough without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheap
regard and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lip-born words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) who had nothing paltry to give in
exchange? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was deluding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--wished, in the very moment
of farewell, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the whole price of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent it half before. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not
stayed among the crowd of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) asked nothing--but only prayed that
they might be less contemptible?

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lost energy at last even for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) loud-whispered cries and
moans: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
sobbed herself to sleep.

<p/>In the chill hours of the morning twilight, when all was dim around
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) awoke--not with any amazed wondering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was or what had
happened, but with the clearest consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was looking into
the eyes of sorrow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose, and wrapped warm things around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and
seated herself in a great chair where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had often watched before.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was vigorous enough to have borne that hard night without feeling
ill in body, beyond some aching and fatigue; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had waked to a new
condition: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) soul had been liberated from its terrible
conflict; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was no longer wrestling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) grief, but could sit
down with it as a lasting companion and make it a sharer in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
thoughts. For now the thoughts came thickly. It was not in Dorothea's
nature, for longer than the duration of a paroxysm, to sit in the
narrow cell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) calamity, in the besotted misery of a consciousness
that only sees another's lot as an accident of its own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) began now to live through that yesterday morning deliberately
again, forcing herself to dwell on every detail and its possible
meaning. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) alone in that scene? Was it her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) event only? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
forced herself to think of it as bound up with another woman's life--a
woman towards whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had set out with a longing to carry some
clearness and comfort into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beclouded youth. In her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first outleap
of jealous indignation and disgust, when quitting the hateful room, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
had flung away all the mercy with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had undertaken that visit.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had enveloped both Will and Rosamond in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) burning scorn, and it
seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as if Rosamond were burned out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sight forever. But
that base prompting which makes a women more cruel to a rival than to a
faithless lover, could have no strength of recurrence in Dorothea when
the dominant spirit of justice within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had once overcome the tumult
and had once shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) the truer measure of things. All the active
thought with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had before been representing to herself the
trials of Lydgate's lot, and this young marriage union which, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own, seemed to have its hidden as well as evident troubles--all this
vivid sympathetic experience returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) now as a power: it
asserted itself as acquired knowledge asserts itself and will not let
us see as we saw in the day of our ignorance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
irremediable grief, that it should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) more helpful, instead of
driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) back from effort.

<p/>And what sort of crisis might not this be in three lives whose contact
with hers laid an obligation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as if they had been suppliants
bearing the sacred branch? The objects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rescue were not to be
sought out by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fancy: they were chosen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) yearned towards
the perfect Right, that it might make a throne within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and rule her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
errant will. <div class="bookquote">``What should I do--how should I act now, this very day,
if I could clutch my own pain, and compel it to silence, and think of
those three?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It had taken long for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to come to that question, and there was light
piercing into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) curtains, and looked out
towards the bit of road that lay in view, with fields beyond outside
the entrance-gates. On the road there was a man with a bundle on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
back and a woman carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby; in the field she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see figures
moving--perhaps the shepherd with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) dog. Far off in the bending sky
was the pearly light; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt the largeness of the world and the
manifold wakings of men to labor and endurance. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a part of that
involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes in selfish
complaining.

<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would resolve to do that day did not yet seem quite clear, but
something that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could achieve stirred her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as with an approaching
murmur which would soon gather distinctness. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off the clothes
which seemed to have some of the weariness of a hard watching in them,
and began to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) toilet. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rang for Tantripp, who
came in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dressing-gown.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, madam, you've never been in bed this blessed night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>burst out
Tantripp, looking first at the bed and then at Dorothea's face, which
in spite of bathing had the pale cheeks and pink eyelids of a mater
dolorosa. <div class="bookquote">``You'll kill yourself, you _will_. Anybody might think now
you had a right to give yourself a little comfort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be alarmed, Tantripp,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, smiling. <div class="bookquote">``I have slept; I
am not ill. I shall be glad of a cup of coffee as soon as possible.
And I want you to bring me my new dress; and most likely I shall want
my new bonnet to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They've lain there a month and more ready for you, madam, and most
thankful I shall be to see you with a couple o' pounds' worth less of
crape,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>said Tantripp, stooping to light the fire. <div class="bookquote">``There's a reason
in mourning, as I've always said; and three folds at the bottom of your
skirt and a plain quilling in your bonnet--and if ever anybody looked
like an angel, it's you in a net quilling--is what's consistent for a
second year. At least, that's _my_ thinking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div>ended Tantripp, looking
anxiously at the fire; <div class="bookquote">``and if anybody was to marry me flattering
himself I should wear those hijeous weepers two years for him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)'d be
deceived by his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) own vanity, that's all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Tantripp</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The fire will do, my good Tan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, speaking as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) used to
do in the old Lausanne days, only with a very low voice; <div class="bookquote">``get me the
coffee.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) folded herself in the large chair, and leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head against it
in fatigued quiescence, while Tantripp went away wondering at this
strange contrariness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) young mistress--that just the morning when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had more of a widow's face than ever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should have asked for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
lighter mourning which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had waived before. Tantripp would never
have found the clew to this mystery. Dorothea wished to acknowledge
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had not the less an active life before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
buried a private joy; and the tradition that fresh garments belonged to
all initiation, haunting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) grasp after even that
slight outward help towards calm resolve. For the resolve was not easy.

<p/>Nevertheless at eleven o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was walking towards Middlemarch,
having made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would make as quietly and unnoticeably
as possible her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) second attempt to see and save Rosamond.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXI.

<p/>``Du Erde warst auch diese Nacht bestandig,
Und athmest neu erquickt zu meinen Fussen,
Beginnest schon mit Lust mich zu umgeben,
Zum regst und ruhrst ein kraftiges Reschliessen
Zum hochsten Dasein immerfort zu streben.
--Faust: 2r Theil.


<p/>When Dorothea was again at Lydgate's door speaking to Martha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was in
the room close by with the door ajar, preparing to go out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) heard
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice, and immediately came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you think that Mrs. Lydgate can receive me this morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said,
having reflected that it would be better to leave out all allusion to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) previous visit.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lydgate/Mr. Lydgate</b></font>)</div>said Lydgate, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought about
Dorothea's looks, which were as much changed as Rosamond's, <div class="bookquote">``if you
will be kind enough to come in and let me tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) that you are here.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has not been very well since you were here yesterday, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) is
better this morning, and I think it is very likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) will be
cheered by seeing you again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>It was plain that Lydgate, as Dorothea had expected, knew nothing about
the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) yesterday's visit; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) appeared to imagine
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had carried it out according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) intention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
prepared a little note asking Rosamond to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) would have
given to the servant if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had not been in the way, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was in
much anxiety as to the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) announcement.

<p/>After leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) into the drawing-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) paused to take a letter
from his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) pocket and put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wrote this last
night, and was going to carry it to Lowick in my ride. When one is
grateful for something too good for common thanks, writing is less
unsatisfactory than speech--one does not at least _hear_ how inadequate
the words are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's face brightened. <div class="bookquote">``It is I who have most to thank for, since
you have let me take that place. You _have_ consented?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said,
suddenly doubting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, the check is going to Bulstrode to-day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said no more, but went up-stairs to Rosamond, who had but lately
finished dressing herself, and sat languidly wondering what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should
do next, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) habitual industry in small things, even in the days of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
sadness, prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to begin some kind of occupation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
dragged through slowly or paused in from lack of interest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) looked
ill, but had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) usual quietude of manner, and Lydgate had
feared to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) by any questions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) of Dorothea's
letter containing the check, and afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``Ladislaw is
come, Rosy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) sat with me last night; I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) will be here again
to-day. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosy</b></font>) looked rather battered and depressed.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And
Rosamond had made no reply.

<p/>Now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) came up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) very gently, <div class="bookquote">``Rosy, dear, Mrs.
Casaubon is come to see you again; you would like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), would you
not?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) colored and gave rather a startled movement did not
surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) after the agitation produced by the interview yesterday--a
beneficent agitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thought, since it seemed to have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) turn
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) again.

<p/>Rosamond dared not say no. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) dared not with a tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) voice
touch the facts of yesterday. Why had Mrs. Casaubon come again? The
answer was a blank which Rosamond could only fill up with dread, for
Will Ladislaw's lacerating words had made every thought of Dorothea a
fresh smart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Nevertheless, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) new humiliating uncertainty
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dared do nothing but comply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not say yes, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) rose and
let Lydgate put a light shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) shoulders, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I am
going out immediately.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then something crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind which prompted
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">``Pray tell Martha not to bring any one else into the
drawing-room.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>And Lydgate assented, thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fully understood
this wish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) down to the drawing-room door, and then turned
away, observing to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was rather a blundering husband to
be dependent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife's trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) on the influence of another
woman.

<p/>Rosamond, wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) soft shawl around her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) walked towards
Dorothea, was inwardly wrapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) soul in cold reserve. Had Mrs.
Casaubon come to say anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) about Will? If so, it was a
liberty that Rosamond resented; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) prepared herself to meet every
word with polite impassibility. Will had bruised her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) pride too sorely
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to feel any compunction towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) and Dorothea: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
injury seemed much the greater. Dorothea was not only the <div class="bookquote">``preferred''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>woman, but had also a formidable advantage in being Lydgate's
benefactor; and to poor Rosamond's pained confused vision it seemed
that this Mrs. Casaubon--this woman who predominated in all things
concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)--must have come now with the sense of having the
advantage, and with animosity prompting her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) to use it. Indeed, not
Rosamond only, but any one else, knowing the outer facts of the case,
and not the simple inspiration on which Dorothea acted, might well have
wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came.

<p/>Looking like the lovely ghost of herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) graceful slimness wrapped
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) soft white shawl, the rounded infantine mouth and cheek
inevitably suggesting mildness and innocence, Rosamond paused at three
yards' distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) visitor and bowed. But Dorothea, who had
taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) gloves, from an impulse which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could never resist when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted a sense of freedom, came forward, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face full of
a sad yet sweet openness, put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand. Rosamond could not avoid
meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) glance, could not avoid putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) small hand into
Dorothea's, which clasped it with gentle motherliness; and immediately
a doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own prepossessions began to stir within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). Rosamond's
eye was quick for faces; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) saw that Mrs. Casaubon's face looked pale
and changed since yesterday, yet gentle, and like the firm softness of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) hand. But Dorothea had counted a little too much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
strength: the clearness and intensity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mental action this morning
were the continuance of a nervous exaltation which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) frame as
dangerously responsive as a bit of finest Venetian crystal; and in
looking at Rosamond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) suddenly found her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) heart swelling, and was
unable to speak--all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) effort was required to keep back tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
succeeded in that, and the emotion only passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face like the
spirit of a sob; but it added to Rosamond's impression that Mrs.
Casaubon's state of mind must be something quite different from what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had imagined.

<p/>So they sat down without a word of preface on the two chairs that
happened to be nearest, and happened also to be close together; though
Rosamond's notion when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) first bowed was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should stay a long
way off from Mrs. Casaubon. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) ceased thinking how anything would
turn out--merely wondering what would come. And Dorothea began to
speak quite simply, gathering firmness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I had an errand yesterday which I did not finish; that is why I am
here again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell
you that I came to talk to you about the injustice that has been shown
towards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you--will it not?--to know a great
deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) may not like to speak about himself just
because it is in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own vindication and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own honor. You will
like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off
believing in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) high character? You will let me speak of this without
thinking that I take a liberty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>The cordial, pleading tones which seemed to flow with generous
heedlessness above all the facts which had filled Rosamond's mind as
grounds of obstruction and hatred between her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and this woman, came as
soothingly as a warm stream over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) shrinking fears. Of course Mrs.
Casaubon had the facts in her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) mind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was not going to speak of
anything connected with them. That relief was too great for Rosamond
to feel much else at the moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) answered prettily, in the new
ease of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) soul--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you have been very good. I shall like to hear anything you
will say to me about Tertius.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The day before yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, ``when I had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to
come to Lowick to give me his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opinion on the affairs of the Hospital,
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told me everything about his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conduct and feelings in this sad event
which has made ignorant people cast suspicions on him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). The reason he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
told me was because I was very bold and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
had never acted dishonorably, and I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to tell me the history.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) confessed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had never told it before, not even to you,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a great dislike to say, ``I was not wrong,<div class="bookquote">'' as if that
were proof, when there are guilty people who will say so. The truth
is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) knew nothing of this man Raffles, or that there were any bad
secrets about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) thought that Mr. Bulstrode offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) the
money because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) repented, out of kindness, of having refused it
before. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) anxiety about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) patient was to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) rightly,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was a little uncomfortable that the case did not end as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
expected; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) thought then and still thinks that there may have been
no wrong in it on any one's part. And I have told Mr. Farebrother, and
Mr. Brooke, and Sir James Chettam: they all believe in your husband.
That will cheer you, will it not? That will give you courage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea's face had become animated, and as it beamed on Rosamond very
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt something like bashful timidity before a
superior, in the presence of this self-forgetful ardor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said, with
blushing embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you: you are very kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been so wrong not to pour out everything about
this to you. But you will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It was because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feels so
much more about your happiness than anything else--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) feels his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life
bound into one with yours, and it hurts him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more than anything, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) misfortunes must hurt you. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could speak to me because I am an
indifferent person. And then I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) if I might come to see you;
because I felt so much for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trouble and yours. That is why I came
yesterday, and why I am come to-day. Trouble is so hard to bear, is it
not?-- How can we live and think that any one has trouble--piercing
trouble--and we could help them, and never try?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea, completely swayed by the feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was uttering,
forgot everything but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was speaking from out the heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own trial to Rosamond's. The emotion had wrought itself more and more
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) utterance, till the tones might have gone to one's very
marrow, like a low cry from some suffering creature in the darkness.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had unconsciously laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand again on the little hand that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had pressed before.

<p/>Rosamond, with an overmastering pang, as if a wound within her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been
probed, burst into hysterical crying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had done the day before
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband. Poor Dorothea was feeling a great wave
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own sorrow returning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought being drawn to the
possible share that Will Ladislaw might have in Rosamond's mental
tumult. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was beginning to fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should not be able to
suppress herself enough to the end of this meeting, and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hand
was still resting on Rosamond's lap, though the hand underneath it was
withdrawn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was struggling against her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own rising sobs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tried
to master herself with the thought that this might be a turning-point
in three lives--not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own; no, there the irrevocable had
happened, but--in those three lives which were touching hers with the
solemn neighborhood of danger and distress. The fragile creature who
was crying close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)--there might still be time to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from
the misery of false incompatible bonds; and this moment was unlike any
other: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) and Rosamond could never be together again with the same
thrilling consciousness of yesterday within them both. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt the
relation between them to be peculiar enough to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) a peculiar
influence, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had no conception that the way in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own
feelings were involved was fully known to Mrs. Lydgate.

<p/>It was a newer crisis in Rosamond's experience than even Dorothea could
imagine: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was under the first great shock that had shattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
dream-world in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been easily confident of herself and
critical of others; and this strange unexpected manifestation of
feeling in a woman whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had approached with a shrinking aversion
and dread, as one who must necessarily have a jealous hatred towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul totter all the more with a sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been
walking in an unknown world which had just broken in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).

<p/>When Rosamond's convulsed throat was subsiding into calm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
withdrew the handkerchief with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
eyes met Dorothea's as helplessly as if they had been blue flowers.
What was the use of thinking about behavior after this crying? And
Dorothea looked almost as childish, with the neglected trace of a
silent tear. Pride was broken down between these two.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We were talking about your husband,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea said, with some
timidity. <div class="bookquote">``I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) looks were sadly changed with suffering the
other day. I had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for many weeks before. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had
been feeling very lonely in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) trial; but I think he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have borne
it all better if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been able to be quite open with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tertius is so angry and impatient if I say anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had been complaining of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ought
not to wonder that I object to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on painful subjects.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was himself he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) blamed for not speaking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``What he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
said of you was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not be happy in doing anything which
made you unhappy--that his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) marriage was of course a bond which must
affect his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) choice about everything; and for that reason he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) refused my
proposal that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should keep his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) position at the Hospital, because that
would bind him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to stay in Middlemarch, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would not undertake to do
anything which would be painful to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could say that to me,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knows that I had much trial in my marriage, from my
husband's illness, which hindered his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) plans and saddened him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
knows that I have felt how hard it is to walk always in fear of hurting
another who is tied to us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea waited a little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had discerned a faint pleasure stealing
over Rosamond's face. But there was no answer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went on, with a
gathering tremor, <div class="bookquote">``Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is
something even awful in the nearness it brings. Even if we loved some
one else better than--than those we were married to, it would be no
use'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--poor Dorothea, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) palpitating anxiety, could only seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
language brokenly--<div class="bookquote">``I mean, marriage drinks up all our power of giving
or getting any blessedness in that sort of love. I know it may be very
dear--but it murders our marriage--and then the marriage stays with us
like a murder--and everything else is gone. And then our husband--if
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved and trusted us, and we have not helped him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), but made a curse
in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) life--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) voice had sunk very low: there was a dread upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) of presuming
too far, and of speaking as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) herself were perfection addressing
error. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was too much preoccupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own anxiety, to be aware
that Rosamond was trembling too; and filled with the need to express
pitying fellowship rather than rebuke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hands on Rosamond's,
and said with more agitated rapidity,--<div class="bookquote">``I know, I know that the feeling
may be very dear--it has taken hold of us unawares--it is so hard, it
may seem like death to part with it--and we are weak--I am weak--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>The waves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own sorrow, from out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was struggling to
save another, rushed over Dorothea with conquering force. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) stopped
in speechless agitation, not crying, but feeling as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) were being
inwardly grappled. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face had become of a deathlier paleness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
lips trembled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands helplessly on the hands that
lay under them.

<p/>Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own--hurried
along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful,
undefined aspect--could find no words, but involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
lips to Dorothea's forehead which was very near her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and then for a
minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a
shipwreck.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thinking what is not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, in an eager
half-whisper, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was still feeling Dorothea's arms round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--urged by a mysterious necessity to free herself from something
that oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) as if it were blood guiltiness.

<p/>They moved apart, looking at each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you came in yesterday--it was not as you thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond
in the same tone.

<p/>There was a movement of surprised attention in Dorothea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) expected
a vindication of Rosamond herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was telling me how he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loved another woman, that I might know he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
could never love me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, getting more and more hurried as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">``And now I think he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hates me because--because you
mistook him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) yesterday. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) says it is through me that you will think
ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--think that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a false person. But it shall not be
through me. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has never had any love for me--I know he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has not--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
has always thought slightly of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said yesterday that no other
woman existed for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) beside you. The blame of what happened is
entirely mine. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could never explain to you--because of me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said you could never think well of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again. But now I have told
you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cannot reproach me any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>Rosamond had delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) soul under impulses which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had not known
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had begun her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) confession under the subduing influence of
Dorothea's emotion; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went on she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had gathered the sense that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was repelling Will's reproaches, which were still like a
knife-wound within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>The revulsion of feeling in Dorothea was too strong to be called joy.
It was a tumult in which the terrible strain of the night and morning
made a resistant pain:--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could only perceive that this would be joy
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) power of feeling it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) immediate
consciousness was one of immense sympathy without check; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cared for
Rosamond without struggle now, and responded earnestly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) last
words--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cannot reproach you any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div><p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) usual tendency to over-estimate the good in others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) felt a
great outgoing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) heart towards Rosamond, for the generous effort
which had redeemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) from suffering, not counting that the effort was
a reflex of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own energy. After they had been silent a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not sorry that I came this morning?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you have been very good to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond. <div class="bookquote">``I did not think

Everything is so sad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But better days will come. Your husband will be rightly valued. And
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) depends on you for comfort. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) loves you best. The worst loss
would be to lose that--and you have not lost it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tried to thrust away the too overpowering thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) own
relief, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) should fail to win some sign that Rosamond's affection
was yearning back towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tertius did not find fault with me, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond,
understanding now that Lydgate might have said anything to Mrs.
Casaubon, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) certainly was different from other women.
Perhaps there was a faint taste of jealousy in the question. A smile
began to play over Dorothea's face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed! How could you imagine it?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But here the door opened, and
Lydgate entered.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am come back in my quality of doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``After I went away,
I was haunted by two pale faces: Mrs. Casaubon looked as much in need
of care as you, Rosy. And I thought that I had not done my duty in
leaving you together; so when I had been to Coleman's I came home
again. I noticed that you were walking, Mrs. Casaubon, and the sky has
changed--I think we may have rain. May I send some one to order your
carriage to come for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no! I am strong: I need the walk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rising with
animation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Lydgate and I have chatted a great deal,
and it is time for me to go. I have always been accused of being
immoderate and saying too much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand to Rosamond, and they said an earnest, quiet
good-by without kiss or other show of effusion: there had been between
them too much serious emotion for them to use the signs of it
superficially.

<p/>As Lydgate took her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to the door she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) said nothing of Rosamond, but told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) of Mr. Farebrother and the other friends who had listened with
belief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) story.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) came back to Rosamond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had already thrown herself on the
sofa, in resigned fatigue.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Rosy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Farebrother</b></font>) said, standing over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hair, <div class="bookquote">``what

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) must be better than any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Vincy/Rosamond Vincy</b></font>)</div>said Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is

large white hand to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>), and felt thankful for this little mark of
interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Poor Rosamond's vagrant fancy had come back terribly
scourged--meek enough to nestle under the old despised shelter. And
the shelter was still there: Lydgate had accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) narrowed lot with
sad resignation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had chosen this fragile creature, and had taken
the burthen of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) life upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must walk as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could,
carrying that burthen pitifully.



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My grief lies onward and my joy behind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--SHAKESPEARE: Sonnets.


<p/>Exiles notoriously feed much on hopes, and are unlikely to stay in
banishment unless they are obliged. When Will Ladislaw exiled himself
from Middlemarch he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had placed no stronger obstacle to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) return than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) own resolve, which was by no means an iron barrier, but simply a
state of mind liable to melt into a minuet with other states of mind,
and to find itself bowing, smiling, and giving place with polite
facility. As the months went on, it had seemed more and more difficult
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to say why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) should not run down to Middlemarch--merely for the
sake of hearing something about Dorothea; and if on such a flying visit
he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) should chance by some strange coincidence to meet with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), there
was no reason for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to be ashamed of having taken an innocent journey
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had beforehand supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) should not take. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was
hopelessly divided from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) might surely venture into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
neighborhood; and as to the suspicious friends who kept a dragon watch
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--their opinions seemed less and less important with time and
change of air.

<p/>And there had come a reason quite irrespective of Dorothea, which
seemed to make a journey to Middlemarch a sort of philanthropic duty.
Will had given a disinterested attention to an intended settlement on a
new plan in the Far West, and the need for funds in order to carry out
a good design had set him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) on debating with himself whether it would not
be a laudable use to make of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) claim on Bulstrode, to urge the
application of that money which had been offered to himself as a means
of carrying out a scheme likely to be largely beneficial. The question
seemed a very dubious one to Will, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) repugnance to again entering
into any relation with the banker might have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) dismiss it
quickly, if there had not arisen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) imagination the probability
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) judgment might be more safely determined by a visit to
Middlemarch.

<p/>That was the object which Will stated to himself as a reason for coming
down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had meant to confide in Lydgate, and discuss the money
question with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had meant to amuse himself for the few
evenings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) stay by having a great deal of music and badinage with
fair Rosamond, without neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) friends at Lowick Parsonage:--if
the Parsonage was close to the Manor, that was no fault of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
neglected the Farebrothers before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) departure, from a proud
resistance to the possible accusation of indirectly seeking interviews
with Dorothea; but hunger tames us, and Will had become very hungry for
the vision of a certain form and the sound of a certain voice.
Nothing, had done instead--not the opera, or the converse of zealous
politicians, or the flattering reception -LRB-in dim corners-RRB- of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) new
hand in leading articles.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had come down, foreseeing with confidence how almost everything
would be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) familiar little world; fearing, indeed, that there
would be no surprises in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) visit. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had found that humdrum
world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and
lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become
the most fatal epoch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) life. The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) felt so harassed
with the nightmare of consequences--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) dreaded so much the immediate
issues before him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)--that seeing while he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) breakfasted the arrival of the
Riverston coach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) went out hurriedly and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) place on it, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing
or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those
tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine,
from the shallow absoluteness of men's judgments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had found
Lydgate, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had the sincerest respect, under circumstances
which claimed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the
reason why, in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will
to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate,
was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To
a creature of Will's susceptible temperament--without any neutral
region of indifference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) nature, ready to turn everything that
befell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) into the collisions of a passionate drama--the revelation
that Rosamond had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) happiness in any way dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was a
difficulty which his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) outburst of rage towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had immeasurably
increased for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) own cruelty, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dreaded to
show the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) relenting: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) again; the
friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) unhappiness was a
power which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste
of enjoyment in the life before him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) than if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) limbs had been lopped
off and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was making his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) fresh start on crutches. In the night he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had
debated whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but
for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift
reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) retreat. But there were strong cords pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) back
from that abrupt departure: the blight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) happiness in thinking of
Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite
of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance
which was also despair.

<p/>Thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) did nothing more decided than taking the Riverston coach. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
came back again by it while it was still daylight, having made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) must go to Lydgate's that evening. The Rubicon, we know,
was a very insignificant stream to look at; its significance lay
entirely in certain invisible conditions. Will felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) were
forced to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) small boundary ditch, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw beyond it was
not empire, but discontented subjection.

<p/>But it is given to us sometimes even in our every-day life to witness
the saving influence of a noble nature, the divine efficacy of rescue
that may lie in a self-subduing act of fellowship. If Dorothea, after
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) night's anguish, had not taken that walk to Rosamond--why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
perhaps would have been a woman who gained a higher character for
discretion, but it would certainly not have been as well for those
three who were on one hearth in Lydgate's house at half-past seven that
evening.

<p/>Rosamond had been prepared for Will's visit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) with
a languid coldness which Lydgate accounted for by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) nervous
exhaustion, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) could not suppose that it had any relation to
Will. And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) sat in silence bending over a bit of work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
innocently apologized for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) in an indirect way by begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) to lean
backward and rest. Will was miserable in the necessity for playing the
part of a friend who was making his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) first appearance and greeting to
Rosamond, while his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thoughts were busy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) feeling since that
scene of yesterday, which seemed still inexorably to enclose them both,
like the painful vision of a double madness. It happened that nothing
called Lydgate out of the room; but when Rosamond poured out the tea,
and Will came near to fetch it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) placed a tiny bit of folded paper
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saucer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) saw it and secured it quickly, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) went back
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) inn he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had no eagerness to unfold the paper. What Rosamond had
written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) would probably deepen the painful impressions of the
evening. Still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) opened and read it by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) bed-candle. There were
only these few words in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) neatly flowing hand:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told Mrs. Casaubon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is not under any mistake about you. I
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) came to see me and was very kind. You will have
nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any difference
to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect of these words was not quite all gladness. As Will dwelt on
them with excited imagination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) cheeks and ears burning at
the thought of what had occurred between Dorothea and Rosamond--at the
uncertainty how far Dorothea might still feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) dignity wounded in
having an explanation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) conduct offered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). There might still
remain in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind a changed association with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) which made an
irremediable difference--a lasting flaw. With active fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wrought
himself into a state of doubt little more easy than that of the man who
has escaped from wreck by night and stands on unknown ground in the
darkness. Until that wretched yesterday--except the moment of
vexation long ago in the very same room and in the very same
presence--all their vision, all their thought of each other, had been
as in a world apart, where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies,
where no evil lurked, and no other soul entered. But now--would
Dorothea meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in that world again?



<p/>CHAPTER LXXXIII.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And now good-morrow to our waking souls

 (<font color='red'><b>DR. DONNE</b></font>)</div>--DR. DONNE.


<p/>On the second morning after Dorothea's visit to Rosamond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had had
two nights of sound sleep, and had not only lost all traces of fatigue,
but felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had a great deal of superfluous strength--that is
to say, more strength than she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) could manage to concentrate on any
occupation. The day before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had taken long walks outside the
grounds, and had paid two visits to the Parsonage; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
life told any one the reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) time in that fruitless
manner, and this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) was rather angry with herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)
childish restlessness. To-day was to be spent quite differently. What
was there to be done in the village? Oh dear! nothing. Everybody was
well and had flannel; nobody's pig had died; and it was Saturday
morning, when there was a general scrubbing of doors and door-stones,
and when it was useless to go into the school. But there were various
subjects that Dorothea was trying to get clear upon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) resolved
to throw herself energetically into the gravest of all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sat down
in the library before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) particular little heap of books on political
economy and kindred matters, out of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was trying to get light
as to the best way of spending money so as not to injure one's
neighbors, or--what comes to the same thing--so as to do them the most
good. Here was a weighty subject which, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could but lay hold of
it, would certainly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind steady. Unhappily her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind slipped
off it for a whole hour; and at the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) found herself reading
sentences twice over with an intense consciousness of many things, but
not of any one thing contained in the text. This was hopeless. Should
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) order the carriage and drive to Tipton? No; for some reason or
other she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) preferred staying at Lowick. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) vagrant mind must be
reduced to order: there was an art in self-discipline; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) walked
round and round the brown library considering by what sort of manoeuvre
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could arrest her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wandering thoughts. Perhaps a mere task was the
best means--something to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) must go doggedly. Was there not the
geography of Asia Minor, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) slackness had often been rebuked
by Mr. Casaubon? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went to the cabinet of maps and unrolled one:
this morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might make herself finally sure that Paphlagonia was
not on the Levantine coast, and fix her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) total darkness about the
Chalybes firmly on the shores of the Euxine. A map was a fine thing to
study when you were disposed to think of something else, being made up
of names that would turn into a chime if you went back upon them.
Dorothea set earnestly to work, bending close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) map, and uttering
the names in an audible, subdued tone, which often got into a chime.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked amusingly girlish after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) deep experience--nodding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head and marking the names off on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) fingers, with a little
pursing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lip, and now and then breaking off to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands on
each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face and say, <div class="bookquote">``Oh dear! oh dear!''

 (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no reason why this should end any more than a merry-go-round;
but it was at last interrupted by the opening of the door and the
announcement of Miss Noble.

<p/>The little old lady, whose bonnet hardly reached Dorothea's shoulder,
was warmly welcomed, but while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand was being pressed she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) made many
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) beaver-like noises, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had something difficult to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do sit down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, rolling a chair forward. <div class="bookquote">``Am I wanted
for anything? I shall be so glad if I can do anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Miss Noble, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) small
basket, and holding some article inside it nervously; <div class="bookquote">``I have left a
friend in the churchyard.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lapsed into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) inarticulate sounds,
and unconsciously drew forth the article which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was fingering. It
was the tortoise-shell lozenge-box, and Dorothea felt the color
mounting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>continued the timid little woman. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) fears he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has
offended you, and has begged me to ask if you will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) for a few
minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea did not answer on the instant: it was crossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) mind that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in this library, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's
prohibition seemed to dwell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked towards the window. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
go out and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) in the grounds? The sky was heavy, and the trees
had begun to shiver as at a coming storm. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) shrank from
going out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>), Mrs. Casaubon,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Noble, pathetically; <div class="bookquote">``else I
must go back and say No, and that will hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea. <div class="bookquote">``Pray tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>What else was there to be done? There was nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) longed for
at that moment except to see Will: the possibility of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had
thrust itself insistently between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and every other object; and yet
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had a throbbing excitement like an alarm upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)--a sense that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was doing something daringly defiant for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sake.

<p/>When the little lady had trotted away on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mission, Dorothea stood in
the middle of the library with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands falling clasped before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
making no attempt to compose herself in an attitude of dignified
unconsciousness. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was least conscious of just then was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own
body: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was thinking of what was likely to be in Will's mind, and of
the hard feelings that others had had about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). How could any duty
bind her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to hardness? Resistance to unjust dispraise had mingled with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) feeling for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from the very first, and now in the rebound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
heart after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) anguish the resistance was stronger than ever. <div class="bookquote">``If I
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) too much it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) has been used so ill:'' (<font color='red'><b>some audience</b></font>)</div>--there was a
voice within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saying this to some imagined audience in the library,
when the door was opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) saw Will before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not move, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with more doubt and timidity
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) face than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had ever seen before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was in a state of
uncertainty which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) afraid lest some look or word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should
condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to a new distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>); and Dorothea was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
_own_ emotion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked as if there were a spell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), keeping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) motionless and hindering her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from unclasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands, while some
intense, grave yearning was imprisoned within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes. Seeing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) did not put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand as usual, Will paused a yard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and
said with embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``I am so grateful to you for seeing me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, having no other words at command.
It did not occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to sit down, and Will did not give a cheerful
interpretation to this queenly way of receiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) went on to
say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear you think me foolish and perhaps wrong for coming back so soon.
I have been punished for my impatience. You know--every one knows
now--a painful story about my parentage. I knew of it before I went
away, and I always meant to tell you of it if--if we ever met again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a slight movement in Dorothea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) unclasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands,
but immediately folded them over each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But the affair is matter of gossip now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Will continued. <div class="bookquote">``I wished
you to know that something connected with it--something which happened
before I went away, helped to bring me down here again. At least I
thought it excused my coming. It was the idea of getting Bulstrode to
apply some money to a public purpose--some money which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had thought
of giving me. Perhaps it is rather to Bulstrode's credit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
privately offered me compensation for an old injury: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) offered to give
me a good income to make amends; but I suppose you know the
disagreeable story?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Will looked doubtfully at Dorothea, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) manner was gathering some
of the defiant courage with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) always thought of this fact in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>)
destiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``You know that it must be altogether painful to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--yes--I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, hastily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not choose to accept an income from such a source. I was sure
that you would not think well of me if I did so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will. Why
should he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) mind saying anything of that sort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) knew that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) had avowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I felt that'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) broke off,
nevertheless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You acted as I should have expected you to act,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
face brightening and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head becoming a little more erect on its
beautiful stem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not believe that you would let any circumstance of my birth
create a prejudice in you against me, though it was sure to do so in
others,''  (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) head backward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) old way, and
looking with a grave appeal into her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If it were a new hardship it would be a new reason for me to cling to
you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, fervidly. <div class="bookquote">``Nothing could have changed me but--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) heart was swelling, and it was difficult to go on; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) made a great
effort over herself to say in a low tremulous voice, <div class="bookquote">``but thinking that
you were different--not so good as I had believed you to be.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are sure to believe me better than I am in everything but one,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Will/Ladislaw/Will Ladislaw</b></font>)</div>said Will, giving way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) own feeling in the evidence of hers. <div class="bookquote">``I
mean, in my truth to you. When I thought you doubted of that, I didn't
care about anything that was left. I thought it was all over with me,
and there was nothing to try for--only things to endure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't doubt you any longer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, putting out her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand; a
vague fear for him (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) impelling her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) unutterable affection.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand and raised it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) lips with something like a sob.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hat and gloves in the other hand, and might have
done for the portrait of a Royalist. Still it was difficult to loose
the hand, and Dorothea, withdrawing it in a confusion that distressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), looked and moved away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how dark the clouds have become, and how the trees are tossed,''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said, walking towards the window, yet speaking and moving with only
a dim sense of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was doing.

<p/>Will followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) at a little distance, and leaned against the tall
back of a leather chair, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) ventured now to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) hat and
gloves, and free himself from the intolerable durance of formality to
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) had been for the first time condemned in Dorothea's presence.
It must be confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) felt very happy at that moment leaning on
the chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) was not much afraid of anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might feel now.

<p/>They stood silent, not looking at each other, but looking at the
evergreens which were being tossed, and were showing the pale underside
of their leaves against the blackening sky. Will never enjoyed the
prospect of a storm so much: it delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) from the necessity of
going away. Leaves and little branches were hurled about, and the
thunder was getting nearer. The light was more and more sombre, but
there came a flash of lightning which made them start and look at each
other, and then smile. Dorothea began to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had been
thinking of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a wrong thing for you to say, that you would have had nothing
to try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people's good
would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I
seemed to see that more clearly than ever, when I was the most
wretched. I can hardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if
that feeling had not come to me to make strength.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have never felt the sort of misery I felt,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will; <div class="bookquote">``the misery
of knowing that you must despise me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I have felt worse--it was worse to think ill--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>Dorothea had begun
impetuously, but broke off.

<p/>Will colored. He (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) had the sense that whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said was uttered in
the vision of a fatality that kept them apart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) was silent a moment,
and then said passionately--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We may at least have the comfort of speaking to each other without
disguise. Since I must go away--since we must always be divided--you
may think of me as one on the brink of the grave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Royalist</b></font>) was speaking there came a vivid flash of lightning which lit
each of them up for the other--and the light seemed to be the terror of
a hopeless love. Dorothea darted instantaneously from the window; Will
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand with a spasmodic movement; and so they
stood, with their hands clasped, like two children, looking out on the
storm, while the thunder gave a tremendous crack and roll above them,
and the rain began to pour down. Then they turned their faces towards
each other, with the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) last words in them, and they did not
loose each other's hands.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no hope for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will. <div class="bookquote">``Even if you loved me as well as
I love you--even if I were everything to you--I shall most likely
always be very poor: on a sober calculation, one can count on nothing
but a creeping lot. It is impossible for us ever to belong to each
other. It is perhaps base of me to have asked for a word from you. I
meant to go away into silence, but I have not been able to do what I
meant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) clear tender tones. <div class="bookquote">``I would
rather share all the trouble of our parting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) lips trembled, and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). It was never known which lips were
the first to move towards the other lips; but they kissed tremblingly,
and then they moved apart.

<p/>The rain was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit
were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind; it was
one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a
certain awe.

<p/>Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), a long low ottoman in the
middle of the room, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands folded over each other on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
lap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still an instant
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), then seated himself beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hand on
hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat in that way
without looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall
in stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them
could begin to utter.

<p/>But when the rain was quiet, Dorothea turned to look at Will. With
passionate exclamation, as if some torture screw were threatening him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) started up and said, <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible!''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) went and leaned on the back of the chair again, and seemed to be
battling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) own anger, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) looked towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sadly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as fatal as a murder or any other horror that divides people,''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) burst out again; <div class="bookquote">``it is more intolerable--to have our life maimed by
petty accidents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--don't say that--your life need not be maimed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea,
gently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it must,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, angrily. <div class="bookquote">``It is cruel of you to speak in
that way--as if there were any comfort. You may see beyond the misery
of it, but I don't. It is unkind--it is throwing back my love for you
as if it were a trifle, to speak in that way in the face of the fact.
We can never be married.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some time--we might,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, in a trembling voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Will, bitterly. <div class="bookquote">``What is the use of counting on any
success of mine? It is a mere toss up whether I shall ever do more
than keep myself decently, unless I choose to sell myself as a mere pen
and a mouthpiece. I can see that clearly enough. I could not offer
myself to any woman, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no luxuries to renounce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was silence. Dorothea's heart was full of something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
wanted to say, and yet the words were too difficult. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was wholly
possessed by them: at that moment debate was mute within her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). And it
was very hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wanted to say. Will was
looking out of the window angrily. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) would have looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and
not gone away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) thought everything would have been
easier. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) turned, still resting against the chair, and
stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hand automatically towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) hat, said with a sort of
exasperation, <div class="bookquote">``Good-by.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I cannot bear it--my heart will break,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, starting
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) seat, the flood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) young passion bearing down all the
obstructions which had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) silent--the great tears rising and
falling in an instant: <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind about poverty--I hate my wealth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>In an instant Will was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) head back and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) away gently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might go on
speaking, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) large tear-filled eyes looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Will</b></font>) very simply, while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said in a sobbing childlike way, <div class="bookquote">``We could live quite well on my
own fortune--it is too much--seven hundred a-year--I want so little--no
new clothes--and I will learn what everything costs.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER LXXXIV.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Though it be songe of old and yonge,
That I sholde be to blame,
Theyrs be the charge, that spoke so large
In hurtynge of my name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--The Not-Browne Mayde.


<p/>It was just after the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill: that
explains how Mr. Cadwallader came to be walking on the slope of the
lawn near the great conservatory at Freshitt Hall, holding the <div class="bookquote">``Times''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) hands behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) talked with a trout-fisher's
dispassionateness about the prospects of the country to Sir James
Chettam. Mrs. Cadwallader, the Dowager Lady Chettam, and Celia were
sometimes seated on garden-chairs, sometimes walking to meet little
Arthur, who was being drawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) chariot, and, as became the
infantine Bouddha, was sheltered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) sacred umbrella with handsome
silken fringe.

<p/>The ladies also talked politics, though more fitfully. Mrs.
Cadwallader was strong on the intended creation of peers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) had it
for certain from her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) cousin that Truberry had gone over to the other
side entirely at the instigation of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife, who had scented peerages
in the air from the very first introduction of the Reform question, and
would sign her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) soul away to take precedence of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) younger sister, who
had married a baronet. Lady Chettam thought that such conduct was very
reprehensible, and remembered that Mrs. Truberry's mother was a Miss
Walsingham of Melspring. Celia confessed it was nicer to be <div class="bookquote">``Lady''
 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>than <div class="bookquote">``Mrs.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>and that Dodo never minded about precedence if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) could
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) own way. Mrs. Cadwallader held that it was a poor
satisfaction to take precedence when everybody about you knew that you
had not a drop of good blood in your veins; and Celia again, stopping
to look at Arthur, said, <div class="bookquote">``It would be very nice, though, if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were a
Viscount--and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lordship's little tooth coming through! He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might
have been, if James had been an Earl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Arthur</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Dowager</b></font>)</div>said the Dowager, <div class="bookquote">``James's title is worth far more
than any new earldom. I never wished his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father to be anything else
than Sir James.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Dowager</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I only meant about Arthur's little tooth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia,
comfortably. <div class="bookquote">``But see, here is my uncle coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) tripped off to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) uncle, while Sir James and Mr. Cadwallader
came forward to make one group with the ladies. Celia had slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
arm through her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) uncle's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) patted her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) hand with a rather
melancholy <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As they approached, it was evident that
Mr. Brooke was looking dejected, but this was fully accounted for by
the state of politics; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was shaking hands all round without
more greeting than a <div class="bookquote">``Well, you're all here, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the Rector
said, laughingly--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't take the throwing out of the Bill so much to heart, Brooke;
you've got all the riff-raff of the country on your side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Bill, eh? ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, with a mild distractedness of
manner. <div class="bookquote">``Thrown out, you know, eh? The Lords are going too far,
though. They'll have to pull up. Sad news, you know. I mean, here at
home--sad news. But you must not blame me, Chettam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``Not another gamekeeper shot, I
hope? It's what I should expect, when a fellow like Trapping Bass is
let off so easily.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gamekeeper? No. Let us go in; I can tell you all in the house, you
know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, nodding at the Cadwalladers, to show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
included them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) confidence. <div class="bookquote">``As to poachers like Trapping Bass,
you know, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) continued, as they were entering, <div class="bookquote">``when you are
a magistrate, you'll not find it so easy to commit. Severity is all
very well, but it's a great deal easier when you've got somebody to do
it for you. You have a soft place in your heart yourself, you
know--you're not a Draco, a Jeffreys, that sort of thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke was evidently in a state of nervous perturbation. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
had something painful to tell, it was usually his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) way to introduce it
among a number of disjointed particulars, as if it were a medicine that
would get a milder flavor by mixing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) chat with Sir
James about the poachers until they were all seated, and Mrs.
Cadwallader, impatient of this drivelling, said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm dying to know the sad news. The gamekeeper is not shot: that is
settled. What is it, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it's a very trying thing, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad
you and the Rector are here; it's a family matter--but you will help
us all to bear it, Cadwallader. I've got to break it to you, my dear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>Here Mr. Brooke looked at Celia--<div class="bookquote">``You've no notion what it is, you
know. And, Chettam, it will annoy you uncommonly--but, you see, you
have not been able to hinder it, any more than I have. There's
something singular in things: they come round, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be about Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, who had been used to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had seated
herself on a low stool against her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband's knee.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``For God's sake let us hear what it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Chettam, I couldn't help Casaubon's will: it was a
sort of will to make things worse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, hastily. <div class="bookquote">``But _what_ is worse?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea is going to be married again, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke,
nodding towards Celia, who immediately looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband with a
frightened glance, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) knee. Sir James was almost
white with anger, but he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Merciful heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``Not to _young_ Ladislaw?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke nodded, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; to Ladislaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>and then fell into a
prudential silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, Humphrey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) arm towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>)
husband. <div class="bookquote">``Another time you will admit that I have some foresight; or
rather you will contradict me and be just as blind as ever. _You_
supposed that the young gentleman was gone out of the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be, and yet come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, quietly

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did you learn this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, not liking to hear any one
else speak, though finding it difficult to speak himself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, meekly. <div class="bookquote">``I went to Lowick. Dorothea
sent for me, you know. It had come about quite suddenly--neither of
them had any idea two days ago--not any idea, you know. There's
something singular in things. But Dorothea is quite determined--it is
no use opposing. I put it strongly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>). I did my duty, Chettam.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) can act as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) likes, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It would have been better if I had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) out and shot him (<font color='blue'><b>Chettam</b></font>) a year
ago,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, not from bloody-mindedness, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) needed
something strong to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really, James, that would have been very disagreeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be reasonable, Chettam. Look at the affair more quietly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Cadwallader, sorry to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) good-natured friend so overmastered by
anger.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not so very easy for a man of any dignity--with any sense of
right--when the affair happens to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own family,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir
James, still in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) white indignation. <div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly scandalous.
If Ladislaw had had a spark of honor he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would have gone out of the
country at once, and never shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) face in it again. However, I am
not surprised. The day after Casaubon's funeral I said what ought to
be done. But I was not listened to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You wanted what was impossible, you know, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke.
<div class="bookquote">``You wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) shipped off. I told you Ladislaw was not to be done as
we liked with: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) ideas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was a remarkable fellow--I always
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) was a remarkable fellow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, unable to repress a retort, <div class="bookquote">``it is rather a pity
you formed that high opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>). We are indebted to that for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>)
being lodged in this neighborhood. We are indebted to that for seeing
a woman like Dorothea degrading herself by marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>Sir James
made little stoppages between his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) clauses, the words not coming easily.
<div class="bookquote">``A man so marked out by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband's will, that delicacy ought to have
forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) from seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again--who takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) proper
rank--into poverty--has the meanness to accept such a sacrifice--has
always had an objectionable position--a bad origin--and, I _believe_,
is a man of little principle and light character. That is my opinion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>Sir James ended emphatically, turning aside and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) leg.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I pointed everything out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, apologetically--``I
mean the poverty, and abandoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) position. I said, ``My dear, you
don't know what it is to live on seven hundred a-year, and have no
carriage, and that kind of thing, and go amongst people who don't know
who you are.<div class="bookquote">'' I put it strongly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>). But I advise you to talk to
Dorothea herself. The fact is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) has a dislike to Casaubon's
property. You will hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) says, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--excuse me--I shall not,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, with more coolness. <div class="bookquote">``I
cannot bear to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) again; it is too painful. It hurts me too much
that a woman like Dorothea should have done what is wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Be just, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the easy, large-lipped Rector, who objected to
all this unnecessary discomfort. <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Casaubon may be acting
imprudently: she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) is giving up a fortune for the sake of a man, and we
men have so poor an opinion of each other that we can hardly call a
woman wise who does that. But I think you should not condemn it as a
wrong action, in the strict sense of the word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>answered Sir James. <div class="bookquote">``I think that Dorothea commits a
wrong action in marrying Ladislaw.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it
is unpleasant to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, quietly. Like many men who take
life easily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rector</b></font>) had the knack of saying a home truth occasionally to
those who felt themselves virtuously out of temper. Sir James took out
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) handkerchief and began to bite the corner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very dreadful of Dodo, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, wishing to justify
her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) _never would_ marry again--not anybody at
all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) say the same thing myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Lady Chettam,
majestically, as if this were royal evidence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, there is usually a silent exception in such cases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``The only wonder to me is, that any of you are surprised.
You did nothing to hinder it. If you would have had Lord Triton down
here to woo her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Triton</b></font>) philanthropy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Triton</b></font>) might have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) off
before the year was over. There was no safety in anything else. Mr.
Casaubon had prepared all this as beautifully as possible. He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) made
himself disagreeable--or it pleased God to make him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) so--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
dared her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It's the way to make any trumpery
tempting, to ticket it at a high price in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean by wrong, Cadwallader,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James,
still feeling a little stung, and turning round in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) chair towards
the Rector. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s not a man we can take into the family. At least, I
must speak for myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) continued, carefully keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eyes off
Mr. Brooke. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose others will find his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) society too pleasant to
care about the propriety of the thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, Chettam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, good-humoredly, nursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
leg, ``I can't turn my back on Dorothea. I must be a father to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) up
to a certain point. I said, ``My dear, I won't refuse to give you
away.<div class="bookquote">'' I had spoken strongly before. But I can cut off the entail,
you know. It will cost money and be troublesome; but I can do it, you
know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke nodded at Sir James, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was both showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
own force of resolution and propitiating what was just in the Baronet's
vexation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had hit on a more ingenious mode of parrying than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was
aware of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had touched a motive of which Sir James was ashamed. The
mass of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) feeling about Dorothea's marriage to Ladislaw was due
partly to excusable prejudice, or even justifiable opinion, partly to a
jealous repugnance hardly less in Ladislaw's case than in Casaubon's.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was convinced that the marriage was a fatal one for Dorothea. But
amid that mass ran a vein of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was too good and honorable a man
to like the avowal even to himself: it was undeniable that the union of
the two estates--Tipton and Freshitt--lying charmingly within a
ring-fence, was a prospect that flattered him (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tipton</b></font>) son and heir.
Hence when Mr. Brooke noddingly appealed to that motive, Sir James felt
a sudden embarrassment; there was a stoppage in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) throat; he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) even
blushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had found more words than usual in the first jet of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
anger, but Mr. Brooke's propitiation was more clogging to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) tongue
than Mr. Cadwallader's caustic hint.

<p/>But Celia was glad to have room for speech after her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) uncle's suggestion
of the marriage ceremony, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) said, though with as little eagerness
of manner as if the question had turned on an invitation to dinner, <div class="bookquote">``Do
you mean that Dodo is going to be married directly, uncle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In three weeks, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, helplessly. <div class="bookquote">``I can do
nothing to hinder it, Cadwallader,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) added, turning for a little
countenance toward the Rector, who said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">''--I--should not make any fuss about it. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) likes to be poor, that
is her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) affair. Nobody would have said anything if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had married the
young fellow because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was rich. Plenty of beneficed clergy are
poorer than they will be. Here is Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>continued the provoking
husband; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Cadwallader</b></font>) friends by me: I had hardly a thousand
a-year--I was a lout--nobody could see anything in me--my shoes were
not the right cut--all the men wondered how a woman could like me.
Upon my word, I must take Ladislaw's part until I hear more harm of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>the husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Humphrey, that is all sophistry, and you know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife.
<div class="bookquote">``Everything is all one--that is the beginning and end with you. As if
you had not been a Cadwallader! Does any one suppose that I would have
taken such a monster as you by any other name?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And a clergyman too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Chettam</b></font>)</div>observed Lady Chettam with approbation. <div class="bookquote">``Elinor
cannot be said to have descended below her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rank. It is difficult to
say what Mr. Ladislaw is, eh, James?''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir James gave a small grunt, which was less respectful than his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) usual
mode of answering his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mother. Celia looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) like a thoughtful
kitten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be admitted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) blood is a frightful mixture!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Cadwallader. <div class="bookquote">``The Casaubon cuttle-fish fluid to begin with, and then a
rebellious Polish fiddler or dancing-master, was it?--and then an old
clo--''

 (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Elinor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Rector</b></font>)</div>said the Rector, rising. <div class="bookquote">``It is time for us to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``After all, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) is a pretty sprig,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cadwallader/Cadwallader</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Cadwallader, rising too,
and wishing to make amends. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>fiddler</b></font>) is like the fine old Crichley
portraits before the idiots came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll go with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, starting up with alacrity. <div class="bookquote">``You
must all come and dine with me to-morrow, you know--eh, Celia, my dear?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will, James--won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) husband's hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, of course, if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, pulling down his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
waistcoat, but unable yet to adjust his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) face good-humoredly. <div class="bookquote">``That is
to say, if it is not to meet anybody else.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brooke/Tipton/Mr. Brooke of Tipton</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Brooke, understanding the condition. <div class="bookquote">``Dorothea
would not come, you know, unless you had been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div><p/>When Sir James and Celia were alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you mind about my
having the carriage to go to Lowick, James?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, now, directly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) answered, with some surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it is very important,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember, Celia, I cannot see her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) gave up marrying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What is the use of saying that?--however, I'm going to the stables.
I'll tell Briggs to bring the carriage round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia thought it was of great use, if not to say that, at least to take
a journey to Lowick in order to influence Dorothea's mind. All through
their girlhood she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could act on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister by a word
judiciously placed--by opening a little window for the daylight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
own understanding to enter among the strange colored lamps by which
Dodo habitually saw. And Celia the matron naturally felt more able to
advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) childless sister. How could any one understand Dodo so well
as Celia did or love her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) so tenderly?

<p/>Dorothea, busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) boudoir, felt a glow of pleasure at the sight of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) sister so soon after the revelation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) intended marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had prefigured to herself, even with exaggeration, the disgust of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
friends, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had even feared that Celia might be kept aloof from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O Kitty, I am delighted to see you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) hands
on Celia's shoulders, and beaming on her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I almost thought you would
not come to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not brought Arthur, because I was in a hurry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, and
they sat down on two small chairs opposite each other, with their knees
touching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Dodo, it is very bad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) placid guttural,
looking as prettily free from humors as possible. <div class="bookquote">``You have
disappointed us all so. And I can't think that it ever _will_ be--you
never can go and live in that way. And then there are all your plans!
You never can have thought of that. James would have taken any trouble
for you, and you might have gone on all your life doing what you liked.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``I never could do anything that
I liked. I have never carried out any plan yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you always wanted things that wouldn't do. But other plans
would have come. And how can you marry Mr. Ladislaw, that we none of
us ever thought you _could_ marry? It shocks James so dreadfully. And
then it is all so different from what you have always been. You would
have Mr. Casaubon because he (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) had such a great soul, and was so and
dismal and learned; and now, to think of marrying Mr. Ladislaw, who has
got no estate or anything. I suppose it is because you must be making
yourself uncomfortable in some way or other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it is very serious, Dodo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, becoming more impressive.
<div class="bookquote">``How will you live? and you will go away among queer people. And I
shall never see you--and you won't mind about little Arthur--and I
thought you always would--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/>Celia's rare tears had got into her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) eyes, and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) mouth
were agitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with tender gravity, <div class="bookquote">``if you don't ever
see me, it will not be my fault.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, with the same touching distortion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
small features. <div class="bookquote">``How can I come to you or have you with me when James
can't bear it?--that is because he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thinks it is not right--he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) thinks
you are so wrong, Dodo. But you always were wrong: only I can't help
loving you. And nobody can think where you will live: where can you
go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you always live in a street? And you will be so poor. I
could give you half my things, only how can I, when I never see you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bless you, Kitty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said Dorothea, with gentle warmth. <div class="bookquote">``Take comfort:
perhaps James will forgive me some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it would be much better if you would not be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia,
drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) eyes, and returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) argument; <div class="bookquote">``then there would be
nothing uncomfortable. And you would not do what nobody thought you
could do. James always said you ought to be a queen; but this is not
at all being like a queen. You know what mistakes you have always been
making, Dodo, and this is another. Nobody thinks Mr. Ladislaw a proper
husband for you. And you _said you_ would never be married again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true that I might be a wiser person, Celia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div>said
Dorothea, <div class="bookquote">``and that I might have done something better, if I had been
better. But this is what I am going to do. I have promised to marry
Mr. Ladislaw; and I am going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>The tone in which Dorothea said this was a note that Celia had long
learned to recognize. She (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) was silent a few moments, and then said, as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) had dismissed all contest, <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) very fond of you, Dodo?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope so. I am very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is nice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, comfortably. <div class="bookquote">``Only I rather you had such a
sort of husband as James is, with a place very near, that I could drive
to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Dorothea/Brooke/Dorothea Brooke</b></font>)</div><p/>Dorothea smiled, and Celia looked rather meditative. Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
said, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot think how it all came about.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Celia thought it would be
pleasant to hear the story.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say not,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said-Dorothea, pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) sister's chin. <div class="bookquote">``If you

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you tell me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Celia</b></font>)</div>said Celia, settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) arms cozily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.''

unanimously concluded to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in guilty before the
judge. And first among themselves, Mr. Blindman, the
foreman, said, I see clearly that this man is a heretic.
Then said Mr. No-good, Away with such a fellow from the
earth! Ay, said Mr. Malice, for I hate the very look of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
Then said Mr. Love-lust, I could never endure him (<font color='blue'><b>Love-lust</b></font>). Nor I,
said Mr. Live-loose; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would be always condemning my
way. Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), hang him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), said Mr. Heady. A sorry scrub, said
Mr. High-mind. My heart riseth against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), said Mr. Enmity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is a rogue, said Mr. Liar. Hanging is too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>),
said Mr. Cruelty. Let us despatch him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) out of the way said
Mr. Hate-light. Then said Mr. Implacable, Might I have all
the world given me, I could not be reconciled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>);
therefore let us forthwith bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in guilty of death.''

<p/>When immortal Bunyan makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunyan</b></font>) picture of the persecuting passions
bringing in their verdict of guilty, who pities Faithful? That is a
rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know
ourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd--to be sure that what we
are denounced for is solely the good in us. The pitiable lot is that
of the man who could not call himself a martyr even though he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) were to
persuade himself that the men who stoned him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) were but ugly passions
incarnate--who knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) is stoned, not for professing the Right,
but for not being the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professed to be.

<p/>This was the consciousness that Bulstrode was withering under while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) preparations for departing from Middlemarch, and going to end
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) stricken life in that sad refuge, the indifference of new faces.
The duteous merciful constancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife had delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) from one
dread, but it could not hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) presence from being still a tribunal
before which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) shrank from confession and desired advocacy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
equivocations with himself about the death of Raffles had sustained the
conception of an Omniscience whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) prayed to, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had a terror
upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) which would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) expose them to judgment by a full
confession to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife: the acts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had washed and diluted with
inward argument and motive, and for which it seemed comparatively easy
to win invisible pardon--what name would she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) call them by? That she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
should ever silently call his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) acts Murder was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) could not bear.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt shrouded by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) doubt: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) got strength to face her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from the
sense that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not yet feel warranted in pronouncing that worst
condemnation on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). Some time, perhaps--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was dying--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) would
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all: in the deep shadow of that time, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) hand
in the gathering darkness, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might listen without recoiling from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>)
touch. Perhaps: but concealment had been the habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) life, and
the impulse to confession had no power against the dread of a deeper
humiliation.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was full of timid care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife, not only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) deprecated
any harshness of judgment from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) felt a deep distress
at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters away to
board at a school on the coast, that this crisis might be hidden from
them as far as possible. Set free by their absence from the
intolerable necessity of accounting for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grief or of beholding their
frightened wonder, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could live unconstrainedly with the sorrow that
was every day streaking her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair with whiteness and making her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyelids
languid.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me anything that you would like to have me do, Harriet,''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Bulstrode had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I mean with regard to arrangements of
property. It is my intention not to sell the land I possess in this
neighborhood, but to leave it to you as a safe provision. If you have
any wish on such subjects, do not conceal it from me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A few days afterwards, when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had returned from a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
brother's, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband on a subject which had for
some time been in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mind.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I _should_ like to do something for my brother's family, Nicholas; and
I think we are bound to make some amends to Rosamond and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband.
Walter says Mr. Lydgate must leave the town, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) practice is almost
good for nothing, and they have very little left to settle anywhere
with. I would rather do without something for ourselves, to make some
amends to my poor brother's family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bulstrode did not wish to go nearer to the facts than in the
phrase <div class="bookquote">``make some amends;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) husband must understand
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a particular reason, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) was not aware of, for
wincing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) suggestion. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hesitated before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not possible to carry out your wish in the way you propose, my
dear. Mr. Lydgate has virtually rejected any further service from me.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) has returned the thousand pounds which I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>). Mrs. Casaubon
advanced him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) the sum for that purpose. Here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) letter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The letter seemed to cut Mrs. Bulstrode severely. The mention of Mrs.
Casaubon's loan seemed a reflection of that public feeling which held
it a matter of course that every one would avoid a connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>)
husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) was silent for some time; and the tears fell one after
the other, her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) chin trembling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) wiped them away. Bulstrode,
sitting opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), ached at the sight of that grief-worn face,
which two months before had been bright and blooming. It had aged to
keep sad company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) own withered features. Urged into some
effort at comforting her (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is another means, Harriet, by which I might do a service to your
brother's family, if you like to act in it. And it would, I think, be
beneficial to you: it would be an advantageous way of managing the land
which I mean to be yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Casaubon</b></font>) looked attentive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Garth once thought of undertaking the management of Stone Court in
order to place your nephew Fred there. The stock was to remain as it
is, and they were to pay a certain share of the profits instead of an
ordinary rent. That would be a desirable beginning for the young man,
in conjunction with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employment under Garth. Would it be a
satisfaction to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bulstrode, with some return of energy.
<div class="bookquote">``Poor Walter is so cast down; I would try anything in my power to do
him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) some good before I go away. We have always been brother and
sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must make the proposal to Garth yourself, Harriet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bulstrode/Mr. Bulstrode</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bulstrode, not liking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had to say, but desiring the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) had
in view, for other reasons besides the consolation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bulstrode</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">``You
must state to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that the land is virtually yours, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) need

put into your hands a paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) himself drew up, stating
conditions; and you can propose his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) renewed acceptance of them. I
think it is not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) will accept when you propose the thing
for the sake of your nephew.''

<p/>Mrs. Garth, hearing Caleb enter the passage about tea-time, opened the
parlor-door and said, <div class="bookquote">``There you are, Caleb. Have you had your
dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr. Garth's meals were much subordinated to <div class="bookquote">``business.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, a good dinner--cold mutton and I don't know what. Where is
Mary?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In the garden with Letty, I think.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fred is not come yet?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. Are you going out again without taking tea, Caleb?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Garth, seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) absent-minded husband was putting on again the
hat which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had just taken off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; I'm only going to Mary a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary was in a grassy corner of the garden, where there was a swing
loftily hung between two pear-trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a pink kerchief tied over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) head, making a little poke to shade her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes from the level
sunbeams, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was giving a glorious swing to Letty, who laughed
and screamed wildly.

<p/>Seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) father, Mary left the swing and went to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), pushing
back the pink kerchief and smiling afar off at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with the involuntary
smile of loving pleasure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to look for you, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Garth. <div class="bookquote">``Let us walk about a
bit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Mary knew quite well that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father had something particular to say:
his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) eyebrows made their pathetic angle, and there was a tender gravity
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) voice: these things had been signs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was Letty's
age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>), and they turned by the row of
nut-trees.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be a sad while before you can be married, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but at the end of the stick which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held
in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) other hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a sad while, father--I mean to be merry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, laughingly.
<div class="bookquote">``I have been single and merry for four-and-twenty years and more: I
suppose it will not be quite as long again as that.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then, after a
little pause, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, more gravely, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) face before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father's, <div class="bookquote">``If you are contented with Fred?''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Caleb screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) mouth and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) head aside wisely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, father, you did praise him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) last Wednesday. You said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an
uncommon notion of stock, and a good eye for things.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, rather slyly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I put it all down, and the date, anno Domini, and everything,''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay; you want to coax me into thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a fine match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, father. I don't love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a fine match.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear, because I have always loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I should never like

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your mind is quite settled, then, Mary?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>said Caleb, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
first tone. <div class="bookquote">``There's no other wish come into it since things have been
going on as they have been of late?''  (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Caleb meant a great deal in that

seeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for
everything. We must wait for each other a long while; but Fred knows
that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Caleb/Caleb Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>Instead of speaking immediately, Caleb stood still and screwed his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>)
stick on the grassy walk. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) said, with emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Caleb</b></font>) voice,
<div class="bookquote">``Well, I've got a bit of news. What do you think of Fred going to live
at Stone Court, and managing the land there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can that ever be, father?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>said Mary, wonderingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would manage it for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aunt Bulstrode. The poor woman has been to
me begging and praying. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to do the lad good, and it might be
a fine thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). With saving, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) might gradually buy the stock,

<p/>Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young
lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know
what befell them in their after-years? For the fragment of a life,
however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be
kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers
may find their long-waited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand
retrieval.

<p/>Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a
great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in
Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of
the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic--the
gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which
makes the advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet
memories in common.

<p/>Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope
and enthusiasm and get broken by the way, wanting patience with each
other and the world.

<p/>All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that
these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness.
Fred surprised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) neighbors in various ways. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) became rather
distinguished in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) side of the county as a theoretic and practical
farmer, and produced a work on the <div class="bookquote">``Cultivation of Green Crops and the
Economy of Cattle-Feeding''  (<font color='red'><b>a farmer</b></font>)</div>which won him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) high congratulations at
agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved:
most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred's
authorship was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) wife, since they had never expected Fred
Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.

<p/>But when Mary wrote a little book for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) boys, called <div class="bookquote">``Stories of
Great Men, taken from Plutarch,''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>and had it printed and published by
Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the
credit of this work to Fred, observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had been to the
University, <div class="bookquote">``where the ancients were studied,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and might have been a
clergyman if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had chosen.

<p/>In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived,
and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since
it was always done by somebody else.

<p/>Moreover, Fred remained unswervingly steady. Some years after his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) told Mary that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) happiness was half owing to Farebrother,
who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) a strong pull-up at the right moment. I cannot say that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was never again misled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hopefulness: the yield of crops or the
profits of a cattle sale usually fell below his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) estimate; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) was
always prone to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) could make money by the purchase of a
horse which turned out badly--though this, Mary observed, was of
course the fault of the horse, not of Fred's judgment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>)
love of horsemanship, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) rarely allowed himself a day's hunting;
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) did so, it was remarkable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) submitted to be laughed
at for cowardliness at the fences, seeming to see Mary and the boys
sitting on the five-barred gate, or showing their curly heads between
hedge and ditch.

<p/>There were three boys: Mary was not discontented that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brought forth
men-children only; and when Fred wished to have a girl like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said, laughingly, <div class="bookquote">``that would be too great a trial to your mother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Vincy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) declining years, and in the diminished lustre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>)
housekeeping, was much comforted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Vincy</b></font>) perception that two at least of
Fred's boys were real Vincys, and did not <div class="bookquote">``feature the Garths.''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred boys</b></font>)</div>But
Mary secretly rejoiced that the youngest of the three was very much
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father must have been when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wore a round jacket, and showed
a marvellous nicety of aim in playing at marbles, or in throwing stones
to bring down the mellow pears.

<p/>Ben and Letty Garth, who were uncle and aunt before they were well in
their teens, disputed much as to whether nephews or nieces were more
desirable; Ben contending that it was clear girls were good for less
than boys, else they would not be always in petticoats, which showed
how little they were meant for; whereupon Letty, who argued much from
books, got angry in replying that God made coats of skins for both Adam
and Eve alike--also it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) that in the East the men too
wore petticoats. But this latter argument, obscuring the majesty of
the former, was one too many, for Ben answered contemptuously, <div class="bookquote">``The
more spooneys they!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ben</b></font>)</div>and immediately appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ben</b></font>) mother whether
boys were not better than girls. Mrs. Garth pronounced that both were
alike naughty, but that boys were undoubtedly stronger, could run
faster, and throw with more precision to a greater distance. With this
oracular sentence Ben was well satisfied, not minding the naughtiness;
but Letty took it ill, her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) feeling of superiority being stronger than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Letty</b></font>) muscles.

<p/>Fred never became rich--his (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) hopefulness had not led him (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) to expect that;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) gradually saved enough to become owner of the stock and
furniture at Stone Court, and the work which Mr. Garth put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>)
hands carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Garth</b></font>) in plenty through those <div class="bookquote">``bad times''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which are always
present with farmers. Mary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) matronly days, became as solid in
figure as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother; but, unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), gave the boys little formal
teaching, so that Mrs. Garth was alarmed lest they should never be well
grounded in grammar and geography. Nevertheless, they were found quite
forward enough when they went to school; perhaps, because they had
liked nothing so well as being with their mother. When Fred was riding
home on winter evenings he (<font color='blue'><b>Fred</b></font>) had a pleasant vision beforehand of the
bright hearth in the wainscoted parlor, and was sorry for other men who
could not have Mary for their wife; especially for Mr. Farebrother.
<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was ten times worthier of you than I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fred/Mr. Fred</b></font>)</div>Fred could now say to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), magnanimously. <div class="bookquote">``To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div>Mary answered; <div class="bookquote">``and for that
reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could do better without me. But you--I shudder to think what
you would have been--a curate in debt for horse-hire and cambric
pocket-handkerchiefs!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Garth/Garth</b></font>)</div><p/>On inquiry it might possibly be found that Fred and Mary still inhabit
Stone Court--that the creeping plants still cast the foam of their
blossoms over the fine stone-wall into the field where the walnut-trees
stand in stately row--and that on sunny days the two lovers who were
first engaged with the umbrella-ring may be seen in white-haired
placidity at the open window from which Mary Garth, in the days of old
Peter Featherstone, had often been ordered to look out for Mr. Lydgate.

<p/>Lydgate's hair never became white. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) died when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) was only fifty,
leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) wife and children provided for by a heavy insurance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had gained an excellent practice, alternating, according to
the season, between London and a Continental bathing-place; having
written a treatise on Gout, a disease which has a good deal of wealth
on its side. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) skill was relied on by many paying patients, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>)
always regarded himself as a failure: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) had not done what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) once
meant to do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) acquaintances thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) enviable to have so
charming a wife, and nothing happened to shake their opinion. Rosamond
never committed a second compromising indiscretion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) simply
continued to be mild in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) temper, inflexible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) judgment,
disposed to admonish her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) husband, and able to frustrate him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by
stratagem. As the years went on he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) less and less, whence
Rosamond concluded that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had learned the value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) opinion; on the
other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) had a more thorough conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) talents now that
he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gained a good income, and instead of the threatened cage in Bride
Street provided one all flowers and gilding, fit for the bird of
paradise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) resembled. In brief, Lydgate was what is called a
successful man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) died prematurely of diphtheria, and Rosamond
afterwards married an elderly and wealthy physician, who took kindly to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) four children. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) made a very pretty show with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) daughters,
driving out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) carriage, and often spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) happiness as <div class="bookquote">``a
reward'' (<font color='red'><b>daughters</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) did not say for what, but probably she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) meant that it was a
reward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) patience with Tertius, whose temper never became
faultless, and to the last occasionally let slip a bitter speech which
was more memorable than the signs he (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) repentance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) once
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Lydgate</b></font>) basil plant; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) asked for an explanation, said
that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered
man's brains. Rosamond had a placid but strong answer to such
speeches. Why then had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>)? It was a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not had
Mrs. Ladislaw, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always praising and placing above her (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>). And
thus the conversation ended with the advantage on Rosamond's side. But
it would be unjust not to tell, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) never uttered a word in
depreciation of Dorothea, keeping in religious remembrance the
generosity which had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) aid in the sharpest crisis of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life.

<p/>Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women,
feeling that there was always something better which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) might have
done, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had only been better and known better. Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) never
repented that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had given up position and fortune to marry Will
Ladislaw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) would have held it the greatest shame as well as
sorrow to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had repented. They were bound to each other by a
love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life
would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself.
Will became an ardent public man, working well in those times when
reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has
been much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to
Parliament by a constituency who paid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expenses. Dorothea could
have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband
should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) should
give him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wifely help. Many who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>), thought it a pity that so
substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life
of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother.
But no one stated exactly what else that was in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) power she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ought
rather to have done--not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further
than the negative prescription that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ought not to have married Will
Ladislaw.

<p/>But this opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ladislaw</b></font>) did not cause a lasting alienation; and the way
in which the family was made whole again was characteristic of all
concerned. Mr. Brooke could not resist the pleasure of corresponding
with Will and Dorothea; and one morning when his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pen had been
remarkably fluent on the prospects of Municipal Reform, it ran off into
an invitation to the Grange, which, once written, could not be done
away with at less cost than the sacrifice -LRB-hardly to be conceived-RRB- of
the whole valuable letter. During the months of this correspondence
Mr. Brooke had continually, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) talk with Sir James Chettam, been
presupposing or hinting that the intention of cutting off the entail
was still maintained; and the day on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) pen gave the daring
invitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) went to Freshitt expressly to intimate that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) had a
stronger sense than ever of the reasons for taking that energetic step
as a precaution against any mixture of low blood in the heir of the
Brookes.

<p/>But that morning something exciting had happened at the Hall. A letter
had come to Celia which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) cry silently as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) read it; and when
Sir James, unused to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) in tears, asked anxiously what was the
matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>) burst out in a wail such as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had never heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Celia</b></font>)
before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorothea has a little boy. And you will not let me go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>).
And I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) wants to see me. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) will not know what to do
with the baby--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) will do wrong things with it. And they thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>)
would die. It is very dreadful! Suppose it had been me and little
Arthur, and Dodo had been hindered from coming to see me! I wish you
would be less unkind, James!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens, Celia!''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>said Sir James, much wrought upon, <div class="bookquote">``what do you
wish? I will do anything you like. I will take you to town to-morrow
if you wish it.''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Chettam/Chettam</b></font>)</div>And Celia did wish it.

<p/>It was after this that Mr. Brooke came, and meeting the Baronet in the
grounds, began to chat with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) in ignorance of the news, which Sir
James for some reason did not care to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) immediately. But when
the entail was touched on in the usual way, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear sir, it
is not for me to dictate to you, but for my part I would let that
alone. I would let things remain as they are.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brooke felt so much surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) did not at once find out how
much he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was relieved by the sense that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) was not expected to do
anything in particular.

<p/>Such being the bent of Celia's heart, it was inevitable that Sir James
should consent to a reconciliation with Dorothea and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) husband.
Where women love each other, men learn to smother their mutual dislike.
Sir James never liked Ladislaw, and Will always preferred to have Sir
James's company mixed with another kind: they were on a footing of
reciprocal tolerance which was made quite easy only when Dorothea and
Celia were present.

<p/>It became an understood thing that Mr. and Mrs. Ladislaw should pay at
least two visits during the year to the Grange, and there came
gradually a small row of cousins at Freshitt who enjoyed playing with
the two cousins visiting Tipton as much as if the blood of these
cousins had been less dubiously mixed.

<p/>Mr. Brooke lived to a good old age, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) estate was inherited by
Dorothea's son, who might have represented Middlemarch, but declined,
thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>) opinions had less chance of being stifled if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brooke</b></font>)
remained out of doors.

<p/>Sir James never ceased to regard Dorothea's second marriage as a
mistake; and indeed this remained the tradition concerning it in
Middlemarch, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine
girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) father, and
in little more than a year after his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death gave up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) estate to marry
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cousin--young enough to have been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son, with no property, and
not well-born. Those who had not seen anything of Dorothea usually
observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) could not have been <div class="bookquote">``a nice woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>else she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) would
not have married either the one or the other.

<p/>Certainly those determining acts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) life were not ideally
beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse
struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which
great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the
aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so
strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A
new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventual
life, any more than a new Antigone will spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Theresa</b></font>) heroic piety in
daring all for the sake of a brother's burial: the medium in which
their ardent deeds took shape is forever gone. But we insignificant
people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many
Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that
of the Dorothea whose story we know.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) finely touched spirit had still its fine issues, though they were
not widely visible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) full nature, like that river of which Cyrus
broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on
the earth. But the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) being on those around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothea</b></font>) was
incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly
dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you
and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived
faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
