<p/>NORTHANGER ABBEY


<p/>by

<p/>Jane Austen -LRB-1803-RRB-




<p/>ADVERTISEMENT BY THE AUTHORESS, TO NORTHANGER ABBEY

<p/>THIS little work was finished in the year 1803, and intended for
immediate publication. It was disposed of to a bookseller, it was even
advertised, and why the business proceeded no farther, the author
has never been able to learn. That any bookseller should think it
worth-while to purchase what he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) did not think it worth-while to publish
seems extraordinary. But with this, neither the author nor the public
have any other concern than as some observation is necessary upon those
parts of the work which thirteen years have made comparatively obsolete.
The public are entreated to bear in mind that thirteen years have passed
since it was finished, many more since it was begun, and that during
that period, places, manners, books, and opinions have undergone
considerable changes.



<p/>CHAPTER 1


<p/>No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) infancy would have
supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) born to be an heroine. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) situation in life, the character
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father and mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own person and disposition, were
all equally against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father was a clergyman, without being
neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name
was Richard--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a considerable
independence besides two good livings--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in the least
addicted to locking up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) mother was a woman of useful
plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a
good constitution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had three sons before Catherine was born; and
instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might
expect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still lived on--lived to have six children more--to see them
growing up around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family
of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there are
heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had
little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain, and
Catherine, for many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life, as plain as any. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a thin
awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong
features--so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) person; and not less unpropitious for heroism
seemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was fond of all boy's plays, and greatly preferred
cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic enjoyments of
infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a
rose-bush. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no taste for a garden; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gathered
flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief--at least
so it was conjectured from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) always preferring those which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
forbidden to take. Such were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) propensities--her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) abilities were quite
as extraordinary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never could learn or understand anything
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was often
inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother was three months in
teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only to repeat the <div class="bookquote">``Beggar's Petition'' (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>; and after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
next sister, Sally, could say it better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did. Not that Catherine
was always stupid--by no means; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt the fable of <div class="bookquote">``The Hare and
Many Friends''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as quickly as any girl in England. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
to learn music; and Catherine was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should like it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet; so, at eight
years old she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt a year, and could not bear it; and Mrs.
Morland, who did not insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) daughters being accomplished in
spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to leave off. The day which
dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine's life.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) taste for drawing was not superior; though whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could obtain
the outside of a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother or seize upon any other odd
piece of paper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could in that way, by drawing houses
and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing
and accounts she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was taught by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father; French by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) shirked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lessons in
both whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could. What a strange, unaccountable character!--for
with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had neither
a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever
quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions
of tyranny; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and
cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the
green slope at the back of the house.

<p/>Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) began to curl her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) hair and long for balls; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) complexion improved,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) features were softened by plumpness and colour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) eyes gained more
animation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) figure more consequence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) love of dirt gave way to
an inclination for finery, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) grew clean as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) grew smart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had
now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father and mother remark
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) personal improvement. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine grows quite a good-looking
girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is almost pretty today,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>were words which caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) ears now
and then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an
acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain the
first fifteen years of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life than a beauty from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cradle can ever
receive.

<p/>Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) children
everything they ought to be; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) time was so much occupied in
lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) elder daughters were
inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful
that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), should
prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about
the country at the age of fourteen, to books--or at least books of
information--for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be
gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in training for a heroine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) read all such works as heroines
must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so
serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives.

<p/>From Pope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt to censure those who

<p/><div class="bookquote">``bear about the mockery of woe.''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From Gray, that

<p/>``Many a flower is born to blush unseen,
<div class="bookquote">``And waste its fragrance on the desert air.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>From Thompson, that--

<p/>``It is a delightful task
<div class="bookquote">``To teach the young idea how to shoot.''


 (<font color='red'><b>Thompson that</b></font>)</div><p/>And from Shakespeare she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gained a great store of information--amongst
the rest, that--

<p/>``Trifles light as air,
``Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,
<div class="bookquote">``As proofs of Holy Writ.''


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>That

<p/>``The poor beetle, which we tread upon,
``In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great
<div class="bookquote">``As when a giant dies.''


 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>And that a young woman in love always looks--

<p/>``like Patience on a monument
<div class="bookquote">``Smiling at Grief.''


 (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><p/>So far her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) improvement was sufficient--and in many other points she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came
on exceedingly well; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not write sonnets, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brought
herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) throwing
a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
composition, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could listen to other people's performance with very
little fatigue. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) greatest deficiency was in the pencil--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no
notion of drawing--not enough even to attempt a sketch of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lover's
profile, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be detected in the design. There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell
miserably short of the true heroic height. At present she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own poverty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no lover to portray. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had reached the
age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could call
forth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sensibility, without having inspired one real passion, and
without having excited even any admiration but what was very moderate
and very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange things may be
generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched out. There was
not one lord in the neighbourhood; no--not even a baronet. There was not
one family among their acquaintance who had reared and supported a boy
accidentally found at their door--not one young man whose origin
was unknown. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father had no ward, and the squire of the parish no
children.

<p/>But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty
surrounding families cannot prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>). Something must and will happen
to throw a hero in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) way.

<p/>Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the
village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath
for the benefit of a gouty constitution--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) lady, a good-humoured
woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will
not befall a young lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own village, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must seek them abroad,
invited her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,
and Catherine all happiness.




<p/>CHAPTER 2


<p/>In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's
personal and mental endowments, when about to be launched into all the
difficulties and dangers of a six weeks' residence in Bath, it may be
stated, for the reader's more certain information, lest the following
pages should otherwise fail of giving any idea of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) character is
meant to be, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) heart was affectionate; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) disposition cheerful
and open, without conceit or affectation of any kind--her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) manners just
removed from the awkwardness and shyness of a girl; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) person pleasing,
and, when in good looks, pretty--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) mind about as ignorant and
uninformed as the female mind at seventeen usually is.

<p/>When the hour of departure drew near, the maternal anxiety of Mrs.
Morland will be naturally supposed to be most severe. A thousand
alarming presentiments of evil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) beloved Catherine from this
terrific separation must oppress her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) heart with sadness, and drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
in tears for the last day or two of their being together; and advice of
the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
wise lips in their parting conference in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) closet. Cautions against
the violence of such noblemen and baronets as delight in forcing young
ladies away to some remote farm-house, must, at such a moment, relieve
the fulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) heart. Who would not think so? But Mrs. Morland knew
so little of lords and baronets, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) entertained no notion of their
general mischievousness, and was wholly unsuspicious of danger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
daughter from their machinations. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) cautions were confined to the
following points. <div class="bookquote">``I beg, Catherine, you will always wrap yourself up
very warm about the throat, when you come from the rooms at night; and
I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend; I will
give you this little book on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div><p/>Sally, or rather Sarah -LRB-for what young lady of common gentility will
reach the age of sixteen without altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) name as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) can?-RRB-,
must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) sister. It is remarkable, however, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) neither insisted
on Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) promise of
transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail
of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce. Everything
indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the
Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed
rather consistent with the common feelings of common life, than with the
refined susceptibilities, the tender emotions which the first separation
of a heroine from her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) family ought always to excite. Her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) father, instead
of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) an unlimited order on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) banker, or even putting an
hundred pounds bank-bill into her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) hands, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) only ten guineas, and
promised her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) more when she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) wanted it.

<p/>Under these unpromising auspices, the parting took place, and the
journey began. It was performed with suitable quietness and uneventful
safety. Neither robbers nor tempests befriended them, nor one lucky
overturn to introduce them to the hero. Nothing more alarming occurred
than a fear, on Mrs. Allen's side, of having once left her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) clogs behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) at an inn, and that fortunately proved to be groundless.

<p/>They arrived at Bath. Catherine was all eager delight--her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes were
here, there, everywhere, as they approached its fine and striking
environs, and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted
them to the hotel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was come to be happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt happy already.

<p/>They were soon settled in comfortable lodgings in Pulteney Street.

<p/>It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs. Allen, that the
reader may be able to judge in what manner her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) actions will hereafter
tend to promote the general distress of the work, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) will,
probably, contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate
wretchedness of which a last volume is capable--whether by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
imprudence, vulgarity, or jealousy--whether by intercepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) letters,
ruining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) character, or turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out of doors.

<p/>Mrs. Allen was one of that numerous class of females, whose society can
raise no other emotion than surprise at there being any men in the world
who could like them well enough to marry them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had neither beauty,
genius, accomplishment, nor manner. The air of a gentlewoman, a great
deal of quiet, inactive good temper, and a trifling turn of mind
were all that could account for her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) being the choice of a sensible,
intelligent man like Mr. Allen. In one respect she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was admirably fitted
to introduce a young lady into public, being as fond of going everywhere
and seeing everything herself as any young lady could be. Dress was
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passion. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a most harmless delight in being fine; and our
heroine's entree into life could not take place till after three or four
days had been spent in learning what was mostly worn, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chaperone
was provided with a dress of the newest fashion. Catherine too made
some purchases herself, and when all these matters were arranged, the
important evening came which was to usher her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into the Upper Rooms. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hair was cut and dressed by the best hand, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) clothes put on with care,
and both Mrs. Allen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) maid declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) looked quite as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) should
do. With such encouragement, Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured
through the crowd. As for admiration, it was always very welcome when it
came, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not depend on it.

<p/>Mrs. Allen was so long in dressing that they did not enter the ballroom
till late. The season was full, the room crowded, and the two ladies
squeezed in as well as they could. As for Mr. Allen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) repaired
directly to the card-room, and left them to enjoy a mob by themselves.
With more care for the safety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) new gown than for the comfort of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) protegee, Mrs. Allen made her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) way through the throng of men by
the door, as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow; Catherine,
however, kept close at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) side, and linked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm too firmly within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend's to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling
assembly. But to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) utter amazement she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found that to proceed along the
room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd; it
seemed rather to increase as they went on, whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had imagined that
when once fairly within the door, they should easily find seats and be
able to watch the dances with perfect convenience. But this was far from
being the case, and though by unwearied diligence they gained even the
top of the room, their situation was just the same; they saw nothing
of the dancers but the high feathers of some of the ladies. Still they
moved on--something better was yet in view; and by a continued exertion
of strength and ingenuity they found themselves at last in the passage
behind the highest bench. Here there was something less of crowd than
below; and hence Miss Morland had a comprehensive view of all the
company beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), and of all the dangers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) late passage through
them. It was a splendid sight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) began, for the first time that
evening, to feel herself at a ball: she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) longed to dance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had
not an acquaintance in the room. Mrs. Allen did all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could do
in such a case by saying very placidly, every now and then, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you
could dance, my dear--I wish you could get a partner.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For some time
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) young friend felt obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) for these wishes; but they were
repeated so often, and proved so totally ineffectual, that Catherine
grew tired at last, and would thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) no more.

<p/>They were not long able, however, to enjoy the repose of the eminence
they had so laboriously gained. Everybody was shortly in motion for
tea, and they must squeeze out like the rest. Catherine began to feel
something of disappointment--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was tired of being continually pressed
against by people, the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to
interest, and with all of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was so wholly unacquainted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a
syllable with any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fellow captives; and when at last arrived in
the tea-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to
join, no acquaintance to claim, no gentleman to assist them. They saw
nothing of Mr. Allen; and after looking about them in vain for a more
eligible situation, were obliged to sit down at the end of a table, at
which a large party were already placed, without having anything to do
there, or anybody to speak to, except each other.

<p/>Mrs. Allen congratulated herself, as soon as they were seated, on having
preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) gown from injury. <div class="bookquote">``It would have been very shocking to
have it torn,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``would not it? It is such a delicate muslin.
For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room, I
assure you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How uncomfortable it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>whispered Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``not to have a single
acquaintance here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Allen, with perfect serenity, <div class="bookquote">``it is very
uncomfortable indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What shall we do? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if
they wondered why we came here--we seem forcing ourselves into their
party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, so we do. That is very disagreeable. I wish we had a large
acquaintance here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish we had any--it would be somebody to go to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, my dear; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly.
The Skinners were here last year--I wish they were here now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Had not we better go away as it is? Here are no tea-things for us, you
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No more there are, indeed. How very provoking! But I think we had
better sit still, for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd! How is my
head, my dear? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it, I am afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, it looks very nice. But, dear Mrs. Allen, are you sure
there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people? I think you
must know somebody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't, upon my word--I wish I did. I wish I had a large acquaintance
here with all my heart, and then I should get you a partner. I should be
so glad to have you dance. There goes a strange-looking woman! What an
odd gown she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has got on! How old-fashioned it is! Look at the back.''

 (<font color='red'><b>neighbours</b></font>)</div><p/>After some time they received an offer of tea from one of their
neighbours; it was thankfully accepted, and this introduced a light
conversation with the gentleman who offered it, which was the only time
that anybody spoke to them during the evening, till they were discovered
and joined by Mr. Allen when the dance was over.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), directly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have had an
agreeable ball.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very agreeable indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied, vainly endeavouring to hide a
great yawn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had been able to dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) wife; <div class="bookquote">``I wish we could
have got a partner for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>). I have been saying how glad I should be if
the Skinners were here this winter instead of last; or if the Parrys had
come, as they talked of once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) might have danced with George Parry. I
am so sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) has not had a partner!''

 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall do better another evening I hope,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Allen's
consolation.

<p/>The company began to disperse when the dancing was over--enough to leave
space for the remainder to walk about in some comfort; and now was the
time for a heroine, who had not yet played a very distinguished part
in the events of the evening, to be noticed and admired. Every five
minutes, by removing some of the crowd, gave greater openings for her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
charms. She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was now seen by many young men who had not been near her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
before. Not one, however, started with rapturous wonder on beholding
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>), no whisper of eager inquiry ran round the room, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) once
called a divinity by anybody. Yet Catherine was in very good looks, and
had the company only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) three years before, they would now have
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exceedingly handsome.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was looked at, however, and with some admiration; for, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
hearing, two gentlemen pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be a pretty girl. Such words
had their due effect; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) immediately thought the evening pleasanter
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had found it before--her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) humble vanity was contented--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a
true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) charms, and went to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) chair in good humour with everybody, and
perfectly satisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) share of public attention.




<p/>CHAPTER 3


<p/>Every morning now brought its regular duties--shops were to be visited;
some new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be
attended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at
everybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintance
in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) repeated it after
every fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) knowing nobody at
all.

<p/>They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was more
favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced to
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was Tilney.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a
pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not
quite handsome, was very near it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address was good, and Catherine
felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for speaking
while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as
agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credit for being. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked with
fluency and spirit--and there was an archness and pleasantry in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). After
chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects
around them, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with--<div class="bookquote">``I have hitherto been very
remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not
yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here
before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and
the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have been
very negligent--but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these
particulars? If you are I will begin directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No trouble, I assure you, madam.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then forming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features into a set
smile, and affectedly softening his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, with a simpering
air, <div class="bookquote">``Have you been long in Bath, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About a week, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Really!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with affected astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should you be surprised, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) natural tone. <div class="bookquote">``But some emotion must
appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed,
and not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you never
here before, madam?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you been to the theatre?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To the concert?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, on Wednesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you altogether pleased with Bath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--I like it very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head, not knowing whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might venture to
laugh. <div class="bookquote">``I see what you think of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gravely--<div class="bookquote">``I shall make but
a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My journal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower
Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings--plain black
shoes--appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a
queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and distressed
me by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nonsense.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I shall say no such thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I tell you what you ought to say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you please.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had
a great deal of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)--seems a most extraordinary
genius--hope I may know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). That, madam, is what I wish you to
say.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, perhaps, I keep no journal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by
you. These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a
journal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your
life in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of
every day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every
evening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered,
and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be
described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse to
a journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies' ways as
you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which
largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies
are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing
agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something,
but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping
a journal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have sometimes thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, doubtingly, <div class="bookquote">``whether ladies
do write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is--I should not
think the superiority was always on our side.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the
usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three
particulars.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what are they?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a
very frequent ignorance of grammar.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the
compliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better
letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better
landscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence
is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: <div class="bookquote">``My dear Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do
take this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already;
I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though
it cost but nine shillings a yard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Tilney,
looking at the muslin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you understand muslins, sir?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be an
excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a
gown. I bought one for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the other day, and it was pronounced to be a
prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five shillings a
yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) genius. <div class="bookquote">``Men commonly take so little
notice of those things,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I can never get Mr. Allen to know
one of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your
sister, sir.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland's gown?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very pretty, madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), gravely examining it; <div class="bookquote">``but I do not
think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How can you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``be so--''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had almost said
<div class="bookquote">``strange.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite of your opinion, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Allen; <div class="bookquote">``and so I told
Miss Morland when she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) bought it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other;
Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or
a cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sister
say so forty times, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been extravagant in buying more than
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We
are sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in
Salisbury, but it is so far to go--eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen
says it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than
eight; and it is such a fag--I come back tired to death. Now, here one
can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) said; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced.
Catherine feared, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) listened to their discourse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) indulged
himself a little too much with the foibles of others. <div class="bookquote">``What are you
thinking of so earnestly?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), as they walked back to the ballroom;
<div class="bookquote">``not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, your
meditations are not satisfactory.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine coloured, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I was not thinking of anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once
that you will not tell me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well then, I will not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to
tease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world
advances intimacy so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the
lady's side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the
acquaintance. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) so much, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drank her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
warm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
when there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in
a slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a
celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified
in falling in love before the gentleman's love is declared,* it must be
very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the
gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). How proper Mr. Tilney
might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen's
head, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) young charge he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was on inquiry satisfied; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had early in the
evening taken pains to know who her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) partner was, and had been assured
of Mr. Tilney's being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family in
Gloucestershire.




<p/>CHAPTER 4


<p/>With more than usual eagerness did Catherine hasten to the pump-room the
next day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the
morning were over, and ready to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) with a smile; but no smile
was demanded--Mr. Tilney did not appear. Every creature in Bath,
except himself, was to be seen in the room at different periods of the
fashionable hours; crowds of people were every moment passing in and
out, up the steps and down; people whom nobody cared about, and nobody
wanted to see; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) only was absent. <div class="bookquote">``What a delightful place Bath
is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Allen as they sat down near the great clock, after
parading the room till they were tired; <div class="bookquote">``and how pleasant it would be if
we had any acquaintance here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>This sentiment had been uttered so often in vain that Mrs. Allen had no
particular reason to hope it would be followed with more advantage now;
but we are told to <div class="bookquote">``despair of nothing we would attain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>as <div class="bookquote">``unwearied
diligence our point would gain'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>; and the unwearied diligence with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had every day wished for the same thing was at length to have its
just reward, for hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) been seated ten minutes before a lady of
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own age, who was sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), and had been looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
attentively for several minutes, addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) with great complaisance
in these words: <div class="bookquote">``I think, madam, I cannot be mistaken; it is a long time
since I had the pleasure of seeing you, but is not your name Allen?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers
to be Thorpe; and Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of
a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had seen only once since
their respective marriages, and that many years ago. Their joy on this
meeting was very great, as well it might, since they had been contented
to know nothing of each other for the last fifteen years. Compliments
on good looks now passed; and, after observing how time had slipped away
since they were last together, how little they had thought of meeting in
Bath, and what a pleasure it was to see an old friend, they proceeded to
make inquiries and give intelligence as to their families, sisters, and
cousins, talking both together, far more ready to give than to receive
information, and each hearing very little of what the other said. Mrs.
Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, over Mrs. Allen,
in a family of children; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) expatiated on the talents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
sons, and the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) daughters, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) related their different
situations and views--that John was at Oxford, Edward at Merchant
Taylors', and William at sea--and all of them more beloved and respected
in their different station than any other three beings ever were, Mrs.
Allen had no similar information to give, no similar triumphs to press
on the unwilling and unbelieving ear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend, and was forced to
sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling
herself, however, with the discovery, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) keen eye soon made, that
the lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here come my dear girls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Thorpe, pointing at three
smart-looking females who, arm in arm, were then moving towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``My
dear Mrs. Allen, I long to introduce them; they will be so delighted
to see you: the tallest is Isabella, my eldest; is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) a fine young
woman? The others are very much admired too, but I believe Isabella is
the handsomest.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Miss Thorpes were introduced; and Miss Morland, who had been for a
short time forgotten, was introduced likewise. The name seemed to strike
them all; and, after speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) with great civility, the eldest
young lady observed aloud to the rest, <div class="bookquote">``How excessively like her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother
Miss Morland is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The very picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>cried the mother--and <div class="bookquote">``I should have
known her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) anywhere for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>was repeated by them all, two or
three times over. For a moment Catherine was surprised; but Mrs. Thorpe
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) daughters had scarcely begun the history of their acquaintance
with Mr. James Morland, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) remembered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) eldest brother
had lately formed an intimacy with a young man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own college, of
the name of Thorpe; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent the last week of the Christmas
vacation with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, near London.

<p/>The whole being explained, many obliging things were said by the Miss
Thorpes of their wish of being better acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>); of being
considered as already friends, through the friendship of their brothers,
etc., which Catherine heard with pleasure, and answered with all the
pretty expressions she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could command; and, as the first proof of amity,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was soon invited to accept an arm of the eldest Miss Thorpe, and
take a turn with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) about the room. Catherine was delighted with this
extension of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) Bath acquaintance, and almost forgot Mr. Tilney while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) talked to Miss Thorpe. Friendship is certainly the finest balm for
the pangs of disappointed love.

<p/>Their conversation turned upon those subjects, of which the free
discussion has generally much to do in perfecting a sudden intimacy
between two young ladies: such as dress, balls, flirtations, and
quizzes. Miss Thorpe, however, being four years older than Miss Morland,
and at least four years better informed, had a very decided advantage in
discussing such points; she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could compare the balls of Bath with those
of Tunbridge, its fashions with the fashions of London; could rectify
the opinions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) new friend in many articles of tasteful attire;
could discover a flirtation between any gentleman and lady who only
smiled on each other; and point out a quiz through the thickness of a
crowd. These powers received due admiration from Catherine, to whom they
were entirely new; and the respect which they naturally inspired might
have been too great for familiarity, had not the easy gaiety of Miss
Thorpe's manners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) frequent expressions of delight on this
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), softened down every feeling of awe, and left
nothing but tender affection. Their increasing attachment was not to be
satisfied with half a dozen turns in the pump-room, but required, when
they all quitted it together, that Miss Thorpe should accompany Miss
Morland to the very door of Mr. Allen's house; and that they should
there part with a most affectionate and lengthened shake of hands, after
learning, to their mutual relief, that they should see each other across
the theatre at night, and say their prayers in the same chapel the next
morning. Catherine then ran directly upstairs, and watched Miss Thorpe's
progress down the street from the drawing-room window; admired the
graceful spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) walk, the fashionable air of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) figure and
dress; and felt grateful, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) might, for the chance which had
procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) such a friend.

<p/>Mrs. Thorpe was a widow, and not a very rich one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was a
good-humoured, well-meaning woman, and a very indulgent mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
eldest daughter had great personal beauty, and the younger ones, by
pretending to be as handsome as their sister, imitating her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) air, and
dressing in the same style, did very well.

<p/>This brief account of the family is intended to supersede the necessity
of a long and minute detail from Mrs. Thorpe herself, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) past
adventures and sufferings, which might otherwise be expected to occupy
the three or four following chapters; in which the worthlessness of
lords and attorneys might be set forth, and conversations, which had
passed twenty years before, be minutely repeated.




<p/>CHAPTER 5


<p/>Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening, in
returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe, though they certainly
claimed much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) leisure, as to forget to look with an inquiring eye
for Mr. Tilney in every box which her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) eye could reach; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) looked in
vain. Mr. Tilney was no fonder of the play than the pump-room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) hoped
to be more fortunate the next day; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) wishes for fine weather
were answered by seeing a beautiful morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) hardly felt a doubt of
it; for a fine Sunday in Bath empties every house of its inhabitants,
and all the world appears on such an occasion to walk about and tell
their acquaintance what a charming day it is.

<p/>As soon as divine service was over, the Thorpes and Allens eagerly
joined each other; and after staying long enough in the pump-room to
discover that the crowd was insupportable, and that there was not
a genteel face to be seen, which everybody discovers every Sunday
throughout the season, they hastened away to the Crescent, to breathe
the fresh air of better company. Here Catherine and Isabella, arm
in arm, again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved
conversation; they talked much, and with much enjoyment; but again
was Catherine disappointed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hope of reseeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) was
nowhere to be met with; every search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) was equally unsuccessful,
in morning lounges or evening assemblies; neither at the Upper nor Lower
Rooms, at dressed or undressed balls, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) perceivable; nor among the
walkers, the horsemen, or the curricle-drivers of the morning. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) name
was not in the pump-room book, and curiosity could do no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) must
be gone from Bath. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) had not mentioned that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crescent</b></font>) stay would be so
short! This sort of mysteriousness, which is always so becoming in a
hero, threw a fresh grace in Catherine's imagination around his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) person
and manners, and increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anxiety to know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>). From the
Thorpes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could learn nothing, for they had been only two days in Bath
before they met with Mrs. Allen. It was a subject, however, in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) often indulged with her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) fair friend, from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) received every
possible encouragement to continue to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) impression
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) fancy was not suffered therefore to weaken. Isabella was very
sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must be a charming young man, and was equally sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
must have been delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dear Catherine, and would therefore
shortly return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the better for being a clergyman, <div class="bookquote">``for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
must confess herself very partial to the profession'' (<font color='red'><b>a clergyman</b></font>)</div>; and something like
a sigh escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said it. Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not
demanding the cause of that gentle emotion--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not experienced
enough in the finesse of love, or the duties of friendship, to know when
delicate raillery was properly called for, or when a confidence should
be forced.

<p/>Mrs. Allen was now quite happy--quite satisfied with Bath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had found
some acquaintance, had been so lucky too as to find in them the family
of a most worthy old friend; and, as the completion of good fortune, had
found these friends by no means so expensively dressed as herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
daily expressions were no longer, <div class="bookquote">``I wish we had some acquaintance in
Bath!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were changed into, <div class="bookquote">``How glad I am we have met with Mrs.
Thorpe!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was as eager in promoting the intercourse of the two
families, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) young charge and Isabella themselves could be; never
satisfied with the day unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) spent the chief of it by the side of
Mrs. Thorpe, in what they called conversation, but in which there was
scarcely ever any exchange of opinion, and not often any resemblance of
subject, for Mrs. Thorpe talked chiefly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) children, and Mrs. Allen
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) gowns.

<p/>The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick
as its beginning had been warm, and they passed so rapidly through every
gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof
of it to be given to their friends or themselves. They called each other
by their Christian name, were always arm in arm when they walked, pinned
up each other's train for the dance, and were not to be divided in the
set; and if a rainy morning deprived them of other enjoyments, they
were still resolute in meeting in defiance of wet and dirt, and shut
themselves up, to read novels together. Yes, novels; for I will not
adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,
of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the
number of which they are themselves adding--joining with their greatest
enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely
ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages
with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the
heroine of another, from whom can she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) expect protection and regard? I
cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such
effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in
threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us
not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions
have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any
other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has
been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes
are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the
nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who
collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and
Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,
are eulogized by a thousand pens--there seems almost a general wish of
decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and
of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to
recommend them. <div class="bookquote">``I am no novel-reader--I seldom look into novels--Do not
imagine that I often read novels--It is really very well for a novel.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such is the common cant. <div class="bookquote">``And what are you reading, Miss--?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! It is
only a novel!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>replies the young lady, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lays down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) book
with affected indifference, or momentary shame. <div class="bookquote">``It is only Cecilia, or
Camilla, or Belinda'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest
powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge
of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the
liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the
best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a
volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be
against her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,
of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of
taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement
of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of
conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,
too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age
that could endure it.




<p/>CHAPTER 6


<p/>The following conversation, which took place between the two friends in
the pump-room one morning, after an acquaintance of eight or nine
days, is given as a specimen of their very warm attachment, and of the
delicacy, discretion, originality of thought, and literary taste which
marked the reasonableness of that attachment.

<p/>They met by appointment; and as Isabella had arrived nearly five
minutes before her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) first address naturally was, <div class="bookquote">``My dearest
creature, what can have made you so late? I have been waiting for you at
least this age!''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend address</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, indeed! I am very sorry for it; but really I thought I was in
very good time. It is but just one. I hope you have not been here long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! These ten ages at least. I am sure I have been here this half hour.
But now, let us go and sit down at the other end of the room, and enjoy
ourselves. I have an hundred things to say to you. In the first place,
I was so afraid it would rain this morning, just as I wanted to set off;
it looked very showery, and that would have thrown me into agonies! Do
you know, I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine, in a shop window in
Milsom Street just now--very like yours, only with coquelicot ribbons
instead of green; I quite longed for it. But, my dearest Catherine, what
have you been doing with yourself all this morning? Have you gone on
with Udolpho?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have been reading it ever since I woke; and I am got to the
black veil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! I would not tell you what is
behind the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Yes, quite; what can it be? But do not tell me--I would not be
told upon any account. I know it must be a skeleton, I am sure it is
Laurentina's skeleton. Oh! I am delighted with the book! I should like
to spend my whole life in reading it. I assure you, if it had not been
to meet you, I would not have come away from it for all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear creature! How much I am obliged to you; and when you have finished
Udolpho, we will read the Italian together; and I have made out a list
of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you, indeed! How glad I am! What are they all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will read you their names directly; here they are, in my pocketbook.
Castle of Wolfenbach, Clermont, Mysterious Warnings, Necromancer of the
Black Forest, Midnight Bell, Orphan of the Rhine, and Horrid Mysteries.
Those will last us some time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, pretty well; but are they all horrid, are you sure they are all
horrid?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite sure; for a particular friend of mine, a Miss Andrews, a
sweet girl, one of the sweetest creatures in the world, has read every
one of them. I wish you knew Miss Andrews, you would be delighted with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive. I think
her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) as beautiful as an angel, and I am so vexed with the men for not
admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)! I scold them all amazingly about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Scold them! Do you scold them for not admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that I do. There is nothing I would not do for those who are
really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is
not my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong. I told
Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was to
tease me all night, I would not dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) would allow
Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel. The men think us incapable
of real friendship, you know, and I am determined to show them the
difference. Now, if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you, I
should fire up in a moment: but that is not at all likely, for you are
just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, colouring. <div class="bookquote">``How can you say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you very well; you have so much animation, which is exactly
what Miss Andrews wants, for I must confess there is something amazingly
insipid about her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>). Oh! I must tell you, that just after we parted
yesterday, I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly--I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
is in love with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine coloured, and disclaimed again. Isabella
laughed. <div class="bookquote">``It is very true, upon my honour, but I see how it is; you are
indifferent to everybody's admiration, except that of one gentleman,
who shall be nameless. Nay, I cannot blame you'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--speaking more
seriously--<div class="bookquote">``your feelings are easily understood. Where the heart is
really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the
attention of anybody else. Everything is so insipid, so uninteresting,
that does not relate to the beloved object! I can perfectly comprehend
your feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr.
Tilney, for perhaps I may never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) again! My dearest creature, do not talk of it. I am sure
you would be miserable if you thought so!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I should not. I do not pretend to say that I was not very
much pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); but while I have Udolpho to read, I feel as if
nobody could make me miserable. Oh! The dreadful black veil! My dear
Isabella, I am sure there must be Laurentina's skeleton behind it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is so odd to me, that you should never have read Udolpho before; but
I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) does not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself;
but new books do not fall in our way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir Charles Grandison! That is an amazing horrid book, is it not? I
remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not like Udolpho at all; but yet I think it is very
entertaining.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you indeed! You surprise me; I thought it had not been readable.
But, my dearest Catherine, have you settled what to wear on your head
tonight? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you.
The men take notice of that sometimes, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it does not signify if they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, very innocently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signify! Oh, heavens! I make it a rule never to mind what they say.
They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with
spirit, and make them keep their distance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they? Well, I never observed that. They always behave very well to
me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! They give themselves such airs. They are the most conceited
creatures in the world, and think themselves of so much importance!
By the by, though I have thought of it a hundred times, I have always
forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man. Do you
like them best dark or fair?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly know. I never much thought about it. Something between both, I
think. Brown--not fair, and--and not very dark.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, Catherine. That is exactly he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>). I have not forgot your
description of Mr. Tilney--`a brown skin, with dark eyes, and rather
dark hair.' Well, my taste is different. I prefer light eyes, and as to
complexion--do you know--I like a sallow better than any other. You must
not betray me, if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance
answering that description.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Betray you! What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, do not distress me. I believe I have said too much. Let us drop
the subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, in some amazement, complied, and after remaining a few
moments silent, was on the point of reverting to what interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
at that time rather more than anything else in the world, Laurentina's
skeleton, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), by saying, <div class="bookquote">``For heaven's sake!
Let us move away from this end of the room. Do you know, there are two
odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour. They really
put me quite out of countenance. Let us go and look at the arrivals.
They will hardly follow us there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Away they walked to the book; and while Isabella examined the names, it
was Catherine's employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming
young men.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not coming this way, are they? I hope they are not so
impertinent as to follow us. Pray let me know if they are coming. I am
determined I will not look up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>In a few moments Catherine, with unaffected pleasure, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) need not be longer uneasy, as the gentlemen had just left the
pump-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And which way are they gone?''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, turning hastily round.
<div class="bookquote">``One was a very good-looking young man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They went towards the church-yard.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them! And now, what say you
to going to Edgar's Buildings with me, and looking at my new hat? You
said you should like to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine readily agreed. <div class="bookquote">``Only,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps we may overtake
the two young men.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Never mind that. If we make haste, we shall pass by them presently,
and I am dying to show you my hat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But if we only wait a few minutes, there will be no danger of our
seeing them at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall not pay them any such compliment, I assure you. I have no
notion of treating men with such respect. That is the way to spoil
them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning; and therefore,
to show the independence of Miss Thorpe, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) resolution of humbling
the sex, they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuit
of the two young men.




<p/>CHAPTER 7


<p/>Half a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway,
opposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped. Everybody acquainted
with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap Street at
this point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature, so
unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and the
principal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties of
ladies, however important their business, whether in quest of pastry,
millinery, or even -LRB-as in the present case-RRB- of young men, are not
detained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts. This
evil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by Isabella
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) residence in Bath; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was now fated to feel and lament it
once more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union Passage,
and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding through the
crowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting alley, they
were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven along on bad
pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the vehemence that
could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) companion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)
horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, these odious gigs!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, looking up. <div class="bookquote">``How I detest them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
looked again and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Delightful! Mr. Morland and my brother!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven! `Tis James!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>was uttered at the same moment by Catherine;
and, on catching the young men's eyes, the horse was immediately checked
with a violence which almost threw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) haunches, and the servant
having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the equipage was
delivered to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) care.

<p/>Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother with the liveliest pleasure; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), being of a very amiable
disposition, and sincerely attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), gave every proof on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
side of equal satisfaction, which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have leisure to do, while the
bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) notice;
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and
embarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) been more
expert in the development of other people's feelings, and less simply
engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend quite as
pretty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could do herself.

<p/>John Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the
horses, soon joined them, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly received the amends
which were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) due; for while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) slightly and carelessly touched the
hand of Isabella, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) bestowed a whole scrape and half a short
bow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain face
and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) wore
the dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were easy
where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ought to be civil, and impudent where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be allowed to be
easy. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watch: <div class="bookquote">``How long do you think we have been running
it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know the distance.''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother told her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) that it was
twenty-three miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Three and twenty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Thorpe. <div class="bookquote">``Five and twenty if it is an inch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers,
and milestones; but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) friend disregarded them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a surer test
of distance. <div class="bookquote">``I know it must be five and twenty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``by the time
we have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of the
inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any man
in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness;
that makes it exactly twenty-five.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have lost an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Morland; <div class="bookquote">``it was only ten o’clock when we
came from Tetbury.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten o’clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This
brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do
but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in
your life?''  (<font color='red'><b>The servant</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving
off.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only
three and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible
if you can.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does look very hot, to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hot! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look
at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) forehand; look at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loins; only see how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) moves; that horse
cannot go less than ten miles an hour: tie his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) legs and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will get on.
What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it?
Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a
Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ran
it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with it.
I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind,
though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I chanced to
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) on Magdalen Bridge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was driving into Oxford, last term:
`Ah! Thorpe,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), `do you happen to want such a little thing as
this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired of it.'
`Oh! D--,' said I; `I am your man; what do you ask?' And how much do you
think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, Miss Morland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I cannot guess at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,
lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good
as new, or better. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked fifty guineas; I closed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly,
threw down the money, and the carriage was mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``I know so little of such things that I
cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Neither one nor t'other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but
I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was very good-natured of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, quite pleased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! D-- it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend,
I hate to be pitiful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young
ladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that
the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay their
respects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and so
well satisfied was the latter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lot, so contentedly was she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) who brought the double
recommendation of being her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother's friend, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend's brother,
so pure and uncoquettish were her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) feelings, that, though they overtook
and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was so far
from seeking to attract their notice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looked back at them only
three times.

<p/>John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes'
silence, renewed the conversation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) gig. <div class="bookquote">``You will find,
however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some
people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day;
Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the
time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Morland, who overheard this; <div class="bookquote">``but you forget that your horse
was included.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My horse! Oh, d-- it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are
you fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am
particularly fond of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the
propriety of accepting such an offer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rest! He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense;
nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon.
No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day
while I am here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall you indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine very seriously. <div class="bookquote">``That will be forty
miles a day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown
tomorrow; mind, I am engaged.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How delightful that will be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Isabella, turning round. <div class="bookquote">``My
dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will
not have room for a third.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters
about; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but
Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion's
discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than
a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every
woman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as long as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful female
mind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that
of a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own sex is
concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which
had been long uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts; it was, <div class="bookquote">``Have you ever read
Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?''

 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else to
do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) question,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Novels are all so full of nonsense
and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since
Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t'other day; but as for all the
others, they are the stupidest things in creation.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very
interesting.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe's; her (<font color='blue'><b>Radcliffe</b></font>)
novels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature
in them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with some
hesitation, from the fear of mortifying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that
other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who married the French emigrant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you mean Camilla?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at
see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon
found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be
before I saw it: as soon as I heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had married an emigrant, I was
sure I should never be able to get through it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never read it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can
imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man's playing at
see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor
Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe's lodgings, and the
feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way
to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs.
Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Mother!
How do you do?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) a hearty shake of the hand. <div class="bookquote">``Where
did you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch.
Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must look
out for a couple of good beds somewhere near.''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>And this address seemed
to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother's heart, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
received him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
two younger sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) then bestowed an equal portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fraternal
tenderness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked each of them how they did, and observed that
they both looked very ugly.

<p/>These manners did not please Catherine; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was James's friend
and Isabella's brother; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) judgment was further bought off by
Isabella's assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), when they withdrew to see the new hat, that
John thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) the most charming girl in the world, and by John's
engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) before they parted to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that evening. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where
youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of
reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl
in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the
consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with
the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen's, and James, as
the door was closed on them, said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Catherine, how do you like my
friend Thorpe?''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div>instead of answering, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) probably would have done,
had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, <div class="bookquote">``I do not like
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) directly replied, <div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) very much; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seems very
agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle; but
that will recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to your sex, I believe: and how do you like the
rest of the family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear you say so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is just the kind of young woman
I could wish to see you attached to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has so much good sense, and is
so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>);
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) seems very fond of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) said the highest things in your
praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss
Thorpe even you, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand with affection, <div class="bookquote">``may be
proud of.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exceedingly, and am delighted
to find that you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too. You hardly mentioned anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) when
you wrote to me after your visit there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a
great deal together while you are in Bath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is a most amiable girl;
such a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
is evidently the general favourite; and how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must be admired in
such a place as this--is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the prettiest girl
in Bath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of
beauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here, my
dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe, it
would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am sure,
are very kind to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it
will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far
on purpose to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) conscience
for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed,
Catherine, I love you dearly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the
situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now
passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression
on James's part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney
Street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs. Allen,
invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the latter
to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and tippet.
A pre-engagement in Edgar's Buildings prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) accepting the
invitation of one friend, and obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to hurry away as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>)
had satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties
uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was then
left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened imagination
over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns of dressing
and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen's fears on the delay of an
expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even
on the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own felicity, in being already engaged for the
evening.




<p/>CHAPTER 8


<p/>In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from Pulteney
Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time. The Thorpes and James
Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella having
gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend with the most
smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) gown, and
envying the curl of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hair, they followed their chaperones, arm in
arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought
occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the hand
or a smile of affection.

<p/>The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and
James, who had been engaged quite as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sister, was very
importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the
card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) declared, should induce
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to join the set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dear Catherine could join it too. <div class="bookquote">``I
assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I would not stand up without your dear sister
for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated the
whole evening.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude, and
they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when Isabella, who
had been talking to James on the other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), turned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
sister and whispered, <div class="bookquote">``My dear creature, I am afraid I must leave you,
your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin; I know you will not
mind my going away, and I dare say John will be back in a moment,
and then you may easily find me out.''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Catherine, though a little
disappointed, had too much good nature to make any opposition, and the
others rising up, Isabella had only time to press her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend's hand and
say, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my dear love,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>before they hurried off. The younger
Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs.
Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) now remained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could not help
being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr. Thorpe, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) not only longed
to be dancing, but was likewise aware that, as the real dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
situation could not be known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was sharing with the scores of other
young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner.
To be disgraced in the eye of the world, to wear the appearance of
infamy while her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) heart is all purity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) actions all innocence, and the
misconduct of another the true source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) debasement, is one of those
circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine's life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) character. Catherine
had fortitude too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suffered, but no murmur passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips.

<p/>From this state of humiliation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was roused, at the end of ten
minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr.
Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) seemed to be
moving that way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and therefore the smile and the
blush, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed away
without sullying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heroic importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked as handsome and as
lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and
pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) arm, and whom Catherine
immediately guessed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away
a fair opportunity of considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forever, by being
married already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it
had never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not
behaved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not talked, like the married men to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been
used; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never mentioned a wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had acknowledged a sister.
From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister's
now being by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike
paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen's bosom, Catherine sat
erect, in the perfect use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) senses, and with cheeks only a little
redder than usual.

<p/>Mr. Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) companion, who continued, though slowly, to approach,
were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs. Thorpe; and
this lady stopping to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), they, as belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), stopped
likewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney's eye, instantly received
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) the smiling tribute of recognition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) returned it with
pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spoke both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and Mrs.
Allen, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was very civilly acknowledged. <div class="bookquote">``I am very happy to see
you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had left Bath.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had quitted it for a week, on the very
morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) having had the pleasure of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it
is just the place for young people--and indeed for everybody else too.
I tell Mr. Allen, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is
much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is quite in luck to be sent here for his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) health.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place,
from finding it of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) will. A neighbour of ours,
Dr. Skinner, was here for his (<font color='blue'><b>Skinner</b></font>) health last winter, and came away quite
stout.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That circumstance must give great encouragement.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir--and Dr. Skinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skinner</b></font>) family were here three months; so I
tell Mr. Allen he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) must not be in a hurry to get away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney
with seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was accordingly
done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a
few minutes' consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) asked Catherine to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). This
compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the
lady; and in giving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) denial, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sorrow on the occasion
so very much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
sufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) then told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) waiting did not by any means reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) more
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) lot; nor did the particulars which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) entered into while they
were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had just
left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
so much as to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) looking very often towards that part of the
room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had left Mr. Tilney. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) dear Isabella, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
particularly longed to point out that gentleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could see nothing.
They were in different sets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was separated from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) party, and
away from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) acquaintance; one mortification succeeded another,
and from the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously
engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or
enjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round,
perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>), attended by Miss Tilney and
a gentleman. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for this
liberty--but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this
young lady by you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature
in the room more happy to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) than Catherine. The young ladies
were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of
such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind
making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having
so respectably settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) young charge, returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) party.

<p/>Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable
countenance; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) air, though it had not all the decided pretension,
the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe's, had more real elegance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor
affectedly open; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seemed capable of being young, attractive, and
at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>),
and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable
vexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at
once by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appearance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous
of being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and readily talked therefore whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying
it. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by
the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their
doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance, by
informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admired
its buildings and surrounding country, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew, or played, or
sang, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was fond of riding on horseback.

<p/>The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm
gently seized by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,
<div class="bookquote">``At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for
you this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you
knew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could not
even see where you were.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So I told your brother all the time--but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not believe me. Do go
and see for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), Mr. Morland, said I--but all in vain--he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) would not stir
an inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so immoderately
lazy! I have been scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to such a degree, my dear Catherine, you
would be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon ceremony with such
people.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at that young lady with the white beads round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>whispered
Catherine, detaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend from James. <div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Tilney's sister.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Heavens! You don't say so! Let me look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) this moment. What a
delightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) all-conquering brother? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in the room? Point him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) out to me this
instant, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is. I die to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Mr. Morland, you are not to listen.
We are not talking about you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless
curiosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! `Tis nothing. But be
satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to
you, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you; therefore
I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear something
not very agreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original
subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well
pleased to have it dropped for a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not avoid a little
suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire to
see Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would
have led his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fair partner away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) resisted. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, Mr.
Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I would not do such a thing for all the world.
How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your
brother wants me to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants me to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again, though
I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the
rules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change
partners.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div>said James, <div class="bookquote">``in these public assemblies, it is as
often done as not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry,
you never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me; persuade
your brother how impossible it is. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it would quite shock
you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better change.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Isabella, <div class="bookquote">``you hear what your sister says, and yet you
will not mind her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set all
the old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest Catherine,
for heaven's sake, and stand by me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>And off they went, to regain
their former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked away; and
Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of repeating
the agreeable request which had already flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) once, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could, in the hope
of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) still with them--a hope which, when it proved to be
fruitless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) felt to have been highly unreasonable. <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you have had
an agreeable partner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very agreeable, madam.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Allen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was with us just now, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was so tired of lounging about,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would ask
you, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) met with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, looking round; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not looked
round long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) leading a young lady to the dance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) has got a partner; I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had asked you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Allen;
and after a short silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is a very agreeable young
man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is, Mrs. Allen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; <div class="bookquote">``I
must say it, though I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mother, that there is not a more agreeable
young man in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension
of many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment's
consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) said, in a whisper to Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
thought I was speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was disappointed and vexed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to have missed by so
little the very object she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had had in view; and this persuasion did not
incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
soon afterwards and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are
to stand up and jig it together again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and,
besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with
me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two
younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this
half hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Again Catherine excused herself; and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) walked off to quiz his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
sisters by himself. The rest of the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found very dull; Mr.
Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
partner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), and
James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the
latter had no leisure to bestow more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend than one smile, one
squeeze, and one <div class="bookquote">``dearest Catherine.''




 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER 9


<p/>The progress of Catherine's unhappiness from the events of the evening
was as follows. It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with
everybody about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained in the rooms, which speedily
brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home. This,
on arriving in Pulteney Street, took the direction of extraordinary
hunger, and when that was appeased, changed into an earnest longing to
be in bed; such was the extreme point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress; for when there
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours, and
from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) awoke perfectly revived, in excellent spirits, with fresh
hopes and fresh schemes. The first wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart was to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
acquaintance with Miss Tilney, and almost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first resolution, to seek
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for that purpose, in the pump-room at noon. In the pump-room, one
so newly arrived in Bath must be met with, and that building she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence,
and the completion of female intimacy, so admirably adapted for secret
discourses and unlimited confidence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was most reasonably
encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) plan
for the morning thus settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat quietly down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) book after
breakfast, resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment
till the clock struck one; and from habitude very little incommoded by
the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs. Allen, whose vacancy of mind and
incapacity for thinking were such, that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) never talked a great
deal, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could never be entirely silent; and, therefore, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) work, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) needle or broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) thread, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
heard a carriage in the street, or saw a speck upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) gown, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) must
observe it aloud, whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) or
not. At about half past twelve, a remarkably loud rap drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) in haste
to the window, and scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) time to inform Catherine of there
being two open carriages at the door, in the first only a servant,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second, before John Thorpe came
running upstairs, calling out, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Morland, here I am. Have
you been waiting long? We could not come before; the old devil of a
coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into,
and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out
of the street. How do you do, Mrs. Allen? A famous ball last night, was
not it? Come, Miss Morland, be quick, for the others are in a confounded
hurry to be off. They want to get their tumble over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Where are you all going to?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Going to? Why, you have not forgot our engagement! Did not we agree
together to take a drive this morning? What a head you have! We are
going up Claverton Down.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Something was said about it, I remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, looking at
Mrs. Allen for her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) opinion; <div class="bookquote">``but really I did not expect you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not expect me! That's a good one! And what a dust you would have made,
if I had not come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's silent appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend, meanwhile, was entirely thrown
away, for Mrs. Allen, not being at all in the habit of conveying any
expression herself by a look, was not aware of its being ever intended
by anybody else; and Catherine, whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again
could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive, and who
thought there could be no impropriety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) going with Mr. Thorpe, as
Isabella was going at the same time with James, was therefore obliged to
speak plainer. <div class="bookquote">``Well, ma’am, what do you say to it? Can you spare me for
an hour or two? Shall I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do just as you please, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Allen, with the most
placid indifference. Catherine took the advice, and ran off to get
ready. In a very few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reappeared, having scarcely allowed
the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
praise, after Thorpe had procured Mrs. Allen's admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) gig;
and then receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) friend's parting good wishes, they both hurried
downstairs. <div class="bookquote">``My dearest creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Isabella, to whom the duty
of friendship immediately called her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could get into the
carriage, <div class="bookquote">``you have been at least three hours getting ready. I was
afraid you were ill. What a delightful ball we had last night. I have a
thousand things to say to you; but make haste and get in, for I long to
be off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) orders and turned away, but not too soon to hear
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend exclaim aloud to James, <div class="bookquote">``What a sweet girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is! I quite
dote on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You will not be frightened, Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Thorpe, as he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) handed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) in, <div class="bookquote">``if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off.
He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will, most likely, give a plunge or two, and perhaps take the rest
for a minute; but he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will soon know his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) master. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is full of spirits,
playful as can be, but there is no vice in him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one, but it was too
late to retreat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was too young to own herself frightened; so,
resigning herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fate, and trusting to the animal's boasted
knowledge of its owner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat peaceably down, and saw Thorpe sit down
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). Everything being then arranged, the servant who stood at the
horse's head was bid in an important voice <div class="bookquote">``to let him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>and off they
went in the quietest manner imaginable, without a plunge or a caper, or
anything like one. Catherine, delighted at so happy an escape, spoke
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pleasure aloud with grateful surprise; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion immediately
made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that it was entirely
owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had then held the
reins, and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had
directed his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) whip. Catherine, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not help wondering that
with such perfect command of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) should think it necessary to
alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with a relation of its tricks, congratulated herself sincerely
on being under the care of so excellent a coachman; and perceiving that
the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner, without
showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity, and
-LRB-considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour-RRB- by no means
alarmingly fast, gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and
exercise of the most invigorating kind, in a fine mild day of February,
with the consciousness of safety. A silence of several minutes succeeded
their first short dialogue; it was broken by Thorpe's saying very
abruptly, <div class="bookquote">``Old Allen is as rich as a Jew--is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>Catherine did not
understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) question, adding in explanation,
<div class="bookquote">``Old Allen, the man you are with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Allen, you mean. Yes, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is very rich.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And no children at all?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No--not any.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A famous thing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) next heirs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is your godfather, is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My godfather! No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you are always very much with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that is what I meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) seems a good kind of old fellow enough,
and has lived very well in his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) time, I dare say; he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is not gouty for
nothing. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) drink his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) bottle a day now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) bottle a day! No. Why should you think of such a thing? He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is a
very temperate man, and you could not fancy him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) in liquor last night?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord help you! You women are always thinking of men's being in liquor.
Why, you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle? I am sure of
this--that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day, there would not
be half the disorders in the world there are now. It would be a famous
good thing for us all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot believe it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Lord, it would be the saving of thousands. There is not the
hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to
be. Our foggy climate wants help.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in
Oxford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oxford! There is no drinking at Oxford now, I assure you. Nobody drinks
there. You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) four pints
at the utmost. Now, for instance, it was reckoned a remarkable thing, at
the last party in my rooms, that upon an average we cleared about five
pints a head. It was looked upon as something out of the common way.
Mine is famous good stuff, to be sure. You would not often meet with
anything like it in Oxford--and that may account for it. But this will
just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it does give a notion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine warmly, <div class="bookquote">``and that is, that
you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did. However, I
am sure James does not drink so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply, of which
no part was very distinct, except the frequent exclamations, amounting
almost to oaths, which adorned it, and Catherine was left, when it
ended, with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal
of wine drunk in Oxford, and the same happy conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother's
comparative sobriety.

<p/>Thorpe's ideas then all reverted to the merits of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own equipage, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse
moved along, and the ease which his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) paces, as well as the excellence of
the springs, gave the motion of the carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in all
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) admiration as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could. To go before or beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was
impossible. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knowledge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ignorance of the subject, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rapidity
of expression, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) diffidence of herself put that out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) power;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could strike out nothing new in commendation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) readily echoed
whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chose to assert, and it was finally settled between them
without any difficulty that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) equipage was altogether the most
complete of its kind in England, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carriage the neatest, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse the
best goer, and himself the best coachman. <div class="bookquote">``You do not really think,
Mr. Thorpe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, venturing after some time to consider the
matter as entirely decided, and to offer some little variation on the
subject, <div class="bookquote">``that James's gig will break down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Break down! Oh! Lord! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in
your life? There is not a sound piece of iron about it. The wheels have
been fairly worn out these ten years at least--and as for the body! Upon
my soul, you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch. It is the
most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld! Thank God! we
have got a better. I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty
thousand pounds.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heavens!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, quite frightened. <div class="bookquote">``Then pray let us
turn back; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on. Do let
us turn back, Mr. Thorpe; stop and speak to my brother, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) how
very unsafe it is.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unsafe! Oh, lord! What is there in that? They will only get a roll if
it does break down; and there is plenty of dirt; it will be excellent
falling. Oh, curse it! The carriage is safe enough, if a man knows how
to drive it; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty
years after it is fairly worn out. Lord bless you! I would undertake for
five pounds to drive it to York and back again, without losing a nail.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine listened with astonishment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not how to reconcile two
such very different accounts of the same thing; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not been
brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle, nor to know to
how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity
will lead. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own family were plain, matter-of-fact people who seldom
aimed at wit of any kind; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father, at the utmost, being contented
with a pun, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother with a proverb; they were not in the habit
therefore of telling lies to increase their importance, or of asserting
at one moment what they would contradict the next. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reflected on the
affair for some time in much perplexity, and was more than once on the
point of requesting from Mr. Thorpe a clearer insight into his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) real
opinion on the subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) checked herself, because it appeared to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) did not excel in giving those clearer insights, in making
those things plain which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had before made ambiguous; and, joining to
this, the consideration that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) would not really suffer his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) sister and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) friend to be exposed to a danger from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) might easily preserve
them, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) concluded at last that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) must know the carriage to be in fact
perfectly safe, and therefore would alarm herself no longer. By him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
the whole matter seemed entirely forgotten; and all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
conversation, or rather talk, began and ended with himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own
concerns. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of horses which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had bought for a trifle and
sold for incredible sums; of racing matches, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) judgment had
infallibly foretold the winner; of shooting parties, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had
killed more birds -LRB-though without having one good shot-RRB- than all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
companions together; and described to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) some famous day's sport, with
the fox-hounds, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) foresight and skill in directing the dogs
had repaired the mistakes of the most experienced huntsman, and in which
the boldness of his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) riding, though it had never endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) own life
for a moment, had been constantly leading others into difficulties,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) calmly concluded had broken the necks of many.

<p/>Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself, and unfixed
as were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) general notions of what men ought to be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not
entirely repress a doubt, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bore with the effusions of his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>)
endless conceit, of his (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) being altogether completely agreeable. It was a
bold surmise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>huntsman</b></font>) was Isabella's brother; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been assured by
James that his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) manners would recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) sex; but in spite
of this, the extreme weariness of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) company, which crept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
before they had been out an hour, and which continued unceasingly to
increase till they stopped in Pulteney Street again, induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), in
some small degree, to resist such high authority, and to distrust his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
powers of giving universal pleasure.

<p/>When they arrived at Mrs. Allen's door, the astonishment of Isabella was
hardly to be expressed, on finding that it was too late in the day for
them to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend into the house: <div class="bookquote">``Past three o’clock!''  (<font color='red'><b>friend o’clock</b></font>)</div>It was
inconceivable, incredible, impossible! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would neither believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
own watch, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother's, nor the servant's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would believe no
assurance of it founded on reason or reality, till Morland produced his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
watch, and ascertained the fact; to have doubted a moment longer then
would have been equally inconceivable, incredible, and impossible; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could only protest, over and over again, that no two hours and a
half had ever gone off so swiftly before, as Catherine was called on to
confirm; Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella;
but the latter was spared the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend's dissenting voice,
by not waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own feelings entirely engrossed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wretchedness was most acute on finding herself obliged to go
directly home. It was ages since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had had a moment's conversation
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dearest Catherine; and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had such thousands of things
to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), it appeared as if they were never to be together again;
so, with smiles of most exquisite misery, and the laughing eye of utter
despondency, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend adieu and went on.

<p/>Catherine found Mrs. Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of
the morning, and was immediately greeted with, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, here
you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>a truth which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no greater inclination than power to
dispute; <div class="bookquote">``and I hope you have had a pleasant airing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, ma’am, I thank you; we could not have had a nicer day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So Mrs. Thorpe said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was vastly pleased at your all going.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have seen Mrs. Thorpe, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I went to the pump-room as soon as you were gone, and there I met
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), and we had a great deal of talk together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) says there was hardly
any veal to be got at market this morning, it is so uncommonly scarce.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent, and there we met Mrs.
Hughes, and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you indeed? And did they speak to you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour. They seem
very agreeable people. Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted
muslin, and I fancy, by what I can learn, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) always dresses very
handsomely. Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) tell you of them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! A vast deal indeed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) hardly talked of anything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) did; but I cannot recollect now. But they are very good kind
of people, and very rich. Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>)
and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows; and Miss Drummond had a very large
fortune; and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) married, her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) twenty thousand
pounds, and five hundred to buy wedding-clothes. Mrs. Hughes saw all the
clothes after they came from the warehouse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I fancy they are, but I am not quite certain. Upon recollection,
however, I have a notion they are both dead; at least the mother is;
yes, I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead, because Mrs. Hughes told me there
was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummond</b></font>) daughter
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) wedding-day and that Miss Tilney has got now, for they were put
by for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mother died.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is Mr. Tilney, my partner, the only son?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot be quite positive about that, my dear; I have some idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is;
but, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is a very fine young man, Mrs. Hughes says, and likely
to do very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine inquired no further; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had heard enough to feel that
Mrs. Allen had no real intelligence to give, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was most
particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with
both brother and sister. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) have foreseen such a circumstance,
nothing should have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to go out with the others; and, as
it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could only lament her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ill luck, and think over what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
lost, till it was clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that the drive had by no means been very
pleasant and that John Thorpe himself was quite disagreeable.




<p/>CHAPTER 10


<p/>The Allens, Thorpes, and Morlands all met in the evening at the
theatre; and, as Catherine and Isabella sat together, there was then an
opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand
things which had been collecting within her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for communication in the
immeasurable length of time which had divided them. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, heavens!
My beloved Catherine, have I got you at last?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) address on
Catherine's entering the box and sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on the other side, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not speak another word
to you all the rest of the evening; so I charge you not to expect it. My
sweetest Catherine, how have you been this long age? But I need not ask
you, for you look delightfully. You really have done your hair in a
more heavenly style than ever; you mischievous creature, do you want to
attract everybody? I assure you, my brother is quite in love with you
already; and as for Mr. Tilney--but that is a settled thing--even your
modesty cannot doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) attachment now; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) coming back to Bath makes
it too plain. Oh! What would not I give to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)! I really am quite
wild with impatience. My mother says he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is the most delightful young man
in the world; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) this morning, you know; you must introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
to me. Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) in the house now? Look about, for heaven's sake! I assure
you, I can hardly exist till I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is not here; I cannot see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) anywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, horrid! Am I never to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)? How do you like my
gown? I think it does not look amiss; the sleeves were entirely my own
thought. Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother
and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well to be
here for a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found
out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to
every other place; really, our opinions were so exactly the same, it was
quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I
would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am
sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed I should not.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes you would indeed; I know you better than you know yourself. You
would have told us that we seemed born for each other, or some nonsense
of that kind, which would have distressed me beyond conception; my
cheeks would have been as red as your roses; I would not have had you by
for the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you do me injustice; I would not have made so improper a remark
upon any account; and besides, I am sure it would never have entered my
head.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella smiled incredulously and talked the rest of the evening to
James.

<p/>Catherine's resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again
continued in full force the next morning; and till the usual moment of
going to the pump-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt some alarm from the dread of a second
prevention. But nothing of that kind occurred, no visitors appeared to
delay them, and they all three set off in good time for the pump-room,
where the ordinary course of events and conversation took place; Mr.
Allen, after drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) glass of water, joined some gentlemen to
talk over the politics of the day and compare the accounts of their
newspapers; and the ladies walked about together, noticing every new
face, and almost every new bonnet in the room. The female part of the
Thorpe family, attended by James Morland, appeared among the crowd in
less than a quarter of an hour, and Catherine immediately took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
usual place by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend. James, who was now in constant
attendance, maintained a similar position, and separating themselves
from the rest of their party, they walked in that manner for some
time, till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which,
confining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend and brother, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very
little share in the notice of either. They were always engaged in
some sentimental discussion or lively dispute, but their sentiment was
conveyed in such whispering voices, and their vivacity attended with
so much laughter, that though Catherine's supporting opinion was not
unfrequently called for by one or the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was never able to give
any, from not having heard a word of the subject. At length however
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was empowered to disengage herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, by the avowed
necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) most joyfully saw just
entering the room with Mrs. Hughes, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) instantly joined, with
a firmer determination to be acquainted, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) might have had courage
to command, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) not been urged by the disappointment of the day
before. Miss Tilney met her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) with great civility, returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) advances
with equal goodwill, and they continued talking together as long as
both parties remained in the room; and though in all probability not
an observation was made, nor an expression used by either which had not
been made and used some thousands of times before, under that roof, in
every Bath season, yet the merit of their being spoken with simplicity
and truth, and without personal conceit, might be something uncommon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How well your brother dances!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>was an artless exclamation of
Catherine's towards the close of their conversation, which at once
surprised and amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied with a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does dance very well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other
evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw me sitting down. But I really had been engaged
the whole day to Mr. Thorpe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>Miss Tilney could only bow. <div class="bookquote">``You cannot
think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>added Catherine after a moment's silence, <div class="bookquote">``how surprised I was
to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) again. I felt so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) being quite gone away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was in Bath but
for a couple of days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) came only to engage lodgings for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That never occurred to me; and of course, not seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) anywhere, I
thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must be gone. Was not the young lady he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) danced with on Monday
a Miss Smith?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) was very glad to dance. Do you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) pretty?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) never comes to the pump-room, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sometimes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has rid out this morning with my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Hughes</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Hughes now joined them, and asked Miss Tilney if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was ready to
go. <div class="bookquote">``I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said
Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we--Yes, I think we certainly shall.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad of it, for we shall all be there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This civility was duly
returned; and they parted--on Miss Tilney's side with some knowledge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) new acquaintance's feelings, and on Catherine's, without the
smallest consciousness of having explained them.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went home very happy. The morning had answered all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hopes, and
the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation,
the future good. What gown and what head-dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should wear on the
occasion became her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chief concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cannot be justified in it. Dress
is at all times a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude about
it often destroys its own aim. Catherine knew all this very well; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
great aunt had read her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a lecture on the subject only the Christmas
before; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spotted and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tamboured muslin, and nothing but the
shortness of the time prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) buying a new one for the evening.
This would have been an error in judgment, great though not uncommon,
from which one of the other sex rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, a brother rather
than a great aunt, might have warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), for man only can be aware of
the insensibility of man towards a new gown. It would be mortifying to
the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little
the heart of man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire;
how little it is biased by the texture of their muslin, and how
unsusceptible of peculiar tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged,
the mull, or the jackonet. Woman is fine for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) own satisfaction alone.
No man will admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) the more, no woman will like her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) the better for
it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of
shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter. But not
one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different
from what had attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thither the Monday before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had then been
exulting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) engagement to Thorpe, and was now chiefly anxious to
avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
not, dared not expect that Mr. Tilney should ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a third time to
dance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wishes, hopes, and plans all centred in nothing less. Every
young lady may feel for my heroine in this critical moment, for every
young lady has at some time or other known the same agitation. All have
been, or at least all have believed themselves to be, in danger from the
pursuit of someone whom they wished to avoid; and all have been anxious
for the attentions of someone whom they wished to please. As soon as
they were joined by the Thorpes, Catherine's agony began; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fidgeted
about if John Thorpe came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), hid herself as much as possible
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) view, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pretended not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). The
cotillions were over, the country-dancing beginning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw nothing
of the Tilneys.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not be frightened, my dear Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>whispered Isabella, <div class="bookquote">``but I am
really going to dance with your brother again. I declare positively it
is quite shocking. I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ought to be ashamed of himself, but you
and John must keep us in countenance. Make haste, my dear creature, and
come to us. John is just walked off, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will be back in a moment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer. The others walked
away, John Thorpe was still in view, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave herself up for lost.
That she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might not appear, however, to observe or expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes intently fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fan; and a self-condemnation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
folly, in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with
the Tilneys in any reasonable time, had just passed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance,
by Mr. Tilney himself. With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
granted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) request, and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to the set, may be easily imagined. To escape, and, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believed, so narrowly escape John Thorpe, and to be asked, so
immediately on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) joining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), asked by Mr. Tilney, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had sought
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on purpose!--it did not appear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that life could supply any
greater felicity.

<p/>Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a
place, however, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attention was claimed by John Thorpe, who stood
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Heyday, Miss Morland!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``What is the meaning of
this? I thought you and I were to dance together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder you should think so, for you never asked me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a good one, by Jove! I asked you as soon as I came into the
room, and I was just going to ask you again, but when I turned round,
you were gone! This is a cursed shabby trick! I only came for the sake
of dancing with you, and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever
since Monday. Yes; I remember, I asked you while you were waiting in the
lobby for your cloak. And here have I been telling all my acquaintance
that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room; and
when they see you standing up with somebody else, they will quiz me
famously.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; they will never think of me, after such a description as that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By heavens, if they do not, I will kick them out of the room for
blockheads. What chap have you there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
curiosity. <div class="bookquote">``Tilney,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Hum--I do not know him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>). A good figure
of a man; well put together. Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) want a horse? Here is a friend
of mine, Sam Fletcher, has got one to sell that would suit anybody. A
famous clever animal for the road--only forty guineas. I had fifty minds
to buy it myself, for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse
when I meet with one; but it would not answer my purpose, it would not
do for the field. I would give any money for a real good hunter. I
have three now, the best that ever were backed. I would not take
eight hundred guineas for them. Fletcher and I mean to get a house in
Leicestershire, against the next season. It is so d--uncomfortable,
living at an inn.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the last sentence by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could weary Catherine's
attention, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of
a long string of passing ladies. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner now drew near, and said,
<div class="bookquote">``That gentleman would have put me out of patience, had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stayed with
you half a minute longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has no business to withdraw the attention
of my partner from me. We have entered into a contract of mutual
agreeableness for the space of an evening, and all our agreeableness
belongs solely to each other for that time. Nobody can fasten themselves
on the notice of one, without injuring the rights of the other.
I consider a country-dance as an emblem of marriage. Fidelity and
complaisance are the principal duties of both; and those men who do not
choose to dance or marry themselves, have no business with the partners
or wives of their neighbours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But they are such very different things!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``--That you think they cannot be compared together.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure not. People that marry can never part, but must go and keep
house together. People that dance only stand opposite each other in a
long room for half an hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing. Taken in that
light certainly, their resemblance is not striking; but I think I could
place them in such a view. You will allow, that in both, man has the
advantage of choice, woman only the power of refusal; that in both,
it is an engagement between man and woman, formed for the advantage of
each; and that when once entered into, they belong exclusively to each
other till the moment of its dissolution; that it is their duty, each
to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had
bestowed themselves elsewhere, and their best interest to keep their own
imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours,
or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else. You
will allow all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to be sure, as you state it, all this sounds very well; but still
they are so very different. I cannot look upon them at all in the same
light, nor think the same duties belong to them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In one respect, there certainly is a difference. In marriage, the man
is supposed to provide for the support of the woman, the woman to make
the home agreeable to the man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to purvey, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is to smile.
But in dancing, their duties are exactly changed; the agreeableness, the
compliance are expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) furnishes the fan and the
lavender water. That, I suppose, was the difference of duties which
struck you, as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I never thought of that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I am quite at a loss. One thing, however, I must observe. This
disposition on your side is rather alarming. You totally disallow any
similarity in the obligations; and may I not thence infer that your
notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your
partner might wish? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who
spoke to you just now were to return, or if any other gentleman were to
address you, there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with
him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as long as you chose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother's, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
talks to me, I must talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) again; but there are hardly three young
men in the room besides him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) that I have any acquaintance with.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And is that to be my only security? Alas, alas!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I am sure you cannot have a better; for if I do not know anybody,
it is impossible for me to talk to them; and, besides, I do not want to
talk to anybody.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now you have given me a security worth having; and I shall proceed
with courage. Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of
making the inquiry before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, quite--more so, indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``More so! Take care, or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper
time. You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think I should be tired, if I were to stay here six months.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bath, compared with London, has little variety, and so everybody finds
out every year. `For six weeks, I allow Bath is pleasant enough; but
beyond that, it is the most tiresome place in the world.' You would be
told so by people of all descriptions, who come regularly every winter,
lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve, and go away at last because
they can afford to stay no longer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, other people must judge for themselves, and those who go to
London may think nothing of Bath. But I, who live in a small retired
village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place
as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a
variety of things to be seen and done all day long, which I can know
nothing of there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not fond of the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am. I have always lived there, and always been very happy. But
certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath
life. One day in the country is exactly like another.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe there is much difference.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I am at home--only I do not find so much of it. I walk about
here, and so I do there; but here I see a variety of people in every
street, and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Tilney was very much amused.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only go and call on Mrs. Allen!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) repeated. <div class="bookquote">``What a picture of
intellectual poverty! However, when you sink into this abyss again, you
will have more to say. You will be able to talk of Bath, and of all that
you did here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Yes. I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs.
Allen, or anybody else. I really believe I shall always be talking of
Bath, when I am at home again--I do like it so very much. If I could but
have Papa and Mamma, and the rest of them here, I suppose I should be
too happy! James's coming -LRB-my eldest brother-RRB- is quite delightful--and
especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so
intimate with are his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) intimate friends already. Oh! Who can ever be
tired of Bath?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do.
But papas and mammas, and brothers, and intimate friends are a good deal
gone by, to most of the frequenters of Bath--and the honest relish of
balls and plays, and everyday sights, is past with them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here
their conversation closed, the demands of the dance becoming now too
importunate for a divided attention.

<p/>Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set, Catherine perceived
herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the
lookers-on, immediately behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a very handsome man,
of a commanding aspect, past the bloom, but not past the vigour of
life; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye still directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) presently
address Mr. Tilney in a familiar whisper. Confused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) notice, and
blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appearance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did so, the
gentleman retreated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner, coming nearer, said, <div class="bookquote">``I see that
you guess what I have just been asked. That gentleman knows your name,
and you have a right to know his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). It is General Tilney, my father.''

 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's answer was only <div class="bookquote">``Oh!'' (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>--but it was an <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>expressing
everything needful: attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) words, and perfect reliance on
their truth. With real interest and strong admiration did her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye now
follow the general, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) moved through the crowd, and <div class="bookquote">``How handsome a
family they are!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret remark.

<p/>In chatting with Miss Tilney before the evening concluded, a new source
of felicity arose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never taken a country walk since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) arrival in Bath. Miss Tilney, to whom all the commonly frequented
environs were familiar, spoke of them in terms which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) all
eagerness to know them too; and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) openly fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might
find nobody to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), it was proposed by the brother and sister
that they should join in a walk, some morning or other. <div class="bookquote">``I shall like
it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``beyond anything in the world; and do not let us put
it off--let us go tomorrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This was readily agreed to, with only a
proviso of Miss Tilney's, that it did not rain, which Catherine was sure
it would not. At twelve o’clock, they were to call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in Pulteney
Street; and <div class="bookquote">``Remember--twelve o’clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) parting speech to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) new friend. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) other, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) older, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) more established friend,
Isabella, of whose fidelity and worth she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had enjoyed a fortnight's
experience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) scarcely saw anything during the evening. Yet, though
longing to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) happiness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheerfully
submitted to the wish of Mr. Allen, which took them rather early away,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits danced within her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) danced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair all the
way home.




<p/>CHAPTER 11


<p/>The morrow brought a very sober-looking morning, the sun making only
a few efforts to appear, and Catherine augured from it everything most
favourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wishes. A bright morning so early in the year,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) allowed, would generally turn to rain, but a cloudy one foretold
improvement as the day advanced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) applied to Mr. Allen for
confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hopes, but Mr. Allen, not having his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own skies and
barometer about him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), declined giving any absolute promise of sunshine.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) applied to Mrs. Allen, and Mrs. Allen's opinion was more positive.
<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day, if the
clouds would only go off, and the sun keep out.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>At about eleven o’clock, however, a few specks of small rain upon the
windows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and <div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, I do believe it
will be wet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in a most desponding tone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought how it would be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Allen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No walk for me today,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>sighed Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``but perhaps it may come to
nothing, or it may hold up before twelve.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it may, but then, my dear, it will be so dirty.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! That will not signify; I never mind dirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend very placidly, <div class="bookquote">``I know you never mind dirt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``It comes on faster and faster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stood watching at a window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it does indeed. If it keeps raining, the streets will be very wet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There are four umbrellas up already. How I hate the sight of an
umbrella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They are disagreeable things to carry. I would much rather take a chair
at any time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was such a nice-looking morning! I felt so convinced it would be
dry!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anybody would have thought so indeed. There will be very few people in
the pump-room, if it rains all the morning. I hope Mr. Allen will put
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) greatcoat when he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) goes, but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) will not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had
rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat; I wonder
he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) should dislike it, it must be so comfortable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rain continued--fast, though not heavy. Catherine went every five
minutes to the clock, threatening on each return that, if it still
kept on raining another five minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would give up the matter as
hopeless. The clock struck twelve, and it still rained. <div class="bookquote">``You will not be
able to go, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not quite despair yet. I shall not give it up till a quarter after
twelve. This is just the time of day for it to clear up, and I do think
it looks a little lighter. There, it is twenty minutes after twelve, and
now I shall give it up entirely. Oh! That we had such weather here
as they had at Udolpho, or at least in Tuscany and the south of
France!--the night that poor St. Aubin died!--such beautiful weather!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>At half past twelve, when Catherine's anxious attention to the weather
was over and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could no longer claim any merit from its amendment, the
sky began voluntarily to clear. A gleam of sunshine took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quite by
surprise; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked round; the clouds were parting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) instantly
returned to the window to watch over and encourage the happy appearance.
Ten minutes more made it certain that a bright afternoon would succeed,
and justified the opinion of Mrs. Allen, who had <div class="bookquote">``always thought it
would clear up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>But whether Catherine might still expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends,
whether there had not been too much rain for Miss Tilney to venture,
must yet be a question.

<p/>It was too dirty for Mrs. Allen to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) husband to the
pump-room; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) accordingly set off by himself, and Catherine had barely
watched him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) down the street when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice was claimed by the approach
of the same two open carriages, containing the same three people that
had surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so much a few mornings back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Isabella, my brother, and Mr. Thorpe, I declare! They are coming for
me perhaps--but I shall not go--I cannot go indeed, for you know Miss
Tilney may still call.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Allen agreed to it. John Thorpe was soon
with them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) voice was with them yet sooner, for on the stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
was calling out to Miss Morland to be quick. <div class="bookquote">``Make haste! Make haste!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) threw open the door. <div class="bookquote">``Put on your hat this moment--there is no
time to be lost--we are going to Bristol. How d’ye do, Mrs. Allen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To Bristol! Is not that a great way off? But, however, I cannot go with
you today, because I am engaged; I expect some friends every moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was of course vehemently talked down as no reason at all; Mrs.
Allen was called on to second him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), and the two others walked in, to give
their assistance. <div class="bookquote">``My sweetest Catherine, is not this delightful? We
shall have a most heavenly drive. You are to thank your brother and me
for the scheme; it darted into our heads at breakfast-time, I verily
believe at the same instant; and we should have been off two hours ago
if it had not been for this detestable rain. But it does not signify,
the nights are moonlight, and we shall do delightfully. Oh! I am in such
ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet! So much
better than going to the Lower Rooms. We shall drive directly to Clifton
and dine there; and, as soon as dinner is over, if there is time for it,
go on to Kingsweston.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I doubt our being able to do so much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Morland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You croaking fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Thorpe. <div class="bookquote">``We shall be able to do ten times
more. Kingsweston! Aye, and Blaize Castle too, and anything else we can
hear of; but here is your sister says she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will not go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Blaize Castle!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The finest place in England--worth going fifty miles at any time to
see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, is it really a castle, an old castle?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The oldest in the kingdom.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But is it like what one reads of?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Exactly--the very same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now really--are there towers and long galleries?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By dozens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I should like to see it; but I cannot--I cannot go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not go! My beloved creature, what do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot go, because'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--looking down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke, fearful of Isabella's
smile--<div class="bookquote">``I expect Miss Tilney and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother to call on me to take a
country walk. They promised to come at twelve, only it rained; but now,
as it is so fine, I dare say they will be here soon.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not they indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Thorpe; <div class="bookquote">``for, as we turned into Broad Street, I
saw them--does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does; I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). You are talking of the man you danced
with last night, are not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road, driving a
smart-looking girl.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you indeed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did upon my soul; knew him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again directly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed to have got
some very pretty cattle too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very odd! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a
walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And well they might, for I never saw so much dirt in my life. Walk!
You could no more walk than you could fly! It has not been so dirty the
whole winter; it is ankle-deep everywhere.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella corroborated it: <div class="bookquote">``My dearest Catherine, you cannot form an idea
of the dirt; come, you must go; you cannot refuse going now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to see the castle; but may we go all over it? May we go
up every staircase, and into every suite of rooms?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, every hole and corner.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But then, if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer,
and call by and by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Make yourself easy, there is no danger of that, for I heard Tilney
hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback, that they were
going as far as Wick Rocks.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will. Shall I go, Mrs. Allen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as you please, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Allen, you must persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>was the general cry. Mrs.
Allen was not inattentive to it: <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``suppose you
go.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in two minutes they were off.

<p/>Catherine's feelings, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) got into the carriage, were in a very
unsettled state; divided between regret for the loss of one great
pleasure, and the hope of soon enjoying another, almost its equal in
degree, however unlike in kind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not think the Tilneys had
acted quite well by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), in so readily giving up their engagement,
without sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) any message of excuse. It was now but an hour later
than the time fixed on for the beginning of their walk; and, in spite of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had heard of the prodigious accumulation of dirt in the course
of that hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own observation help thinking that
they might have gone with very little inconvenience. To feel herself
slighted by them was very painful. On the other hand, the delight of
exploring an edifice like Udolpho, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fancy represented Blaize
Castle to be, was such a counterpoise of good as might console her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for
almost anything.

<p/>They passed briskly down Pulteney Street, and through Laura Place,
without the exchange of many words. Thorpe talked to his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) horse, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
meditated, by turns, on broken promises and broken arches, phaetons
and false hangings, Tilneys and trap-doors. As they entered Argyle
Buildings, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was roused by this address from her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) companion,
<div class="bookquote">``Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went by?''

 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Where?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the right-hand pavement--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be almost out of sight now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine looked round and saw Miss Tilney leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother's arm,
walking slowly down the street. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw them both looking back at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">``Stop, stop, Mr. Thorpe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) impatiently cried; <div class="bookquote">``it is Miss Tilney; it
is indeed. How could you tell me they were gone? Stop, stop, I will
get out this moment and go to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But to what purpose did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) speak?
Thorpe only lashed his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) horse into a brisker trot; the Tilneys, who had
soon ceased to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), were in a moment out of sight round the
corner of Laura Place, and in another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) was herself whisked
into the marketplace. Still, however, and during the length of another
street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Place</b></font>) entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to stop. <div class="bookquote">``Pray, pray stop, Mr. Thorpe. I
cannot go on. I will not go on. I must go back to Miss Tilney.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Thorpe</b></font>)</div>But Mr.
Thorpe only laughed, smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) whip, encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) horse, made odd
noises, and drove on; and Catherine, angry and vexed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was, having
no power of getting away, was obliged to give up the point and submit.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reproaches, however, were not spared. <div class="bookquote">``How could you deceive me so,
Mr. Thorpe? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown
Road? I would not have had it happen so for the world. They must think
it so strange, so rude of me! To go by them, too, without saying a word!
You do not know how vexed I am; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton, nor
in anything else. I had rather, ten thousand times rather, get out now,
and walk back to them. How could you say you saw them driving out in a
phaeton?''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>Thorpe defended himself very stoutly, declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had never
seen two men so much alike in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) life, and would hardly give up the
point of its having been Tilney himself.

<p/>Their drive, even when this subject was over, was not likely to be very
agreeable. Catherine's complaisance was no longer what it had been in
their former airing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) listened reluctantly, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replies were
short. Blaize Castle remained her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only comfort; towards that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still
looked at intervals with pleasure; though rather than be disappointed of
the promised walk, and especially rather than be thought ill of by the
Tilneys, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would willingly have given up all the happiness which its
walls could supply--the happiness of a progress through a long suite of
lofty rooms, exhibiting the remains of magnificent furniture, though
now for many years deserted--the happiness of being stopped in their way
along narrow, winding vaults, by a low, grated door; or even of having
their lamp, their only lamp, extinguished by a sudden gust of wind, and
of being left in total darkness. In the meanwhile, they proceeded on
their journey without any mischance, and were within view of the town
of Keynsham, when a halloo from Morland, who was behind them, made his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)
friend pull up, to know what was the matter. The others then came close
enough for conversation, and Morland said, <div class="bookquote">``We had better go back,
Thorpe; it is too late to go on today; your sister thinks so as well as
I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street, very little
more than seven miles; and, I suppose, we have at least eight more to
go. It will never do. We set out a great deal too late. We had much
better put it off till another day, and turn round.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is all one to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>replied Thorpe rather angrily; and instantly
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) horse, they were on their way back to Bath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``If your brother had not got such a d--beast to drive,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) soon
afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``we might have done it very well. My horse would have
trotted to Clifton within the hour, if left to himself, and I have
almost broke my arm with pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Clifton</b></font>) in to that cursed broken-winded
jade's pace. Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine warmly, <div class="bookquote">``for I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) could not
afford it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And why cannot he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) afford it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has not money enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And whose fault is that?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody's, that I know of.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>Thorpe then said something in the loud,
incoherent way to which he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had often recourse, about its being a
d--thing to be miserly; and that if people who rolled in money could not
afford things, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) did not know who could, which Catherine did not even
endeavour to understand. Disappointed of what was to have been the
consolation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first disappointment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was less and less disposed
either to be agreeable herself or to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion so; and they
returned to Pulteney Street without her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) speaking twenty words.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the house, the footman told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that a gentleman and lady
had called and inquired for her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a few minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) setting off;
that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) told them she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was gone out with Mr. Thorpe, the lady had
asked whether any message had been left for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) saying no,
had felt for a card, but said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had none about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and went away.
Pondering over these heart-rending tidings, Catherine walked slowly
upstairs. At the head of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was met by Mr. Allen, who, on hearing
the reason of their speedy return, said, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad your brother had so
much sense; I am glad you are come back. It was a strange, wild scheme.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>They all spent the evening together at Thorpe's. Catherine was disturbed
and out of spirits; but Isabella seemed to find a pool of commerce, in
the fate of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) shared, by private partnership with Morland, a
very good equivalent for the quiet and country air of an inn at Clifton.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) satisfaction, too, in not being at the Lower Rooms was spoken more
than once. <div class="bookquote">``How I pity the poor creatures that are going there! How glad
I am that I am not amongst them! I wonder whether it will be a full ball
or not! They have not begun dancing yet. I would not be there for
all the world. It is so delightful to have an evening now and then
to oneself. I dare say it will not be a very good ball. I know the
Mitchells will not be there. I am sure I pity everybody that is. But I
dare say, Mr. Morland, you long to be at it, do not you? I am sure you
do. Well, pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you. I dare say
we could do very well without you; but you men think yourselves of such
consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine could almost have accused Isabella of being wanting in
tenderness towards herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sorrows, so very little did they
appear to dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind, and so very inadequate was the comfort she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
offered. <div class="bookquote">``Do not be so dull, my dearest creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">``You
will quite break my heart. It was amazingly shocking, to be sure; but
the Tilneys were entirely to blame. Why were not they more punctual?
It was dirty, indeed, but what did that signify? I am sure John and I
should not have minded it. I never mind going through anything, where a
friend is concerned; that is my disposition, and John is just the same;
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has amazing strong feelings. Good heavens! What a delightful hand you
have got! Kings, I vow! I never was so happy in my life! I would fifty
times rather you should have them than myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And now I may dismiss my heroine to the sleepless couch, which is the
true heroine's portion; to a pillow strewed with thorns and wet with
tears. And lucky may she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) think herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) get another good night's
rest in the course of the next three months.




<p/>CHAPTER 12


<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Allen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine the next morning, <div class="bookquote">``will there be any harm
in my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I have
explained everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney always
wears white.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more
impatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might inform
herself of General Tilney's lodgings, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believed they were
in Milsom Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen's
wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened
away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) visit, explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and
resolutely turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) eyes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) might not be obliged to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) beloved Isabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) dear family, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had reason to
believe, were in a shop hard by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) reached the house without any
impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for
Miss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not
quite certain. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be pleased to send up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) name? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
card. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did
not quite confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words, said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been mistaken, for that Miss
Tilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left
the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney was at home, and
too much offended to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) retired down the street,
could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in
expectation of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) there, but no one appeared at them. At the
bottom of the street, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked back again, and then, not at a
window, but issuing from the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) saw Miss Tilney herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was
followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father,
and they turned up towards Edgar's Buildings. Catherine, in deep
mortification, proceeded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could almost be angry herself
at such angry incivility; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) checked the resentful sensation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own ignorance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not how such an offence as hers
might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree
of unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of
rudeness in return it might justly make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) amenable.

<p/>Dejected and humbled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had even some thoughts of not going with the
others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they
were not of long continuance, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) soon recollected, in the first
place, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the
second, that it was a play she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wanted very much to see. To the theatre
accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>);
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness
for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were
habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
knew, on Isabella's authority, rendered everything else of the kind
<div class="bookquote">``quite horrid.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own expectation of pleasure;
the comedy so well suspended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) care that no one, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) during
the first four acts, would have supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had any wretchedness about
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). On the beginning of the fifth, however, the sudden view of Mr.
Henry Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father, joining a party in the opposite box,
recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to anxiety and distress. The stage could no longer excite
genuine merriment--no longer keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole attention. Every other look
upon an average was directed towards the opposite box; and, for the
space of two entire scenes, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thus watch Henry Tilney, without
being once able to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eye. No longer could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be suspected of
indifference for a play; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) notice was never withdrawn from the stage
during two whole scenes. At length, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) did look towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) bowed--but such a bow! No smile, no continued observance attended
it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes were immediately returned to their former direction.
Catherine was restlessly miserable; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could almost have run round to
the box in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sat and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) explanation. Feelings
rather natural than heroic possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); instead of considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own dignity injured by this ready condemnation--instead of proudly
resolving, in conscious innocence, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resentment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
who could harbour a doubt of it, to leave to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) all the trouble
of seeking an explanation, and to enlighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) on the past only by
avoiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sight, or flirting with somebody else--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took to herself
all the shame of misconduct, or at least of its appearance, and was only
eager for an opportunity of explaining its cause.

<p/>The play concluded--the curtain fell--Henry Tilney was no longer to be
seen where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had hitherto sat, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father remained, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
might be now coming round to their box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was right; in a few minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) appeared, and, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) way through the then thinning rows, spoke
with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend. Not with such
calmness was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered by the latter: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been
quite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have thought
me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs. Allen?
Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister were gone out in a
phaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten thousand times
rather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear, you tumble my gown,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Allen's reply.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away; it
brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) countenance, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve:
<div class="bookquote">``We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk
after our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look back
on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such
a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not--Oh! You were
not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped,
I would have jumped out and run after you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a
declaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
said everything that need be said of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister's concern, regret, and
dependence on Catherine's honour. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was not
angry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``because I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would not see
me this morning when I called; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) walk out of the house the next
minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted. Perhaps
you did not know I had been there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such
incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more than
that my father--they were just preparing to walk out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being
hurried for time, and not caring to have it put off--made a point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
being denied. That was all, I do assure you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was very much vexed,
and meant to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) apology as soon as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something
of solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question,
thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the
gentleman: <div class="bookquote">``But, Mr. Tilney, why were you less generous than your
sister? If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could
suppose it to be only a mistake, why should you be so ready to take
offence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! I take offence!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were
angry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I angry! I could have no right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
replied by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to make room for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and talking of the play.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for
Catherine to be contented when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) went away. Before they parted,
however, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon
as possible; and, setting aside the misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quitting their box,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the
world.

<p/>While talking to each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had observed with some surprise that
John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten minutes
together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt
something more than surprise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could perceive herself
the object of their attention and discourse. What could they have to say
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feared General Tilney did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appearance: she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found
it was implied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admittance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter, rather
than postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own walk a few minutes. <div class="bookquote">``How came Mr. Thorpe to know
your father?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anxious inquiry, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pointed them out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knew nothing about it; but his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) father, like every military
man, had a very large acquaintance.

<p/>When the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in getting
out. Catherine was the immediate object of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) gallantry; and, while
they waited in the lobby for a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) prevented the inquiry which had
travelled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart almost to the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tongue, by asking, in
a consequential manner, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) talking with General
Tilney: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout, active--looks
as young as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stout</b></font>) son. I have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stout</b></font>), I assure you: a
gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how came you to know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! There are few people much about town that I do not know. I
have met him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) forever at the Bedford; and I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face again today the
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came into the billiard-room. One of the best players we have,
by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was almost
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at first: the odds were five to four against me; and, if
I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in
this world--I took his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ball exactly--but I could not make you understand
it without a table; however, I did beat him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). A very fine fellow; as rich
as a Jew. I should like to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) gives famous
dinners. But what do you think we have been talking of? You. Yes, by
heavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And what do you think I said?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) voice--<div class="bookquote">``well done,
general, said I; I am quite of your mind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Catherine, who was much less gratified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) admiration than by
General Tilney's, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen. Thorpe,
however, would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) chair, and, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) entered it, continued
the same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to
have done.

<p/>That General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), was very
delightful; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) joyfully thought that there was not one of the
family whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) need now fear to meet. The evening had done more, much
more, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) than could have been expected.




<p/>CHAPTER 13


<p/>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now
passed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes
and fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,
and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the
week. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on
the afternoon's Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In a
private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom had
particularly set her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart upon going, and the latter no less anxiously
placed his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) upon pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), it was agreed that, provided the weather
were fair, the party should take place on the following morning; and
they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in good time.
The affair thus determined, and Thorpe's approbation secured, Catherine
only remained to be apprised of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had left them for a few minutes
to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the plan was completed, and as
soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) came again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) agreement was demanded; but instead of the
gay acquiescence expected by Isabella, Catherine looked grave, was very
sorry, but could not go. The engagement which ought to have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
accompany them now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take
their proposed walk tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would
not, upon any account, retract. But that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must and should retract
was instantly the eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton
tomorrow, they would not go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), it would be nothing to put off
a mere walk for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal.
Catherine was distressed, but not subdued. <div class="bookquote">``Do not urge me, Isabella. I
am engaged to Miss Tilney. I cannot go.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This availed nothing. The same
arguments assailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) must go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should go, and they would
not hear of a refusal. <div class="bookquote">``It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you
had just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put
off the walk till Tuesday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior
engagement.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in the most affectionate manner, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) by the most
endearing names. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dearest, sweetest Catherine would not
seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so
dearly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so
sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loved. But all
in vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained
by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to
influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Isabella then tried another method. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) so
little a while, than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) best and oldest friends, with being grown
cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. <div class="bookquote">``I cannot help being
jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who
love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not
in the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are
stronger than anybody's; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace;
and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me
to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it the
part of a friend thus to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings to the notice of others?
Isabella appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) ungenerous and selfish, regardless of
everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,
could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out any
longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a friend--I
shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>This was the first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) brother's openly siding against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), and
anxious to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) displeasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) proposed a compromise. If they
would only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily
do, as it depended only on themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could go with them, and
everybody might then be satisfied. But <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the immediate
answer; <div class="bookquote">``that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might not
go to town on Tuesday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and
a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of
cold resentment said, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, then there is an end of the party.
If Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would
not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Catherine, you must go,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div>said James.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) other sisters? I dare say
either of them would like to go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Thorpe, <div class="bookquote">``but I did not come to Bath to drive my
sisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d-- me if I
do. I only go for the sake of driving you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) words were
lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.

<p/>The three others still continued together, walking in a most
uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,
sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm was still linked within Isabella's, though their hearts were
at war. At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was softened, at another irritated; always
distressed, but always steady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div>said James;
<div class="bookquote">``you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the kindest,
best-tempered of my sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>James/James Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am not less so now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) replied, very feelingly; <div class="bookquote">``but indeed
I cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suspect,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``there is no great
struggle.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's heart swelled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm, and Isabella made no
opposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined
by Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I
have settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe
conscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have, upon my soul. Left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) this moment. Told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) you had sent me to
say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton
with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
till Tuesday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) said very well, Tuesday was just as convenient to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>);
so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty good thought of
mine--hey?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella's countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and
James too looked happy again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our
distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a
most delightful party.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This will not do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot submit to this. I must run
after Miss Tilney directly and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) right.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and
remonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry. When
everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday would
suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make any
further objection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.
If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss
Tilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know
that Mr. Thorpe has--He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) may be mistaken again perhaps; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) led me into
one act of rudeness by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;
Isabella, do not hold me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Thorpe told her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were
turning the corner into Brock Street, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) had overtaken them, and
were at home by this time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I will go after them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``wherever they are I will
go after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded
into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>And with these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have
darted after her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), but Morland withheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) go, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) go, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is as obstinate as--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a proper
one.

<p/>Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would
permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resistance. Setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own inclination
apart, to have failed a second time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) engagement to Miss Tilney, to
have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,
and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not been
withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not consulted
merely her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own gratification; that might have been ensured in some
degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had
attended to what was due to others, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own character in their
opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) conviction of being right, however, was not enough to
restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) composure; till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had spoken to Miss Tilney she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could not
be at ease; and quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pace when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) got clear of the Crescent,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) almost ran over the remaining ground till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) gained the top of
Milsom Street. So rapid had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) movements that in spite of the
Tilneys' advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into
their lodgings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) came within view of them; and the servant still
remaining at the open door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) used only the ceremony of saying
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
proceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), which
happened to be the right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) immediately found herself in the
drawing-room with General Tilney, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) son, and daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
explanation, defective only in being--from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) irritation of nerves and
shortness of breath--no explanation at all, was instantly given. <div class="bookquote">``I am
come in a great hurry--It was all a mistake--I never promised to go--I
told them from the first I could not go.--I ran away in a great hurry
to explain it.--I did not care what you thought of me.--I would not stay
for the servant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,
soon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe had given
the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly
surprised by it. But whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother had still exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) in
resentment, Catherine, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) instinctively addressed herself as
much to one as to the other in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) vindication, had no means of knowing.
Whatever might have been felt before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) arrival, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eager declarations
immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could
desire.

<p/>The affair thus happily settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was introduced by Miss Tilney
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father, and received by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with such ready, such solicitous
politeness as recalled Thorpe's information to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mind, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
think with pleasure that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be sometimes depended on. To such
anxious attention was the general's civility carried, that not aware of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was quite angry
with the servant whose neglect had reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to open the door of the
apartment herself. <div class="bookquote">``What did William mean by it? He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should make a point
of inquiring into the matter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>And if Catherine had not most warmly
asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the
favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master forever, if not his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) place, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rapidity.

<p/>After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rose to take leave,
and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney's asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest
of the day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Miss Tilney added her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own wishes. Catherine was
greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen
would expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) back every moment. The general declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could say no
more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded; but on
some other day he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) trusted, when longer notice could be given, they would
not refuse to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no; Catherine was sure they
would not have the least objection, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have great pleasure
in coming.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The general attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) himself to the street-door, saying
everything gallant as they went downstairs, admiring the elasticity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) walk, which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) dancing, and
making her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) one of the most graceful bows she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had ever beheld, when they
parted.

<p/>Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to Pulteney
Street, walking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) concluded, with great elasticity, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had never thought of it before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reached home without seeing anything
more of the offended party; and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been triumphant
throughout, had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) point, and was secure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began
-LRB-as the flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits subsided-RRB- to doubt whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been
perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had given way
to their entreaties, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have been spared the distressing idea of
a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a scheme of great happiness
to both destroyed, perhaps through her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) means. To ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind, and
ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own conduct
had really been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took occasion to mention before Mr. Allen the
half-settled scheme of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother and the Thorpes for the following
day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and do you think
of going too?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told
me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could I?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes
are not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country
in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and
public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should
allow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs. Morland
would not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of thinking? Do
not you think these kind of projects objectionable?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean
gown is not five minutes' wear in them. You are splashed getting in
and getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every
direction. I hate an open carriage myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has an
odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by
young men, to whom they are not even related?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``then why did not you tell me so before?
I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with
Mr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought
I was doing wrong.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs.
Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But
one must not be over particular. Young people will be young people,
as your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first
came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do
not like to be always thwarted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you
would have found me hard to persuade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Allen;
<div class="bookquote">``and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any
more.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just what I was going to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>added his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Catherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a
moment's thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper
and kind in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) must be as insensible as herself; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) considered that
Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in
spite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from doing
any such thing. <div class="bookquote">``You had better leave her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) alone, my dear; she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is old
enough to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) is about, and if not, has a mother to advise
her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>). Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however, you had
better not interfere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) and your brother choose to go, and you will be
only getting ill will.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be
doing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen's approbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
own conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) advice from the
danger of falling into such an error herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) escape from being one
of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the
Tilneys have thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) promise to them in
order to do what was wrong in itself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been guilty of one
breach of propriety, only to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to be guilty of another?




<p/>CHAPTER 14


<p/>The next morning was fair, and Catherine almost expected another attack
from the assembled party. With Mr. Allen to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt no
dread of the event: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would gladly be spared a contest, where
victory itself was painful, and was heartily rejoiced therefore at
neither seeing nor hearing anything of them. The Tilneys called for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) at the appointed time; and no new difficulty arising, no sudden
recollection, no unexpected summons, no impertinent intrusion to
disconcert their measures, my heroine was most unnaturally able to
fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) engagement, though it was made with the hero himself.
They determined on walking round Beechen Cliff, that noble hill whose
beautiful verdure and hanging coppice render it so striking an object
from almost every opening in Bath.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never look at it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, as they walked along the side of
the river, <div class="bookquote">``without thinking of the south of France.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You have been abroad then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, a little surprised.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! No, I only mean what I have read about. It always puts me in mind
of the country that Emily and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) father travelled through, in The
Mysteries of Udolpho. But you never read novels, I dare say?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because they are not clever enough for you--gentlemen read better
books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good
novel, must be intolerably stupid. I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe's
works, and most of them with great pleasure. The Mysteries of Udolpho,
when I had once begun it, I could not lay down again; I remember
finishing it in two days--my hair standing on end the whole time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>added Miss Tilney, <div class="bookquote">``and I remember that you undertook to read it
aloud to me, and that when I was called away for only five minutes to
answer a note, instead of waiting for me, you took the volume into the
Hermitage Walk, and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Eleanor--a most honourable testimony. You see, Miss Morland,
the injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on,
refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise
I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in suspense at a most
interesting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are to
observe, was her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own, particularly her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own. I am proud when I reflect on
it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad to hear it indeed, and now I shall never be ashamed of
liking Udolpho myself. But I really thought before, young men despised
novels amazingly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is amazingly; it may well suggest amazement if they do--for they
read nearly as many as women. I myself have read hundreds and hundreds.
Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and
Louisas. If we proceed to particulars, and engage in the never-ceasing
inquiry of `Have you read this?' and `Have you read that?' I shall soon
leave you as far behind me as--what shall I say?--I want an appropriate
simile.--as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) aunt into Italy. Consider how many years I have had
the start of you. I had entered on my studies at Oxford, while you were
a good little girl working your sampler at home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not very good, I am afraid. But now really, do not you think Udolpho
the nicest book in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The nicest--by which I suppose you mean the neatest. That must depend
upon the binding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, <div class="bookquote">``you are very impertinent. Miss Morland, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
is treating you exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is forever finding
fault with me, for some incorrectness of language, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is taking
the same liberty with you. The word `nicest,' as you used it, did not
suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall
be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``I did not mean to say anything wrong; but
it is a nice book, and why should not I call it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, <div class="bookquote">``and this is a very nice day, and we are taking
a very nice walk, and you are two very nice young ladies. Oh! It is a
very nice word indeed! It does for everything. Originally perhaps it
was applied only to express neatness, propriety, delicacy, or
refinement--people were nice in their dress, in their sentiments, or
their choice. But now every commendation on every subject is comprised
in that one word.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``While, in fact,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">``it ought only to be applied to you,
without any commendation at all. You are more nice than wise. Come,
Miss Morland, let us leave him (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) to meditate over our faults in the utmost
propriety of diction, while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we
like best. It is a most interesting work. You are fond of that kind of
reading?''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To say the truth, I do not much like any other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, I can read poetry and plays, and things of that sort, and
do not dislike travels. But history, real solemn history, I cannot be
interested in. Can you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am fond of history.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I were too. I read it a little as a duty, but it tells me
nothing that does not either vex or weary me. The quarrels of popes and
kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all so good for
nothing, and hardly any women at all--it is very tiresome: and yet I
often think it odd that it should be so dull, for a great deal of it
must be invention. The speeches that are put into the heroes' mouths,
their thoughts and designs--the chief of all this must be invention, and
invention is what delights me in other books.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Historians, you think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, <div class="bookquote">``are not happy in their
flights of fancy. They display imagination without raising interest. I
am fond of history--and am very well contented to take the false with
the true. In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence
in former histories and records, which may be as much depended on,
I conclude, as anything that does not actually pass under one's own
observation; and as for the little embellishments you speak of, they are
embellishments, and I like them as such. If a speech be well drawn up,
I read it with pleasure, by whomsoever it may be made--and probably with
much greater, if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson, than if
the genuine words of Caractacus, Agricola, or Alfred the Great.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are fond of history! And so are Mr. Allen and my father; and I have
two brothers who do not dislike it. So many instances within my small
circle of friends is remarkable! At this rate, I shall not pity the
writers of history any longer. If people like to read their books, it
is all very well, but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes,
which, as I used to think, nobody would willingly ever look into, to be
labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls, always struck
me as a hard fate; and though I know it is all very right and necessary,
I have often wondered at the person's courage that could sit down on
purpose to do it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That little boys and girls should be tormented,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, <div class="bookquote">``is what
no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can
deny; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians, I must observe
that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher
aim, and that by their method and style, they are perfectly well
qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature
time of life. I use the verb `to torment,' as I observed to be your own
method, instead of `to instruct,' supposing them to be now admitted as
synonymous.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think me foolish to call instruction a torment, but if you had been
as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their
letters and then learning to spell, if you had ever seen how stupid they
can be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother is
at the end of it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my
life at home, you would allow that `to torment' and `to instruct' might
sometimes be used as synonymous words.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very probably. But historians are not accountable for the difficulty
of learning to read; and even you yourself, who do not altogether seem
particularly friendly to very severe, very intense application, may
perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth-while to
be tormented for two or three years of one's life, for the sake of
being able to read all the rest of it. Consider--if reading had not been
taught, Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain--or perhaps might not
have written at all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine assented--and a very warm panegyric from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on that lady's
merits closed the subject. The Tilneys were soon engaged in another on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had nothing to say. They were viewing the country with the
eyes of persons accustomed to drawing, and decided on its capability of
being formed into pictures, with all the eagerness of real taste. Here
Catherine was quite lost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew nothing of drawing--nothing of taste:
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) listened to them with an attention which brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) little
profit, for they talked in phrases which conveyed scarcely any idea
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The little which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could understand, however, appeared to
contradict the very few notions she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had entertained on the matter
before. It seemed as if a good view were no longer to be taken from the
top of an high hill, and that a clear blue sky was no longer a proof
of a fine day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was heartily ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ignorance. A misplaced
shame. Where people wish to attach, they should always be ignorant.
To come with a well-informed mind is to come with an inability of
administering to the vanity of others, which a sensible person would
always wish to avoid. A woman especially, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) have the misfortune of
knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) can.

<p/>The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful girl have been already
set forth by the capital pen of a sister author; and to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) treatment
of the subject I will only add, in justice to men, that though to the
larger and more trifling part of the sex, imbecility in females is a
great enhancement of their personal charms, there is a portion of them
too reasonable and too well informed themselves to desire anything
more in woman than ignorance. But Catherine did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
advantages--did not know that a good-looking girl, with an affectionate
heart and a very ignorant mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young
man, unless circumstances are particularly untoward. In the present
instance, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) confessed and lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) want of knowledge, declared
that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would give anything in the world to be able to draw; and
a lecture on the picturesque immediately followed, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
instructions were so clear that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soon began to see beauty in
everything admired by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attention was so earnest that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
became perfectly satisfied of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having a great deal of natural taste.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked of foregrounds, distances, and second distances--side-screens
and perspectives--lights and shades; and Catherine was so hopeful a
scholar that when they gained the top of Beechen Cliff, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voluntarily
rejected the whole city of Bath as unworthy to make part of a landscape.
Delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) progress, and fearful of wearying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with too much
wisdom at once, Henry suffered the subject to decline, and by an easy
transition from a piece of rocky fragment and the withered oak which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had placed near its summit, to oaks in general, to forests, the
enclosure of them, waste lands, crown lands and government, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shortly
found himself arrived at politics; and from politics, it was an
easy step to silence. The general pause which succeeded his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) short
disquisition on the state of the nation was put an end to by Catherine,
who, in rather a solemn tone of voice, uttered these words, <div class="bookquote">``I have
heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Tilney, to whom this was chiefly addressed, was startled, and
hastily replied, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed! And of what nature?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I do not know, nor who is the author. I have only heard that it is
to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good heaven! Where could you hear of such a thing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from
London yesterday. It is to be uncommonly dreadful. I shall expect murder
and everything of the kind.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak with astonishing composure! But I hope your friend's accounts
have been exaggerated; and if such a design is known beforehand, proper
measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming
to effect.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Government,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, endeavouring not to smile, <div class="bookquote">``neither desires
nor dares to interfere in such matters. There must be murder; and
government cares not how much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>The ladies stared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) laughed, and added, <div class="bookquote">``Come, shall I make you
understand each other, or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as
you can? No--I will be noble. I will prove myself a man, no less by the
generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head. I have no patience
with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the
comprehension of yours. Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound
nor acute--neither vigorous nor keen. Perhaps they may want observation,
discernment, judgment, fire, genius, and wit.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Morland, do not mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) says; but have the goodness to
satisfy me as to this dreadful riot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Riot! What riot?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain. The confusion
there is scandalous. Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more
dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three
duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with
a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern--do you
understand? And you, Miss Morland--my stupid sister has mistaken all
your clearest expressions. You talked of expected horrors in London--and
instead of instantly conceiving, as any rational creature would have
done, that such words could relate only to a circulating library, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling
in St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the
streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light
Dragoons -LRB-the hopes of the nation-RRB- called up from Northampton to quell
the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the
moment of charging at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) troop, knocked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) horse by a
brickbat from an upper window. Forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) stupidity. The fears of the
sister have added to the weakness of the woman; but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is by no means a
simpleton in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine looked grave. <div class="bookquote">``And now, Henry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, <div class="bookquote">``that you
have made us understand each other, you may as well make Miss Morland
understand yourself--unless you mean to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) think you intolerably
rude to your sister, and a great brute in your opinion of women in
general. Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be most happy to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) better acquainted with them.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt; but that is no explanation of the present.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what you ought to do. Clear your character handsomely before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>). Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) that you think very highly of the understanding of women.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Morland, I think very highly of the understanding of all the women
in the world--especially of those--whoever they may be--with whom I
happen to be in company.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not enough. Be more serious.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Morland, no one can think more highly of the understanding of
women than I do. In my opinion, nature has given them so much that they
never find it necessary to use more than half.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall get nothing more serious from him (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) now, Miss Morland. He (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) is
not in a sober mood. But I do assure you that he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) must be entirely
misunderstood, if he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman
at all, or an unkind one of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>It was no effort to Catherine to believe that Henry Tilney could never
be wrong. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) manner might sometimes surprise, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) meaning must
always be just: and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was almost as ready
to admire, as what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did. The whole walk was delightful, and though it
ended too soon, its conclusion was delightful too; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends attended
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into the house, and Miss Tilney, before they parted, addressing
herself with respectful form, as much to Mrs. Allen as to Catherine,
petitioned for the pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) company to dinner on the day after
the next. No difficulty was made on Mrs. Allen's side, and the only
difficulty on Catherine's was in concealing the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/>The morning had passed away so charmingly as to banish all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
friendship and natural affection, for no thought of Isabella or James
had crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) during their walk. When the Tilneys were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
became amiable again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was amiable for some time to little
effect; Mrs. Allen had no intelligence to give that could relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
anxiety; she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had heard nothing of any of them. Towards the end of the
morning, however, Catherine, having occasion for some indispensable yard
of ribbon which must be bought without a moment's delay, walked out into
the town, and in Bond Street overtook the second Miss Thorpe as she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was
loitering towards Edgar's Buildings between two of the sweetest girls in
the world, who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) dear friends all the morning. From her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
soon learned that the party to Clifton had taken place. <div class="bookquote">``They set off at
eight this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Anne</b></font>)</div>said Miss Anne, <div class="bookquote">``and I am sure I do not envy
them their drive. I think you and I are very well off to be out of the
scrape. It must be the dullest thing in the world, for there is not a
soul at Clifton at this time of year. Belle went with your brother, and
John drove Maria.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Anne</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine spoke the pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) really felt on hearing this part of the
arrangement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rejoined the other, <div class="bookquote">``Maria is gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was quite wild to go.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought it would be something very fine. I cannot say I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
taste; and for my part, I was determined from the first not to go, if
they pressed me ever so much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, a little doubtful of this, could not help answering, <div class="bookquote">``I wish
you could have gone too. It is a pity you could not all go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me. Indeed, I
would not have gone on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophia
when you overtook us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was still unconvinced; but glad that Anne should have the
friendship of an Emily and a Sophia to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) adieu
without much uneasiness, and returned home, pleased that the party had
not been prevented by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) refusing to join it, and very heartily wishing
that it might be too pleasant to allow either James or Isabella to
resent her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) resistance any longer.




<p/>CHAPTER 15


<p/>Early the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness
in every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend on
a matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest
state of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar's Buildings. The two
youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne's
quitting it to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister, Catherine took the opportunity of asking
the other for some particulars of their yesterday's party. Maria desired
no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine immediately
learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the
world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had been, and that
it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive. Such was the
information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded thus much in
detail--that they had driven directly to the York Hotel, ate some soup,
and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the pump-room, tasted the
water, and laid out some shillings in purses and spars; thence adjourned
to eat ice at a pastry-cook's, and hurrying back to the hotel, swallowed
their dinner in haste, to prevent being in the dark; and then had a
delightful drive back, only the moon was not up, and it rained a little,
and Mr. Morland's horse was so tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could hardly get it along.

<p/>Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that Blaize
Castle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was
nothing to regret for half an instant. Maria's intelligence concluded
with a tender effusion of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister Anne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) represented
as insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help
it? John would have me go, for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>), because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) had such thick ankles. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) will not be in good humour
again this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a
little matter that puts me out of temper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such
happy importance, as engaged all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend's notice. Maria was without
ceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began: <div class="bookquote">``Yes,
my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not deceived
you. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``compose
yourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and
talk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my note?
Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my heart, can
judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most charming of
men. I only wish I were more worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But what will your excellent
father and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them I am so
agitated!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly
darted into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried out, <div class="bookquote">``Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can
you--can you really be in love with James?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This bold surmise, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) soon learnt comprehended but half the
fact. The anxious affection, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was accused of having continually
watched in Isabella's every look and action, had, in the course of their
yesterday's party, received the delightful confession of an equal love.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart and faith were alike engaged to James. Never had Catherine
listened to anything so full of interest, wonder, and joy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend engaged! New to such circumstances, the importance of
it appeared unspeakably great, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) contemplated it as one of those
grand events, of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a
return. The strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not express; the nature
of them, however, contented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend. The happiness of having such a
sister was their first effusion, and the fair ladies mingled in embraces
and tears of joy.

<p/>Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the
connection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
in tender anticipations. <div class="bookquote">``You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my
Catherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much
more attached to my dear Morland's family than to my own.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so like your dear brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>continued Isabella, <div class="bookquote">``that I quite
doted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me;
the first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland
came to us last Christmas--the very first moment I beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)--my heart
was irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair
done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John
introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though
exceedingly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother, and partial to all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) endowments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life thought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) handsome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) puce-coloured sarsenet; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) looked so heavenly that I thought
your brother must certainly fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>); I could not sleep
a wink all right for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless
nights I have had on your brother's account! I would not have you suffer
half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I will
not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it. I
feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually--so unguarded in speaking
of my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would
be safe with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an
ignorance little expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared no longer contest the point,
nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate
sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) found,
was preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
situation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation
to the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was herself persuaded, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father and mother would never oppose
their son's wishes. <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for parents to be
more kind, or more desirous of their children's happiness; I have no
doubt of their consenting immediately.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Morland says exactly the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>replied Isabella; <div class="bookquote">``and yet I dare not
expect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it.
Your brother, who might marry anybody!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Catherine again discerned the force of love.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be
nothing to signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! My sweet Catherine, in your generous heart I know it would signify
nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many. As for
myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had I the
command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your brother
would be my only choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty,
gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
acquaintance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend never looked more lovely than
in uttering the grand idea. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure they will consent,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
frequent declaration; <div class="bookquote">``I am sure they will be delighted with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For my own part,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, <div class="bookquote">``my wishes are so moderate that the
smallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are
really attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would
not settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired village
would be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about Richmond.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Richmond!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``You must settle near Fullerton. You must
be near us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near you,
I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow myself
to think of such things, till we have your father's answer. Morland
says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter. I know
it will be the death of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>A reverie succeeded this conviction--and when Isabella spoke again, it
was to resolve on the quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wedding-gown.

<p/>Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself,
who came to breathe his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) parting sigh before he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) set off for Wiltshire.
Catherine wished to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), but knew not what to say, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eloquence was only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes. From them, however, the eight parts of
speech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with
ease. Impatient for the realization of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hoped at home, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
adieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) not
been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fair one that
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would go. Twice was he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) called almost from the door by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eagerness
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) gone. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how
far you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven's
sake, waste no more time. There, go, go--I insist on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were inseparable
for the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours flew along.
Mrs. Thorpe and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, who were acquainted with everything, and
who seemed only to want Mr. Morland's consent, to consider Isabella's
engagement as the most fortunate circumstance imaginable for their
family, were allowed to join their counsels, and add their quota of
significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill up the measure
of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger sisters. To
Catherine's simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve seemed neither
kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its unkindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would
hardly have forborne pointing out, had its inconsistency been less their
friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart at ease by the sagacity of
their <div class="bookquote">``I know what'' (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>; and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit,
a display of family ingenuity, on one side in the mystery of an affected
secret, on the other of undefined discovery, all equally acute.

<p/>Catherine was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend again the next day, endeavouring to
support her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits and while away the many tedious hours before
the delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time
of reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more
desponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a
state of real distress. But when it did come, where could distress
be found? <div class="bookquote">``I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind
parents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to
forward my happiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the first three lines, and in one moment
all was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread over
Isabella's features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) spirits
became almost too high for control, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) called herself without
scruple the happiest of mortals.

<p/>Mrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) daughter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
visitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with
satisfaction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was <div class="bookquote">``dear
John''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``dear Catherine''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>at every word; <div class="bookquote">``dear Anne and dear Maria''
 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two <div class="bookquote">``dears''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>at
once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child
had now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) not only
bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the finest
fellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) praise.

<p/>The letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing
little more than this assurance of success; and every particular was
deferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabella
could well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland's
promise; his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what
means their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to
be resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
disinterested spirit took no concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) knew enough to feel secure of
an honourable and speedy establishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) imagination took a rapid
flight over its attendant felicities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw herself at the end of
a few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at
Fullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a
carriage at her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) command, a new name on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tickets, and a brilliant
exhibition of hoop rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) finger.

<p/>When the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had
only waited its arrival to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) journey to London, prepared to set
off. <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) alone in the parlour,
<div class="bookquote">``I am come to bid you good-bye.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Catherine wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) a good journey.
Without appearing to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) walked to the window, fidgeted about,
hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall not you be late at Devizes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) made no answer;
but after a minute's silence burst out with, <div class="bookquote">``A famous good thing this
marrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland's and Belle's.
What do you think of it, Miss Morland? I say it is no bad notion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I think it a very good one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you? That's honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to
matrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song `Going to One Wedding
Brings on Another?' I say, you will come to Belle's wedding, I hope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), if possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And then you know'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--twisting himself about and forcing a foolish
laugh--<div class="bookquote">``I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old
song.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with
Miss Tilney today, and must now be going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may
be together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a
fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why do you stay away so long?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine--finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
waited for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is kind of you, however--kind and good-natured. I shall not forget
it in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody
living, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only
good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you
have such--upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a
great deal better. Good morning to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton
before it is long, if not disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I hope--I hope, Miss Morland, you will not be sorry to see me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see.
Company is always cheerful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful company,
let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only be where
I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say I. And
I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a notion, Miss
Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to most
matters, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind
about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what
does not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only
have the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and
what care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good
income of my own; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not a penny, why, so much the better.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one
side, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which
has it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune
looking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest
thing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at
Fullerton, whenever it is convenient.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And away she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went. It was not in
the power of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) gallantry to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) longer. With such news to
communicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) departure was not
to be delayed by anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) nature to urge; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried away,
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to the undivided consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own happy address, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) explicit encouragement.

<p/>The agitation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had herself experienced on first learning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother's engagement made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion
in Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How
great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) disappointment! The important affair, which many words of
preparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother's arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was
comprehended in a wish for the young people's happiness, with a remark,
on the gentleman's side, in favour of Isabella's beauty, and on the
lady's, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising
insensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James's
going to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs. Allen.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but repeatedly
regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could have known
his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) intention, wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) went, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
should certainly have troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) best regards to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father
and mother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) kind compliments to all the Skinners.




<p/>CHAPTER 16


<p/>Catherine's expectations of pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visit in Milsom Street
were so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly
welcomed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of
the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) return, without spending many hours in
the examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appointment
preparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding
herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse
of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) seemed hardly so intimate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) as before; instead
of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a
family party, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never said so little, nor been so little agreeable;
and, in spite of their father's great civilities to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)--in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thanks, invitations, and compliments--it had been a release to get
away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to account for all this. It could not
be General Tilney's fault. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was perfectly agreeable and
good-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a
doubt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was tall and handsome, and Henry's father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could not
be accountable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) children's want of spirits, or for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) want of
enjoyment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) company. The former she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hoped at last might have
been accidental, and the latter she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could only attribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own
stupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave
a different explanation: <div class="bookquote">``It was all pride, pride, insufferable
haughtiness and pride! She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had long suspected the family to be very
high, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss
Tilney's she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never heard of in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) life! Not to do the honours of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) house with common good breeding! To behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) guest with such
superciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no superciliousness;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was very civil.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Don't defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)! And then the brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), who had appeared
so attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people's feelings are
incomprehensible. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hardly looked once at you the whole day?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not seem in good spirits.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my
aversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again, my dear
Catherine; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is unworthy of you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unworthy! I do not suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever thinks of me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is exactly what I say; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never thinks of you. Such fickleness!
Oh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John has
the most constant heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for
anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) only care to entertain and make me happy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! I know no harm of him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>); I do not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) of pride. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
is a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and John's
judgment--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet
them at the rooms.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And must I go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. But
do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know, will
be some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I beg;
that is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me to
death, I dare say; but I shall cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) very short. Ten to one but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>)
guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I shall
insist on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) conjecture to himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella's opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was
sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or
sister; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not credit there being any pride in their hearts.
The evening rewarded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) confidence; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was met by one with the same
kindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss
Tilney took pains to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), and Henry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to dance.

<p/>Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,
Captain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was at no loss for
the name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had
never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with great admiration, and even supposed it possible that
some people might think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handsomer than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, though, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) air was more assuming, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance less prepossessing.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly inferior; for,
within her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not only protested against every thought of
dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for finding it
possible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed that, whatever
might be our heroine's opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was not
of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities between the
brothers, nor persecutions to the lady. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cannot be the instigator of
the three villains in horsemen's greatcoats, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will hereafter
be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will drive off with
incredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by presentiments of
such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of having but a short
set to dance down, enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) usual happiness with Henry Tilney,
listening with sparkling eyes to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) said; and, in finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
irresistible, becoming so herself.

<p/>At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,
and, much to Catherine's dissatisfaction, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother away. They
retired whispering together; and, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) delicate sensibility did
not take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilney
must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) now
hastened to communicate to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother, in the hope of separating them
forever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner conveyed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sight without
very uneasy sensations. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suspense was of full five minutes' duration;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an hour, when
they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry's requesting
to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, Miss Thorpe, would have any objection
to dancing, as his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brother would be most happy to be introduced to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very sure Miss
Thorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was passed on to
the other, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) immediately walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother will not mind it, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``because I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
say before that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to think of it. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
might wish for a partner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is quite mistaken, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would not
dance upon any account in the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry smiled, and said, <div class="bookquote">``How very little trouble it can give you to
understand the motive of other people's actions.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? What do you mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What
is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person's feelings, age,
situation, and probable habits of life considered--but, How should I be
influenced, What would be my inducement in acting so and so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly
well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But pray tell me what you mean.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of the
consequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and
certainly bring on a disagreement between us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother's wish of
dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being
superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman's predictions were
verified. There was a something, however, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) words which repaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
for the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind so much
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and
almost forgetting where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looked up and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) with Captain Tilney preparing to give them
hands across.

<p/>Isabella shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of this
extraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it
was not quite enough for Catherine's comprehension, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
astonishment in very plain terms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not to
dance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And did Isabella never change her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) mind before?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! But, because--And your brother! After what you told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from me,
how could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) think of going to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprised
on your friend's account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I believed
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an open
attraction; her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) firmness, you know, could only be understood by
yourself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in general.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must be
to be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment;
and, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by
no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The friends</b></font>)</div><p/>The friends were not able to get together for any confidential discourse
till all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about the room
arm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself: <div class="bookquote">``I do not wonder at your
surprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is such a rattle!
Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would have given
the world to sit still.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why did not you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how I
abhor doing that. I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as long as I possibly could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would take no denial. You have no idea how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pressed me. I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to excuse me, and get some other partner--but no, not he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); after aspiring
to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could bear to think of;
and it was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted merely to dance, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted to be with
me. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had taken a very unlikely way to
prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches
and compliments; and so--and so then I found there would be no peace if
I did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am
so glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye was
upon us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very handsome indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Handsome! Yes, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may. I dare say people would admire him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
in general; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a florid
complexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very well. Amazingly
conceited, I am sure. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down several times, you know, in my
way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div><p/>When the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject
to discuss. James Morland's second letter was then received, and the
kind intentions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father fully explained. A living, of which Mr.
Morland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds
yearly value, was to be resigned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) son as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) should be
old enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no
niggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least equal
value, moreover, was assured as his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) future inheritance.

<p/>James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and
the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could
marry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had expected, was borne
by him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) without discontent. Catherine, whose expectations had been as
unfixed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's income, and whose judgment was now
entirely led by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother, felt equally well satisfied, and heartily
congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very charming indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, with a grave face. <div class="bookquote">``Mr.
Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said the gentle Mrs.
Thorpe, looking anxiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) daughter. <div class="bookquote">``I only wish I could do as
much. One could not expect more from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), you know. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) finds he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
can do more by and by, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) will, for I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) must be an
excellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to begin
on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate, you do
not consider how little you ever want, my dear.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to
be the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) sit down upon an
income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. For
myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in
the affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a young
woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say
when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child--but do not let us distress
our dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so
very handsome, you know. I always heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was a most excellent man;
and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a
suitable fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) would have come down with something more, for I am
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) must be a most liberal-minded man.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. But
everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to
do what they like with their own money.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine was hurt by these
insinuations. <div class="bookquote">``I am very sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that my father has promised
to do as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can afford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Isabella recollected herself. <div class="bookquote">``As to that, my sweet Catherine, there
cannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much
smaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that
makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if
our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should
not have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out.
There's the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are
to pass before your brother can hold the living.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, <div class="bookquote">``we perfectly see
into your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand the
present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a
noble honest affection.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's uncomfortable feelings began to lessen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) endeavoured to
believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella's
regret; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) at their next interview as cheerful and
amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had for a minute thought
otherwise. James soon followed his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) letter, and was received with the
most gratifying kindness.




<p/>CHAPTER 17


<p/>The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath; and
whether it should be the last was for some time a question, to which
Catherine listened with a beating heart. To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance with
the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole happiness seemed at stake, while the affair was in suspense,
and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should
be taken for another fortnight. What this additional fortnight was to
produce to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made
but a small part of Catherine's speculation. Once or twice indeed, since
James's engagement had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) what could be done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had got so
far as to indulge in a secret <div class="bookquote">``perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but in general the felicity of
being with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) for the present bounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) views: the present was now
comprised in another three weeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) happiness being certain for
that period, the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life was at such a distance as to excite
but little interest. In the course of the morning which saw this
business arranged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visited Miss Tilney, and poured forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
joyful feelings. It was doomed to be a day of trial. No sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) delight in Mr. Allen's lengthened stay than Miss Tilney
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father's having just determined upon quitting Bath
by the end of another week. Here was a blow! The past suspense of
the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment.
Catherine's countenance fell, and in a voice of most sincere concern she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
echoed Miss Tilney's concluding words, <div class="bookquote">``By the end of another week!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I
think a fair trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has been disappointed of some friends' arrival
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expected to meet here, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is now pretty well, is in a
hurry to get home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine dejectedly; <div class="bookquote">``if I had known
this before--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner, <div class="bookquote">``you would be so
good--it would make me very happy if--''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>The entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father put a stop to the civility, which Catherine
was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding.
After addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) usual politeness, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter and said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Eleanor, may I congratulate you on being
successful in your application to your fair friend?''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was just beginning to make the request, sir, as you came in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, proceed by all means. I know how much your heart is in it. My
daughter, Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, without leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter time
to speak, <div class="bookquote">``has been forming a very bold wish. We leave Bath, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) has
perhaps told you, on Saturday se’nnight. A letter from my steward tells
me that my presence is wanted at home; and being disappointed in my hope
of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here, some of
my very old friends, there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath. And
could we carry our selfish point with you, we should leave it without a
single regret. Can you, in short, be prevailed on to quit this scene
of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in
Gloucestershire? I am almost ashamed to make the request, though its
presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath
than yourself. Modesty such as yours--but not for the world would I pain
it by open praise. If you can be induced to honour us with a visit,
you will make us happy beyond expression. `Tis true, we can offer you
nothing like the gaieties of this lively place; we can tempt you neither
by amusement nor splendour, for our mode of living, as you see, is plain
and unpretending; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make
Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>Northanger Abbey! These were thrilling words, and wound up Catherine's
feelings to the highest point of ecstasy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grateful and gratified
heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of
tolerable calmness. To receive so flattering an invitation! To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
company so warmly solicited! Everything honourable and soothing, every
present enjoyment, and every future hope was contained in it; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
acceptance, with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma's approbation,
was eagerly given. <div class="bookquote">``I will write home directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and if they
do not object, as I dare say they will not--''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>General Tilney was not less sanguine, having already waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
excellent friends in Pulteney Street, and obtained their sanction of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) wishes. <div class="bookquote">``Since they can consent to part with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we may
expect philosophy from all the world.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Tilney was earnest, though gentle, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) secondary civilities, and
the affair became in a few minutes as nearly settled as this necessary
reference to Fullerton would allow.

<p/>The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine's feelings through
the varieties of suspense, security, and disappointment; but they were
now safely lodged in perfect bliss; and with spirits elated to rapture,
with Henry at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart, and Northanger Abbey on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hurried home to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) letter. Mr. and Mrs. Morland, relying on
the discretion of the friends to whom they had already entrusted their
daughter, felt no doubt of the propriety of an acquaintance which had
been formed under their eye, and sent therefore by return of post their
ready consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) visit in Gloucestershire. This indulgence, though
not more than Catherine had hoped for, completed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conviction of being
favoured beyond every other human creature, in friends and fortune,
circumstance and chance. Everything seemed to cooperate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
advantage. By the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first friends, the Allens, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preferences, had each known the happiness of a return.
Wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt attachment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been able to create it. The
affection of Isabella was to be secured to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in a sister. The Tilneys,
they, by whom, above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) desired to be favourably thought of,
outstripped even her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wishes in the flattering measures by which their
intimacy was to be continued. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was to be their chosen visitor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
was to be for weeks under the same roof with the person whose society
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) mostly prized--and, in addition to all the rest, this roof was to
be the roof of an abbey! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) passion for ancient edifices was next in
degree to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) passion for Henry Tilney--and castles and abbeys made
usually the charm of those reveries which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) image did not fill. To see
and explore either the ramparts and keep of the one, or the cloisters
of the other, had been for many weeks a darling wish, though to be more
than the visitor of an hour had seemed too nearly impossible for desire.
And yet, this was to happen. With all the chances against her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) of house,
hall, place, park, court, and cottage, Northanger turned up an abbey,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was to be its inhabitant. Its long, damp passages, its narrow
cells and ruined chapel, were to be within her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) daily reach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
could not entirely subdue the hope of some traditional legends, some
awful memorials of an injured and ill-fated nun.

<p/>It was wonderful that her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) friends should seem so little elated by the
possession of such a home, that the consciousness of it should be so
meekly borne. The power of early habit only could account for it. A
distinction to which they had been born gave no pride. Their superiority
of abode was no more to them than their superiority of person.

<p/>Many were the inquiries she (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) was eager to make of Miss Tilney; but so
active were her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thoughts, that when these inquiries were answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
was hardly more assured than before, of Northanger Abbey having been
a richly endowed convent at the time of the Reformation, of its having
fallen into the hands of an ancestor of the Tilneys on its dissolution,
of a large portion of the ancient building still making a part of the
present dwelling although the rest was decayed, or of its standing low
in a valley, sheltered from the north and east by rising woods of oak.




<p/>CHAPTER 18


<p/>With a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two
or three days had passed away, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seeing Isabella for more than
a few minutes together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began first to be sensible of this, and
to sigh for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conversation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walked along the pump-room one
morning, by Mrs. Allen's side, without anything to say or to hear; and
scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) felt a five minutes' longing of friendship, before the
object of it appeared, and inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to a secret conference, led the
way to a seat. <div class="bookquote">``This is my favourite place,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) as they sat
down on a bench between the doors, which commanded a tolerable view of
everybody entering at either; <div class="bookquote">``it is so out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, observing that Isabella's eyes were continually bent towards
one door or the other, as in eager expectation, and remembering how
often she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been falsely accused of being arch, thought the present a
fine opportunity for being really so; and therefore gaily said, <div class="bookquote">``Do not
be uneasy, Isabella, James will soon be here.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha! My dear creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``do not think me such a simpleton
as to be always wanting to confine him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) to my elbow. It would be hideous
to be always together; we should be the jest of the place. And so you
are going to Northanger! I am amazingly glad of it. It is one of the
finest old places in England, I understand. I shall depend upon a most
particular description of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall certainly have the best in my power to give. But who are you
looking for? Are your sisters coming?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not looking for anybody. One's eyes must be somewhere, and you
know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine, when my thoughts are an
hundred miles off. I am amazingly absent; I believe I am the most absent
creature in the world. Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a
certain stamp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I thought, Isabella, you had something in particular to tell me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Yes, and so I have. But here is a proof of what I was saying. My
poor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just
had a letter from John; you can guess the contents.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, I cannot.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My sweet love, do not be so abominably affected. What can he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) write
about, but yourself? You know he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is over head and ears in love with
you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me, dear Isabella!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, my sweetest Catherine, this is being quite absurd! Modesty, and
all that, is very well in its way, but really a little common honesty is
sometimes quite as becoming. I have no idea of being so overstrained!
It is fishing for compliments. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) attentions were such as a child must
have noticed. And it was but half an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) left Bath that you
gave him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the most positive encouragement. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says so in this letter,
says that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as good as made you an offer, and that you received his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
advances in the kindest way; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wants me to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) suit,
and say all manner of pretty things to you. So it is in vain to affect
ignorance.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, with all the earnestness of truth, expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) astonishment
at such a charge, protesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) innocence of every thought of Mr.
Thorpe's being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and the consequent impossibility of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) having ever intended to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``As to any attentions on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
side, I do declare, upon my honour, I never was sensible of them for a
moment--except just his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asking me to dance the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) coming.
And as to making me an offer, or anything like it, there must be some
unaccountable mistake. I could not have misunderstood a thing of that
kind, you know! And, as I ever wish to be believed, I solemnly protest
that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us. The last half
hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went away! It must be all and completely a mistake--for I
did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) once that whole morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But that you certainly did, for you spent the whole morning in Edgar's
Buildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and I am pretty
sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you
left the house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you? Well, if you say it, it was so, I dare say--but for the life
of me, I cannot recollect it. I do remember now being with you, and
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as well as the rest--but that we were ever alone for five
minutes--However, it is not worth arguing about, for whatever might pass
on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) side, you must be convinced, by my having no recollection of it,
that I never thought, nor expected, nor wished for anything of the kind
from him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). I am excessively concerned that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should have any regard for
me--but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side; I never had
the smallest idea of it. Pray undeceive him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as soon as you can, and tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) I beg his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pardon--that is--I do not know what I ought to say--but
make him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) understand what I mean, in the properest way. I would not speak
disrespectfully of a brother of yours, Isabella, I am sure; but you know
very well that if I could think of one man more than another--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not
the person.''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>Isabella was silent. <div class="bookquote">``My dear friend, you must not be angry
with me. I cannot suppose your brother cares so very much about me. And,
you know, we shall still be sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-with a blush-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``there are more ways than one of our being
sisters. But where am I wandering to? Well, my dear Catherine, the case
seems to be that you are determined against poor John--is not it so?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly cannot return his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) affection, and as certainly never meant
to encourage it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Since that is the case, I am sure I shall not tease you any further.
John desired me to speak to you on the subject, and therefore I have.
But I confess, as soon as I read his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) letter, I thought it a very
foolish, imprudent business, and not likely to promote the good of
either; for what were you to live upon, supposing you came together? You
have both of you something, to be sure, but it is not a trifle that will
support a family nowadays; and after all that romancers may say, there
is no doing without money. I only wonder John could think of it; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
could not have received my last.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You do acquit me, then, of anything wrong?--You are convinced that I
never meant to deceive your brother, never suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of liking me
till this moment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! As to that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>answered Isabella laughingly, <div class="bookquote">``I do not pretend to
determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been. All
that is best known to yourself. A little harmless flirtation or so will
occur, and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one
wishes to stand by. But you may be assured that I am the last person in
the world to judge you severely. All those things should be allowed for
in youth and high spirits. What one means one day, you know, one may not
mean the next. Circumstances change, opinions alter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But my opinion of your brother never did alter; it was always the same.
You are describing what never happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dearest Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>continued the other without at all listening to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an
engagement before you knew what you were about. I do not think anything
would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely
to oblige my brother, because he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is my brother, and who perhaps after
all, you know, might be just as happy without you, for people seldom
know what they would be at, young men especially, they are so amazingly
changeable and inconstant. What I say is, why should a brother's
happiness be dearer to me than a friend's? You know I carry my notions
of friendship pretty high. But, above all things, my dear Catherine, do
not be in a hurry. Take my word for it, that if you are in too great
a hurry, you will certainly live to repent it. Tilney says there is
nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own
affections, and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is very right. Ah! Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) comes; never
mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) will not see us, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, looking up, perceived Captain Tilney; and Isabella,
earnestly fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) spoke, soon caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
approached immediately, and took the seat to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) movements invited
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) first address made Catherine start. Though spoken low, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could distinguish, <div class="bookquote">``What! Always to be watched, in person or by proxy!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Psha, nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/Thorpe/Isabella Thorpe</b></font>)</div>was Isabella's answer in the same half whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Why
do you put such things into my head? If I could believe it--my spirit,
you know, is pretty independent.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish your heart were independent. That would be enough for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My heart, indeed! What can you have to do with hearts? You men have
none of you any hearts.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If we have not hearts, we have eyes; and they give us torment enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do they? I am sorry for it; I am sorry they find anything so
disagreeable in me. I will look another way. I hope this pleases you''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) back on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``I hope your eyes are not tormented now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never more so; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view--at
once too much and too little.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine heard all this, and quite out of countenance, could listen
no longer. Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) rose up, and saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) should join Mrs. Allen, proposed
their walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was so
amazingly tired, and it was so odious to parade about the pump-room;
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) moved from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) seat she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) should miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) sisters; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was
expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) sisters every moment; so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dearest Catherine must
excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could be
stubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their
returning home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and walked out of the pump-room, leaving
Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) thus leave them. It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) that Captain Tilney was falling
in love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>);
unconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was as
certain and well acknowledged as her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) engagement. To doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) truth
or good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their
conversation her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) manner had been odd. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wished Isabella had talked
more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) usual self, and not so much about money, and had not
looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) should not perceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) admiration! Catherine longed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a
hint of it, to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) guard, and prevent all the pain which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother.

<p/>The compliment of John Thorpe's affection did not make amends for this
thoughtlessness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was almost as far from believing as
from wishing it to be sincere; for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had not forgotten that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
could mistake, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) assertion of the offer and of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) encouragement
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mistakes could sometimes be very egregious.
In vanity, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gained but little; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chief profit was in
wonder. That he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) should think it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) while to fancy himself in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a matter of lively astonishment. Isabella talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
attentions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had never been sensible of any; but Isabella had said
many things which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hoped had been spoken in haste, and would never
be said again; and upon this she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was glad to rest altogether for present
ease and comfort.




<p/>CHAPTER 19


<p/>A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to
suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, could not help watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) closely. The result of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered creature.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), indeed, surrounded only by their immediate friends
in Edgar's Buildings or Pulteney Street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) change of manners was so
trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed unnoticed.
A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted absence of
mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would occasionally come
across her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but had nothing worse appeared, that might only have spread
a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But when Catherine saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
in public, admitting Captain Tilney's attentions as readily as they were
offered, and allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) almost an equal share with James in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice
and smiles, the alteration became too positive to be passed over. What
could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend could be at,
was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comprehension. Isabella could not be aware of the pain
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was inflicting; but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which
Catherine could not but resent. James was the sufferer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
grave and uneasy; and however careless of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) present comfort the woman
might be who had given him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it was always an object.
For poor Captain Tilney too she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was greatly concerned. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looks
did not please her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) name was a passport to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goodwill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
thought with sincere compassion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) approaching disappointment; for,
in spite of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had believed herself to overhear in the pump-room,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) behaviour was so incompatible with a knowledge of Isabella's
engagement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not, upon reflection, imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) aware of it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother as a rival, but if more had seemed
implied, the fault must have been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) misapprehension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wished, by
a gentle remonstrance, to remind Isabella of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) situation, and make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) aware of this double unkindness; but for remonstrance, either
opportunity or comprehension was always against her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). If able to suggest
a hint, Isabella could never understand it. In this distress, the
intended departure of the Tilney family became her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) chief consolation;
their journey into Gloucestershire was to take place within a few days,
and Captain Tilney's removal would at least restore peace to every heart
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own. But Captain Tilney had at present no intention of removing;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was not to be of the party to Northanger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was to continue at Bath.
When Catherine knew this, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution was directly made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke to
Henry Tilney on the subject, regretting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother's evident partiality
for Miss Thorpe, and entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to make known her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) prior engagement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother does know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>was Henry's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stay here?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
eagerly continued, <div class="bookquote">``Why do not you persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to go away? The longer
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stays, the worse it will be for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at last. Pray advise him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
own sake, and for everybody's sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence will
in time make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) comfortable again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can have no hope here, and it
is only staying to be miserable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am sure my brother would not wish to do that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine blushed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Isabella is wrong. But I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cannot mean to torment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is very much attached to my
brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has been in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever since they first met, and
while my father's consent was uncertain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) fretted herself almost into
a fever. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) must be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I understand: she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will neither love so well, nor flirt so
well, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause, Catherine resumed with, <div class="bookquote">``Then you do not believe
Isabella so very much attached to my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can have no opinion on that subject.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But what can your brother mean? If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) engagement, what can he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother's heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My brother's heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves. To
be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are before
you. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young
man; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has had about a week's acquaintance with your friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has
known her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) engagement almost as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has known her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, after some moments' consideration, <div class="bookquote">``you may be
able to guess at your brother's intentions from all this; but I am sure
I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak to
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would go.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Morland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, <div class="bookquote">``in this amiable solicitude for your
brother's comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not carried
a little too far? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thank you, either on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own account or
Miss Thorpe's, for supposing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) affection, or at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) good
behaviour, is only to be secured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seeing nothing of Captain
Tilney? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) safe only in solitude? Or is her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) heart constant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
only when unsolicited by anyone else? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) cannot think this--and you may
be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would not have you think it. I will not say, `Do not
be uneasy,' because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as
little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment
of your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that
real jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no
disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open
to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what
is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will
never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still to look doubtful and grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Though
Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) will probably remain but a
very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) leave of absence
will soon expire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) must return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) regiment. And what will then
be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella Thorpe for
a fortnight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney's
passion for a month.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine would contend no longer against comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had resisted its
approaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
captive. Henry Tilney must know best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blamed herself for the extent
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject
again.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution was supported by Isabella's behaviour in their parting
interview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine's stay in
Pulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) uneasiness, or make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quit them in apprehension. James was in
excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tenderness
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend seemed rather the first feeling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart; but that
at such a moment was allowable; and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lover a flat
contradiction, and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hand; but Catherine remembered
Henry's instructions, and placed it all to judicious affection. The
embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones may be fancied.




<p/>CHAPTER 20


<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Allen were sorry to lose their young friend, whose good
humour and cheerfulness had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) a valuable companion, and in the
promotion of whose enjoyment their own had been gently increased. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
happiness in going with Miss Tilney, however, prevented their wishing
it otherwise; and, as they were to remain only one more week in Bath
themselves, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) quitting them now would not long be felt. Mr. Allen
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to Milsom Street, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was to breakfast, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
seated with the kindest welcome among her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) new friends; but so great was
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) agitation in finding herself as one of the family, and so fearful
was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) of not doing exactly what was right, and of not being able to
preserve their good opinion, that, in the embarrassment of the first
five minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could almost have wished to return with him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to
Pulteney Street.

<p/>Miss Tilney's manners and Henry's smile soon did away some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
unpleasant feelings; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was far from being at ease; nor could
the incessant attentions of the general himself entirely reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>).
Nay, perverse as it seemed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might not have felt
less, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) been less attended to. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) comfort--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
continual solicitations that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would eat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) often-expressed
fears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) seeing nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) taste--though never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) life
before had she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) beheld half such variety on a breakfast-table--made it
impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to forget for a moment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was a visitor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
felt utterly unworthy of such respect, and knew not how to reply to it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) tranquillity was not improved by the general's impatience for the
appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) eldest son, nor by the displeasure he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) expressed at his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
laziness when Captain Tilney at last came down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was quite pained by
the severity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father's reproof, which seemed disproportionate to
the offence; and much was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) concern increased when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) found herself
the principal cause of the lecture, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) tardiness was chiefly
resented from being disrespectful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). This was placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) in a
very uncomfortable situation, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt great compassion for Captain
Tilney, without being able to hope for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) goodwill.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) listened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father in silence, and attempted not any defence,
which confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) in fearing that the inquietude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mind, on
Isabella's account, might, by keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) long sleepless, have been
the real cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) rising late. It was the first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) being
decidedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) company, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had hoped to be now able to form
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) scarcely heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) voice while his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father
remained in the room; and even afterwards, so much were his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spirits
affected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could distinguish nothing but these words, in a whisper to
Eleanor, <div class="bookquote">``How glad I shall be when you are all off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>The bustle of going was not pleasant. The clock struck ten while the
trunks were carrying down, and the general had fixed to be out of Milsom
Street by that hour. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) greatcoat, instead of being brought for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
to put on directly, was spread out in the curricle in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was to
accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) son. The middle seat of the chaise was not drawn out,
though there were three people to go in it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter's maid had
so crowded it with parcels that Miss Morland would not have room to sit;
and, so much was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) influenced by this apprehension when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
in, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had some difficulty in saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own new writing-desk from
being thrown out into the street. At last, however, the door was closed
upon the three females, and they set off at the sober pace in which
the handsome, highly fed four horses of a gentleman usually perform a
journey of thirty miles: such was the distance of Northanger from Bath,
to be now divided into two equal stages. Catherine's spirits revived as
they drove from the door; for with Miss Tilney she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt no restraint;
and, with the interest of a road entirely new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), of an abbey
before, and a curricle behind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) caught the last view of Bath without
any regret, and met with every milestone before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) expected it. The
tediousness of a two hours' wait at Petty France, in which there was
nothing to be done but to eat without being hungry, and loiter about
without anything to see, next followed--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) admiration of the style
in which they travelled, of the fashionable chaise and four--postilions
handsomely liveried, rising so regularly in their stirrups, and
numerous outriders properly mounted, sunk a little under this consequent
inconvenience. Had their party been perfectly agreeable, the delay would
have been nothing; but General Tilney, though so charming a man, seemed
always a check upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children's spirits, and scarcely anything was
said but by himself; the observation of which, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discontent at
whatever the inn afforded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) angry impatience at the waiters, made
Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and appeared to lengthen
the two hours into four. At last, however, the order of release was
given; and much was Catherine then surprised by the general's proposal
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) taking his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) place in his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) son's curricle for the rest of the
journey: <div class="bookquote">``the day was fine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seeing as much of
the country as possible.''

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/>The remembrance of Mr. Allen's opinion, respecting young men's open
carriages, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blush at the mention of such a plan, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first
thought was to decline it; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) second was of greater deference for
General Tilney's judgment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could not propose anything improper for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and, in the course of a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found herself with Henry
in the curricle, as happy a being as ever existed. A very short trial
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that a curricle was the prettiest equipage in the world;
the chaise and four wheeled off with some grandeur, to be sure, but it
was a heavy and troublesome business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not easily forget
its having stopped two hours at Petty France. Half the time would
have been enough for the curricle, and so nimbly were the light horses
disposed to move, that, had not the general chosen to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Petty</b></font>) own
carriage lead the way, they could have passed it with ease in half a
minute. But the merit of the curricle did not all belong to the horses;
Henry drove so well--so quietly--without making any disturbance,
without parading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), or swearing at them: so different from the only
gentleman-coachman whom it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) power to compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with! And
then his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat sat so well, and the innumerable capes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) greatcoat
looked so becomingly important! To be driven by him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), next to being
dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), was certainly the greatest happiness in the world. In
addition to every other delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had now that of listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own praise; of being thanked at least, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister's account, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) kindness in thus becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visitor; of hearing it ranked as real
friendship, and described as creating real gratitude. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
said, was uncomfortably circumstanced--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had no female companion--and,
in the frequent absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father, was sometimes without any
companion at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can that be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. <div class="bookquote">``Are not you with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Northanger is not more than half my home; I have an establishment at
my own house in Woodston, which is nearly twenty miles from my father's,
and some of my time is necessarily spent there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How sorry you must be for that!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always sorry to leave Eleanor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; but besides your affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), you must be so fond of
the abbey! After being used to such a home as the abbey, an ordinary
parsonage-house must be very disagreeable.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) smiled, and said, <div class="bookquote">``You have formed a very favourable idea of the
abbey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure, I have. Is not it a fine old place, just like what one
reads about?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such
as `what one reads about' may produce? Have you a stout heart? Nerves
fit for sliding panels and tapestry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! yes--I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there
would be so many people in the house--and besides, it has never been
uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back
to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly
lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire--nor be obliged to spread
our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.
But you must be aware that when a young lady is -LRB-by whatever means-RRB-
introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is always lodged apart from
the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the
house, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up
a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment
never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years
before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind
misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber--too lofty and
extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take
in its size--its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as
life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even
a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And
what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,
but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a
ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace
the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so
incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your
eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,
gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.
To raise your spirits, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) gives you reason to suppose that
the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs
you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this
parting cordial she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>) curtsies off--you listen to the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorothy</b></font>)
receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you--and when,
with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,
with increased alarm, that it has no lock.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot
really happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.
Well, what then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After
surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to
rest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at
farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a
violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice
to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains--and during
the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think
you discern -LRB-for your lamp is not extinguished-RRB- one part of the hanging
more violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your
curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly
arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine
this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in
the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,
and on opening it, a door will immediately appear--which door, being
only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,
succeed in opening--and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through
it into a small vaulted room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a
secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel
of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple
an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,
and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very
remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another
a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of
torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,
and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own
apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your
eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony
and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you
had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will
eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into
every drawer--but for some time without discovering anything of
importance--perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At
last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will
open--a roll of paper appears--you seize it--it contains many sheets of
manuscript--you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,
but scarcely have you been able to decipher `Oh! Thou--whomsoever thou
mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may
fall'--when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in
total darkness.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! No, no--do not say so. Well, go on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>But Henry was too much amused by the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had raised to be able
to carry it farther; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could no longer command solemnity either of
subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own fancy
in the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really
meeting with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) related. <div class="bookquote">``Miss Tilney, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was sure, would never
put her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) into such a chamber as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thou</b></font>) had described! She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was not at all
afraid.''

 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/>As they drew near the end of their journey, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) impatience for a sight
of the abbey--for some time suspended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) conversation on subjects
very different--returned in full force, and every bend in the road was
expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey
stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the
sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But so
low did the building stand, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found herself passing through the
great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without
having discerned even an antique chimney.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had any right to be surprised, but there was a
something in this mode of approach which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) certainly had not expected.
To pass between lodges of a modern appearance, to find herself with such
ease in the very precincts of the abbey, and driven so rapidly along a
smooth, level road of fine gravel, without obstacle, alarm, or solemnity
of any kind, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as odd and inconsistent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not long
at leisure, however, for such considerations. A sudden scud of rain,
driving full in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face, made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to observe anything
further, and fixed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts on the welfare of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) new straw
bonnet; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was actually under the abbey walls, was springing, with
Henry's assistance, from the carriage, was beneath the shelter of the
old porch, and had even passed on to the hall, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend and
the general were waiting to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), without feeling one awful
foreboding of future misery to herself, or one moment's suspicion of any
past scenes of horror being acted within the solemn edifice. The breeze
had not seemed to waft the sighs of the murdered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); it had wafted
nothing worse than a thick mizzling rain; and having given a good shake
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ready to be shown into the common drawing-room,
and capable of considering where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was.

<p/>An abbey! Yes, it was delightful to be really in an abbey! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
doubted, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked round the room, whether anything within her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
observation would have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the consciousness. The furniture was in
all the profusion and elegance of modern taste. The fireplace, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had expected the ample width and ponderous carving of former times, was
contracted to a Rumford, with slabs of plain though handsome marble, and
ornaments over it of the prettiest English china. The windows, to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked with peculiar dependence, from having heard the general talk
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rumford</b></font>) preserving them in their Gothic form with reverential care, were
yet less what her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fancy had portrayed. To be sure, the pointed arch
was preserved--the form of them was Gothic--they might be even
casements--but every pane was so large, so clear, so light! To an
imagination which had hoped for the smallest divisions, and the heaviest
stone-work, for painted glass, dirt, and cobwebs, the difference was
very distressing.

<p/>The general, perceiving how her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye was employed, began to talk of the
smallness of the room and simplicity of the furniture, where everything,
being for daily use, pretended only to comfort, etc.; flattering
himself, however, that there were some apartments in the Abbey not
unworthy her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice--and was proceeding to mention the costly gilding
of one in particular, when, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stopped short to
pronounce it with surprise within twenty minutes of five! This seemed
the word of separation, and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss
Tilney in such a manner as convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) that the strictest punctuality
to the family hours would be expected at Northanger.

<p/>Returning through the large and lofty hall, they ascended a broad
staircase of shining oak, which, after many flights and many
landing-places, brought them upon a long, wide gallery. On one side it
had a range of doors, and it was lighted on the other by windows which
Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle, before
Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber, and scarcely staying to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
would find it comfortable, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) with an anxious entreaty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
would make as little alteration as possible in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) dress.




<p/>CHAPTER 21


<p/>A moment's glance was enough to satisfy Catherine that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) apartment
was very unlike the one which Henry had endeavoured to alarm her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by the
description of. It was by no means unreasonably large, and contained
neither tapestry nor velvet. The walls were papered, the floor was
carpeted; the windows were neither less perfect nor more dim than those
of the drawing-room below; the furniture, though not of the latest
fashion, was handsome and comfortable, and the air of the room
altogether far from uncheerful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart instantaneously at ease on
this point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolved to lose no time in particular examination of
anything, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) greatly dreaded disobliging the general by any delay.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habit therefore was thrown off with all possible haste, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
preparing to unpin the linen package, which the chaise-seat had conveyed
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) immediate accommodation, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eye suddenly fell on a large
high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.
The sight of it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) start; and, forgetting everything else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An
immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?
Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into
it--cost me what it may, I will look into it--and directly too--by
daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) advanced and
examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker
wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the
same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end
were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps
prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was
a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,
but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
not, in whatever direction she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took it, believe the last letter to be
a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was
a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not
originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the
Tilney family?

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,
with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolved at all hazards
to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for
something seemed to resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) efforts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised the lid a few inches;
but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
starting, quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This
ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mistress to be of
use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), it
recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to the sense of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ought to be doing, and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>),
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dressing without further delay. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) progress was not quick, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thoughts and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated
to interest and alarm; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared not waste a moment upon
a second attempt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not remain many paces from the chest. At
length, however, having slipped one arm into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gown, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) toilette
seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) curiosity might
safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate
should be the exertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) strength, that, unless secured by
supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With
this spirit she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sprang forward, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) confidence did not deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) astonished eyes
the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one
end of the chest in undisputed possession!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,
anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the
rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,
was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. <div class="bookquote">``That is
a curious old chest, is not it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily
closed it and turned away to the glass. <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to say how
many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this
room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might
sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that
its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at
least out of the way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had no leisure for speech, being at once blushing, tying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
gown, and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch. Miss
Tilney gently hinted her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) fear of being late; and in half a minute they
ran downstairs together, in an alarm not wholly unfounded, for General
Tilney was pacing the drawing-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hand, and having,
on the very instant of their entering, pulled the bell with violence,
ordered <div class="bookquote">``Dinner to be on table directly!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spoke, and sat pale
and breathless, in a most humble mood, concerned for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) children, and
detesting old chests; and the general, recovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) politeness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), spent the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) time in scolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter for
so foolishly hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fair friend, who was absolutely out of breath
from haste, when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the
world: but Catherine could not at all get over the double distress
of having involved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton
herself, till they were happily seated at the dinner-table, when the
general's complacent smiles, and a good appetite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, restored
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to peace. The dining-parlour was a noble room, suitable in its
dimensions to a much larger drawing-room than the one in common use, and
fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the
unpractised eye of Catherine, who saw little more than its spaciousness
and the number of their attendants. Of the former, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke aloud
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) admiration; and the general, with a very gracious countenance,
acknowledged that it was by no means an ill-sized room, and further
confessed that, though as careless on such subjects as most people, he (<font color='blue'><b>subjects</b></font>)
did look upon a tolerably large eating-room as one of the necessaries
of life; he (<font color='blue'><b>subjects</b></font>) supposed, however, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) must have been used to much
better-sized apartments at Mr. Allen's?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>was Catherine's honest assurance; <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Allen's
dining-parlour was not more than half as large,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never
seen so large a room as this in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life. The general's good humour
increased. Why, as he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had such rooms, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) thought it would be simple not
to make use of them; but, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) believed there might be
more comfort in rooms of only half their size. Mr. Allen's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was
sure, must be exactly of the true size for rational happiness.

<p/>The evening passed without any further disturbance, and, in the
occasional absence of General Tilney, with much positive cheerfulness.
It was only in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) presence that Catherine felt the smallest fatigue
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) journey; and even then, even in moments of languor or
restraint, a sense of general happiness preponderated, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends in Bath without one wish of being with them.

<p/>The night was stormy; the wind had been rising at intervals the whole
afternoon; and by the time the party broke up, it blew and rained
violently. Catherine, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) crossed the hall, listened to the tempest
with sensations of awe; and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard it rage round a corner of
the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door, felt
for the first time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was really in an abbey. Yes, these were
characteristic sounds; they brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recollection a countless
variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes, which such buildings
had witnessed, and such storms ushered in; and most heartily did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entrance within walls
so solemn! She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken
gallants. Henry had certainly been only in jest in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
that morning. In a house so furnished, and so guarded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could have
nothing to explore or to suffer, and might go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bedroom as securely
as if it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own chamber at Fullerton. Thus wisely fortifying
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) proceeded upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was enabled, especially on
perceiving that Miss Tilney slept only two doors from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), to enter
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) room with a tolerably stout heart; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spirits were immediately
assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire. <div class="bookquote">``How much better is
this,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) walked to the fender--<div class="bookquote">``how much better to find a
fire ready lit, than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the
family are in bed, as so many poor girls have been obliged to do, and
then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a
faggot! How glad I am that Northanger is what it is! If it had been like
some other places, I do not know that, in such a night as this, I could
have answered for my courage: but now, to be sure, there is nothing to
alarm one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked round the room. The window curtains seemed in motion. It
could be nothing but the violence of the wind penetrating through the
divisions of the shutters; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) stepped boldly forward, carelessly
humming a tune, to assure herself of its being so, peeped courageously
behind each curtain, saw nothing on either low window seat to scare her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>),
and on placing a hand against the shutter, felt the strongest conviction
of the wind's force. A glance at the old chest, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) turned away from
this examination, was not without its use; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) scorned the causeless
fears of an idle fancy, and began with a most happy indifference to
prepare herself for bed. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) time; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) should not hurry
herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not care if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were the last person up in the house.
But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would not make up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fire; that would seem cowardly, as if
she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wished for the protection of light after she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were in bed.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>The fire
therefore died away, and Catherine, having spent the best part of an
hour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arrangements, was beginning to think of stepping into bed,
when, on giving a parting glance round the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was struck by the
appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in
a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice before.
Henry's words, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observation at first, immediately rushed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and though
there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it
was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) candle and
looked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but
it was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key
was in the door, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a strange fancy to look into it; not,
however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was
so very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not sleep
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution on
a chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn
it; but it resisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believed herself
successful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down the
chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything
seemed to speak the awfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation. To retire to bed,
however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be
impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) applied herself to the
key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with
the determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and
having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by
bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers
appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in
the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in
all probability a cavity of importance.

<p/>Catherine's heart beat quick, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) courage did not fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). With a
cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fingers
grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.
With less alarm and greater eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seized a second, a third, a
fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not
one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,
the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the
middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``never from
the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the
cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ill success thus
far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was
about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was some time however before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could unfasten the door,
the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of
the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
search; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back
into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart fluttered, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
knees trembled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks grew pale. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seized, with an unsteady
hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain
written characters; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acknowledged with awful sensations
this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved
instantly to peruse every line before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) attempted to rest.

<p/>The dimness of the light her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) candle emitted made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turn to it with
alarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some
hours to burn; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might not have any greater difficulty in
distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A
lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a
few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a
remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.
Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust
of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment.
Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a
sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat
stood on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forehead, the manuscript fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, and groping
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way to the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of
agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes in
sleep that night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt must be entirely out of the question. With
a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,
repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast
seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully
found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it
to be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?
By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly
strange that it should fall to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lot to discover it! Till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had made
herself mistress of its contents, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could have neither repose
nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was determined to peruse
it. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
shuddered, tossed about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The
storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even
than the wind, which struck at intervals on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) startled ear. The very
curtains of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another
the lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to
enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than
once her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after
hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed
by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
unknowingly fell fast asleep.




<p/>CHAPTER 22


<p/>The housemaid's folding back her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) window-shutters at eight o’clock the
next day was the sound which first roused Catherine; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes, wondering that they could ever have been closed, on objects of
cheerfulness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fire was already burning, and a bright morning
had succeeded the tempest of the night. Instantaneously, with the
consciousness of existence, returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recollection of the manuscript;
and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid's going away,
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the
roll on its falling to the ground, and flew back to enjoy the luxury
of their perusal on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) pillow. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) now plainly saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) must not
expect a manuscript of equal length with the generality of what she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had
shuddered over in books, for the roll, seeming to consist entirely of
small disjointed sheets, was altogether but of trifling size, and much
less than she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had supposed it to be at first.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) started at its import.
Could it be possible, or did not her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) senses play her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) false? An inventory
of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before
her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) held a washing-bill
in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with
little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing
new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in each. Two
others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more
interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.
And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first
cramp line, <div class="bookquote">``To poultice chestnut mare'' (<font color='red'><b>a farrier</b></font>)</div>--a farrier's bill! Such was the
collection of papers -LRB-left perhaps, as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could then suppose, by the
negligence of a servant in the place whence she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had taken them-RRB- which
had filled her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) with expectation and alarm, and robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) of half her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
night's rest! She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of
the chest have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) wisdom? A corner of it, catching her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) eye as
she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). Nothing could now
be clearer than the absurdity of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) recent fancies. To suppose that a
manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in
a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!--Or that she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) should be the
first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was
open to all!

<p/>How could she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) have so imposed on herself? Heaven forbid that Henry
Tilney should ever know her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) folly! And it was in a great measure his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
own doing, for had not the cabinet appeared so exactly to agree with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
description of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) adventures, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) should never have felt the smallest
curiosity about it. This was the only comfort that occurred. Impatient
to get rid of those hateful evidences of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) folly, those detestable
papers then scattered over the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) rose directly, and folding them
up as nearly as possible in the same shape as before, returned them
to the same spot within the cabinet, with a very hearty wish that no
untoward accident might ever bring them forward again, to disgrace her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
even with herself.

<p/>Why the locks should have been so difficult to open, however, was still
something remarkable, for she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could now manage them with perfect ease.
In this there was surely something mysterious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) indulged in the
flattering suggestion for half a minute, till the possibility of the
door's having been at first unlocked, and of being herself its fastener,
darted into her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head, and cost her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) another blush.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) got away as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could from a room in which her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) conduct
produced such unpleasant reflections, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) way with all speed
to the breakfast-parlour, as it had been pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) by Miss
Tilney the evening before. Henry was alone in it; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) immediate hope
of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) having been undisturbed by the tempest, with an arch reference
to the character of the building they inhabited, was rather distressing.
For the world would she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) not have her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) weakness suspected, and yet,
unequal to an absolute falsehood, was constrained to acknowledge that
the wind had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) awake a little. <div class="bookquote">``But we have a charming morning
after it,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) added, desiring to get rid of the subject; <div class="bookquote">``and storms
and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over. What beautiful
hyacinths! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how might you learn? By accident or argument?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your sister taught me; I cannot tell how. Mrs. Allen used to take
pains, year after year, to make me like them; but I never could, till
I saw them the other day in Milsom Street; I am naturally indifferent
about flowers.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But now you love a hyacinth. So much the better. You have gained a new
source of enjoyment, and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness
as possible. Besides, a taste for flowers is always desirable in your
sex, as a means of getting you out of doors, and tempting you to more
frequent exercise than you would otherwise take. And though the love
of a hyacinth may be rather domestic, who can tell, the sentiment once
raised, but you may in time come to love a rose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors. The pleasure
of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me, and in fine weather
I am out more than half my time. Mamma says I am never within.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, however, I am pleased that you have learnt to love
a hyacinth. The mere habit of learning to love is the thing; and a
teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing. Has my
sister a pleasant mode of instruction?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the
entrance of the general, whose smiling compliments announced a happy
state of mind, but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not
advance her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) composure.

<p/>The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine's notice
when they were seated at table; and, luckily, it had been the general's
choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was enchanted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) approbation of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) taste, confessed it
to be neat and simple, thought it right to encourage the manufacture of
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) country; and for his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) part, to his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) uncritical palate, the tea was as
well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire, as from that of Dresden
or Save. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago.
The manufacture was much improved since that time; he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had seen some
beautiful specimens when last in town, and had he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) not been perfectly
without vanity of that kind, might have been tempted to order a new
set. He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) trusted, however, that an opportunity might ere long occur of
selecting one--though not for himself. Catherine was probably the only
one of the party who did not understand him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>).

<p/>Shortly after breakfast Henry left them for Woodston, where business
required and would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) two or three days. They all attended in
the hall to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) horse, and immediately on re-entering the
breakfast-room, Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching
another glimpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) figure. <div class="bookquote">``This is a somewhat heavy call upon your
brother's fortitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>observed the general to Eleanor. <div class="bookquote">``Woodston will
make but a sombre appearance today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it a pretty place?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>asked Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What say you, Eleanor? Speak your opinion, for ladies can best tell the
taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men. I think it would be
acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations. The
house stands among fine meadows facing the south-east, with an excellent
kitchen-garden in the same aspect; the walls surrounding which I built
and stocked myself about ten years ago, for the benefit of my son. It
is a family living, Miss Morland; and the property in the place being
chiefly my own, you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad
one. Did Henry's income depend solely on this living, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not be
ill-provided for. Perhaps it may seem odd, that with only two younger
children, I should think any profession necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and certainly
there are moments when we could all wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) disengaged from every tie
of business. But though I may not exactly make converts of you young
ladies, I am sure your father, Miss Morland, would agree with me in
thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment. The
money is nothing, it is not an object, but employment is the thing.
Even Frederick, my eldest son, you see, who will perhaps inherit as
considerable a landed property as any private man in the county, has his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
profession.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The imposing effect of this last argument was equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wishes. The
silence of the lady proved it to be unanswerable.

<p/>Something had been said the evening before of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being shown over the
house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) now offered himself as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conductor; and though Catherine
had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) daughter, it was a
proposal of too much happiness in itself, under any circumstances, not
to be gladly accepted; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been already eighteen hours in the
abbey, and had seen only a few of its rooms. The netting-box, just
leisurely drawn forth, was closed with joyful haste, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ready
to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in a moment. <div class="bookquote">``And when they had gone over the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) into the
shrubberies and garden.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) curtsied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquiescence. <div class="bookquote">``But perhaps
it might be more agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to make those her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) first object.
The weather was at present favourable, and at this time of year the
uncertainty was very great of its continuing so. Which would she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) prefer?
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was equally at her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) service. Which did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter think would most
accord with her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) fair friend's wishes? But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could discern.
Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly read in Miss Morland's eyes a judicious desire of
making use of the present smiling weather. But when did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) judge amiss?
The abbey would be always safe and dry. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yielded implicitly, and
would fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat and attend them in a moment.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) left the room,
and Catherine, with a disappointed, anxious face, began to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
unwillingness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should be taking them out of doors against his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
inclination, under a mistaken idea of pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was stopped
by Miss Tilney's saying, with a little confusion, <div class="bookquote">``I believe it will be
wisest to take the morning while it is so fine; and do not be uneasy on
my father's account; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always walks out at this time of day.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood. Why
was Miss Tilney embarrassed? Could there be any unwillingness on the
general's side to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) over the abbey? The proposal was his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own. And
was not it odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) should always take his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) walk so early? Neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
father nor Mr. Allen did so. It was certainly very provoking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was
all impatience to see the house, and had scarcely any curiosity about
the grounds. If Henry had been with them indeed! But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) should not
know what was picturesque when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) saw it. Such were her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thoughts, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) kept them to herself, and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) bonnet in patient discontent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was struck, however, beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) expectation, by the grandeur of
the abbey, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) saw it for the first time from the lawn. The whole
building enclosed a large court; and two sides of the quadrangle, rich
in Gothic ornaments, stood forward for admiration. The remainder was
shut off by knolls of old trees, or luxuriant plantations, and the steep
woody hills rising behind, to give it shelter, were beautiful even in
the leafless month of March. Catherine had seen nothing to compare with
it; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings of delight were so strong, that without waiting for
any better authority, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) boldly burst forth in wonder and praise. The
general listened with assenting gratitude; and it seemed as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
estimation of Northanger had waited unfixed till that hour.

<p/>The kitchen-garden was to be next admired, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) led the way to it
across a small portion of the park.

<p/>The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could
not listen to without dismay, being more than double the extent of all
Mr. Allen's, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father's, including church-yard and orchard.
The walls seemed countless in number, endless in length; a village of
hot-houses seemed to arise among them, and a whole parish to be at
work within the enclosure. The general was flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looks of
surprise, which told him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) almost as plainly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) soon forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) in words, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never seen any gardens at all equal to
them before; and he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) then modestly owned that, <div class="bookquote">``without any ambition of
that sort himself--without any solicitude about it--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did believe them
to be unrivalled in the kingdom. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a hobby-horse, it was that.
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loved a garden. Though careless enough in most matters of eating, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
loved good fruit--or if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends and children did. There
were great vexations, however, attending such a garden as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The
utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits. The pinery
had yielded only one hundred in the last year. Mr. Allen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) supposed,
must feel these inconveniences as well as himself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not at all. Mr. Allen did not care about the garden, and never went
into it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a triumphant smile of self-satisfaction, the general wished he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
could do the same, for he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>), without being vexed in some
way or other, by its falling short of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) plan.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How were Mr. Allen's succession-houses worked?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>describing the nature
of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own as they entered them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Allen had only one small hot-house, which Mrs. Allen had the use of
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) plants in winter, and there was a fire in it now and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is a happy man!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the general, with a look of very happy
contempt.

<p/>Having taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) into every division, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) under every wall, till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was heartily weary of seeing and wondering, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) suffered the girls
at last to seize the advantage of an outer door, and then expressing
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) wish to examine the effect of some recent alterations about the
tea-house, proposed it as no unpleasant extension of their walk, if Miss
Morland were not tired. <div class="bookquote">``But where are you going, Eleanor? Why do you
choose that cold, damp path to it? Miss Morland will get wet. Our best
way is across the park.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is so favourite a walk of mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, <div class="bookquote">``that I always
think it the best and nearest way. But perhaps it may be damp.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs;
and Catherine, struck by its gloomy aspect, and eager to enter it,
could not, even by the general's disapprobation, be kept from stepping
forward. He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inclination, and having again urged the plea
of health in vain, was too polite to make further opposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) excused
himself, however, from attending them: <div class="bookquote">``The rays of the sun were not too
cheerful for him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would meet them by another course.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) turned
away; and Catherine was shocked to find how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits were
relieved by the separation. The shock, however, being less real than the
relief, offered it no injury; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to talk with easy gaiety of
the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am particularly fond of this spot,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion, with a sigh.
<div class="bookquote">``It was my mother's favourite walk.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine had never heard Mrs. Tilney mentioned in the family before,
and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself
directly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) altered countenance, and in the attentive pause with
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) waited for something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to walk here so often with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>added Eleanor; <div class="bookquote">``though I never
loved it then, as I have loved it since. At that time indeed I used to
wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) choice. But her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) memory endears it now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And ought it not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>reflected Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``to endear it to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband?
Yet the general would not enter it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Miss Tilney continuing silent, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
ventured to say, <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death must have been a great affliction!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A great and increasing one,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other, in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``I was
only thirteen when it happened; and though I felt my loss perhaps as
strongly as one so young could feel it, I did not, I could not, then
know what a loss it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) stopped for a moment, and then added, with
great firmness, <div class="bookquote">``I have no sister, you know--and though Henry--though my
brothers are very affectionate, and Henry is a great deal here, which I
am most thankful for, it is impossible for me not to be often solitary.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To be sure you must miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) very much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A mother would have been always present. A mother would have been a
constant friend; her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) influence would have been beyond all other.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a very charming woman? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) handsome? Was there any picture
of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in the abbey? And why had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been so partial to that grove? Was
it from dejection of spirits?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--were questions now eagerly poured forth;
the first three received a ready affirmative, the two others were passed
by; and Catherine's interest in the deceased Mrs. Tilney augmented with
every question, whether answered or not. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) unhappiness in marriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt persuaded. The general certainly had been an unkind husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
did not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) walk: could he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) therefore have loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)? And besides,
handsome as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was, there was a something in the turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) features
which spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) not having behaved well to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) picture, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>blushing at the consummate art of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own
question, <div class="bookquote">``hangs in your father's room?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No; it was intended for the drawing-room; but my father was
dissatisfied with the painting, and for some time it had no place.
Soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death I obtained it for my own, and hung it in my
bed-chamber--where I shall be happy to show it you; it is very like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here was another proof. A portrait--very like--of a departed wife, not
valued by the husband! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must have been dreadfully cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!

<p/>Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the
feelings which, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attentions, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had previously
excited; and what had been terror and dislike before, was now absolute
aversion. Yes, aversion! His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cruelty to such a charming woman made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had often read of such characters, characters which
Mr. Allen had been used to call unnatural and overdrawn; but here was
proof positive of the contrary.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had just settled this point when the end of the path brought them
directly upon the general; and in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) virtuous indignation,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) found herself again obliged to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), and
even to smile when he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) smiled. Being no longer able, however, to receive
pleasure from the surrounding objects, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon began to walk with
lassitude; the general perceived it, and with a concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) health,
which seemed to reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), was most urgent
for returning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) daughter to the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would follow them in
a quarter of an hour. Again they parted--but Eleanor was called back in
half a minute to receive a strict charge against taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) friend round
the abbey till his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return. This second instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) anxiety to delay
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable.




<p/>CHAPTER 23


<p/>An hour passed away before the general came in, spent, on the part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) young guest, in no very favourable consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) character.
<div class="bookquote">``This lengthened absence, these solitary rambles, did not speak a mind
at ease, or a conscience void of reproach.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) appeared; and,
whatever might have been the gloom of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) meditations, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) could still
smile with them. Miss Tilney, understanding in part her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) friend's
curiosity to see the house, soon revived the subject; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father
being, contrary to Catherine's expectations, unprovided with any
pretence for further delay, beyond that of stopping five minutes to
order refreshments to be in the room by their return, was at last ready
to escort them.

<p/>They set forward; and, with a grandeur of air, a dignified step,
which caught the eye, but could not shake the doubts of the well-read
Catherine, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) led the way across the hall, through the common
drawing-room and one useless antechamber, into a room magnificent both
in size and furniture--the real drawing-room, used only with company of
consequence. It was very noble--very grand--very charming!--was all that
Catherine had to say, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) indiscriminating eye scarcely discerned
the colour of the satin; and all minuteness of praise, all praise
that had much meaning, was supplied by the general: the costliness or
elegance of any room's fitting-up could be nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cared for
no furniture of a more modern date than the fifteenth century. When the
general had satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own curiosity, in a close examination of every
well-known ornament, they proceeded into the library, an apartment, in
its way, of equal magnificence, exhibiting a collection of books, on
which an humble man might have looked with pride. Catherine heard,
admired, and wondered with more genuine feeling than before--gathered
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could from this storehouse of knowledge, by running over
the titles of half a shelf, and was ready to proceed. But suites of
apartments did not spring up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wishes. Large as was the building,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had already visited the greatest part; though, on being told that,
with the addition of the kitchen, the six or seven rooms she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had now
seen surrounded three sides of the court, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could scarcely believe it,
or overcome the suspicion of there being many chambers secreted. It was
some relief, however, that they were to return to the rooms in common
use, by passing through a few of less importance, looking into the
court, which, with occasional passages, not wholly unintricate,
connected the different sides; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was further soothed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
progress by being told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was treading what had once been a
cloister, having traces of cells pointed out, and observing several
doors that were neither opened nor explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)--by finding herself
successively in a billiard-room, and in the general's private apartment,
without comprehending their connection, or being able to turn aright
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) left them; and lastly, by passing through a dark little room,
owning Henry's authority, and strewed with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) litter of books, guns,
and greatcoats.

<p/>From the dining-room, of which, though already seen, and always to be
seen at five o’clock, the general could not forgo the pleasure of pacing
out the length, for the more certain information of Miss Morland, as
to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) neither doubted nor cared for, they proceeded by quick
communication to the kitchen--the ancient kitchen of the convent, rich
in the massy walls and smoke of former days, and in the stoves and hot
closets of the present. The general's improving hand had not loitered
here: every modern invention to facilitate the labour of the cooks had
been adopted within this, their spacious theatre; and, when the genius
of others had failed, his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) own had often produced the perfection wanted.
His (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) endowments of this spot alone might at any time have placed him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) high
among the benefactors of the convent.

<p/>With the walls of the kitchen ended all the antiquity of the abbey; the
fourth side of the quadrangle having, on account of its decaying state,
been removed by the general's father, and the present erected in its
place. All that was venerable ceased here. The new building was not
only new, but declared itself to be so; intended only for offices, and
enclosed behind by stable-yards, no uniformity of architecture had been
thought necessary. Catherine could have raved at the hand which had
swept away what must have been beyond the value of all the rest, for the
purposes of mere domestic economy; and would willingly have been spared
the mortification of a walk through scenes so fallen, had the general
allowed it; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a vanity, it was in the arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
offices; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was convinced that, to a mind like Miss Morland's,
a view of the accommodations and comforts, by which the labours of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
inferiors were softened, must always be gratifying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should make
no apology for leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) on. They took a slight survey of all; and
Catherine was impressed, beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expectation, by their multiplicity
and their convenience. The purposes for which a few shapeless pantries
and a comfortless scullery were deemed sufficient at Fullerton, were
here carried on in appropriate divisions, commodious and roomy. The
number of servants continually appearing did not strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) less than
the number of their offices. Wherever they went, some pattened girl
stopped to curtsy, or some footman in dishabille sneaked off. Yet this
was an abbey! How inexpressibly different in these domestic arrangements
from such as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had read about--from abbeys and castles, in which,
though certainly larger than Northanger, all the dirty work of the house
was to be done by two pair of female hands at the utmost. How they could
get through it all had often amazed Mrs. Allen; and, when Catherine saw
what was necessary here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began to be amazed herself.

<p/>They returned to the hall, that the chief staircase might be ascended,
and the beauty of its wood, and ornaments of rich carving might be
pointed out: having gained the top, they turned in an opposite direction
from the gallery in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room lay, and shortly entered one on
the same plan, but superior in length and breadth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was here shown
successively into three large bed-chambers, with their dressing-rooms,
most completely and handsomely fitted up; everything that money and
taste could do, to give comfort and elegance to apartments, had been
bestowed on these; and, being furnished within the last five years, they
were perfect in all that would be generally pleasing, and wanting in all
that could give pleasure to Catherine. As they were surveying the last,
the general, after slightly naming a few of the distinguished characters
by whom they had at times been honoured, turned with a smiling
countenance to Catherine, and ventured to hope that henceforward some of
their earliest tenants might be <div class="bookquote">``our friends from Fullerton.''  (<font color='red'><b>tenants</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt
the unexpected compliment, and deeply regretted the impossibility of
thinking well of a man so kindly disposed towards herself, and so full
of civility to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) family.

<p/>The gallery was terminated by folding doors, which Miss Tilney,
advancing, had thrown open, and passed through, and seemed on the point
of doing the same by the first door to the left, in another long reach
of gallery, when the general, coming forwards, called her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hastily, and,
as Catherine thought, rather angrily back, demanding whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) were
going?--And what was there more to be seen?--Had not Miss Morland
already seen all that could be worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) notice?--And did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) not
suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) friend might be glad of some refreshment after so much
exercise? Miss Tilney drew back directly, and the heavy doors were
closed upon the mortified Catherine, who, having seen, in a momentary
glance beyond them, a narrower passage, more numerous openings, and
symptoms of a winding staircase, believed herself at last within the
reach of something worth her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice; and felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) unwillingly paced
back the gallery, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would rather be allowed to examine that end
of the house than see all the finery of all the rest. The general's
evident desire of preventing such an examination was an additional
stimulant. Something was certainly to be concealed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fancy, though
it had trespassed lately once or twice, could not mislead her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) here;
and what that something was, a short sentence of Miss Tilney's, as they
followed the general at some distance downstairs, seemed to point out:
<div class="bookquote">``I was going to take you into what was my mother's room--the room
in which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died--''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) words; but few as they were, they
conveyed pages of intelligence to Catherine. It was no wonder that the
general should shrink from the sight of such objects as that room
must contain; a room in all probability never entered by him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) since the
dreadful scene had passed, which released his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suffering wife, and left
him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to the stings of conscience.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ventured, when next alone with Eleanor, to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) wish of being
permitted to see it, as well as all the rest of that side of the house;
and Eleanor promised to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) there, whenever they should have a
convenient hour. Catherine understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>): the general must be watched
from home, before that room could be entered. <div class="bookquote">``It remains as it was, I
suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), in a tone of feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, entirely.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And how long ago may it be that your mother died?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been dead these nine years.''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>And nine years, Catherine knew,
was a trifle of time, compared with what generally elapsed after the
death of an injured wife, before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room was put to rights.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I suppose, to the last?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Miss Tilney, sighing; <div class="bookquote">``I was unfortunately from home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
illness was sudden and short; and, before I arrived it was all over.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's blood ran cold with the horrid suggestions which naturally
sprang from these words. Could it be possible? Could Henry's father--?
And yet how many were the examples to justify even the blackest
suspicions! And, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in the evening, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) worked
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) friend, slowly pacing the drawing-room for an hour together in
silent thoughtfulness, with downcast eyes and contracted brow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt
secure from all possibility of wronging him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). It was the air and attitude
of a Montoni! What could more plainly speak the gloomy workings of a
mind not wholly dead to every sense of humanity, in its fearful review
of past scenes of guilt? Unhappy man! And the anxiousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spirits
directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes towards his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) figure so repeatedly, as to catch Miss
Tilney's notice. <div class="bookquote">``My father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``often walks about the room
in this way; it is nothing unusual.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So much the worse!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>thought Catherine; such ill-timed exercise was of a
piece with the strange unseasonableness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) morning walks, and boded
nothing good.

<p/>After an evening, the little variety and seeming length of which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) peculiarly sensible of Henry's importance among them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
heartily glad to be dismissed; though it was a look from the general not
designed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observation which sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) daughter to the bell.
When the butler would have lit his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) master's candle, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was
forbidden. The latter was not going to retire. <div class="bookquote">``I have many pamphlets to
finish,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) to Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``before I can close my eyes, and perhaps
may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are
asleep. Can either of us be more meetly employed? My eyes will be
blinding for the good of others, and yours preparing by rest for future
mischief.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>But neither the business alleged, nor the magnificent compliment,
could win Catherine from thinking that some very different object must
occasion so serious a delay of proper repose. To be kept up for hours,
after the family were in bed, by stupid pamphlets was not very likely.
There must be some deeper cause: something was to be done which could
be done only while the household slept; and the probability that Mrs.
Tilney yet lived, shut up for causes unknown, and receiving from the
pitiless hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) husband a nightly supply of coarse food, was the
conclusion which necessarily followed. Shocking as was the idea, it
was at least better than a death unfairly hastened, as, in the natural
course of things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must ere long be released. The suddenness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
reputed illness, the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) daughter, and probably of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) other
children, at the time--all favoured the supposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) imprisonment.
Its origin--jealousy perhaps, or wanton cruelty--was yet to be
unravelled.

<p/>In revolving these matters, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) undressed, it suddenly struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
as not unlikely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might that morning have passed near the very
spot of this unfortunate woman's confinement--might have been within
a few paces of the cell in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) languished out her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) days; for what
part of the abbey could be more fitted for the purpose than that which
yet bore the traces of monastic division? In the high-arched passage,
paved with stone, which already she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had trodden with peculiar awe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
well remembered the doors of which the general had given no account. To
what might not those doors lead? In support of the plausibility of this
conjecture, it further occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) that the forbidden gallery, in
which lay the apartments of the unfortunate Mrs. Tilney, must be, as
certainly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) memory could guide her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), exactly over this suspected
range of cells, and the staircase by the side of those apartments of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had caught a transient glimpse, communicating by some
secret means with those cells, might well have favoured the barbarous
proceedings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) husband. Down that staircase she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had perhaps been
conveyed in a state of well-prepared insensibility!

<p/>Catherine sometimes started at the boldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own surmises, and
sometimes hoped or feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had gone too far; but they were
supported by such appearances as made their dismissal impossible.

<p/>The side of the quadrangle, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) supposed the guilty scene to be
acting, being, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) belief, just opposite her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, it struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) that, if judiciously watched, some rays of light from the general's
lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) passed to the prison
of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) wife; and, twice before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stepped into bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stole gently
from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it
appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. The
various ascending noises convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that the servants must still be
up. Till midnight, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then,
when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would, if not
quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clock
struck twelve--and Catherine had been half an hour asleep.




<p/>CHAPTER 24


<p/>The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of the
mysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between morning
and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or
eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine's curiosity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner, either
by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o’clock, or by the
yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp.
The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination
beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs.
Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eye
was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of the highly
strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) by the
inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
destroyer, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) even to tears.

<p/>That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to face
it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could sit so boldly
collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so
fearlessly around, nay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should even enter the church, seemed
wonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings
equally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could remember
dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime to
crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of humanity
or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their
black career. The erection of the monument itself could not in the
smallest degree affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doubts of Mrs. Tilney's actual decease. Were
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even to descend into the family vault where her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ashes were supposed
to slumber, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to behold the coffin in which they were said to
be enclosed--what could it avail in such a case? Catherine had read too
much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure
might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried on.

<p/>The succeeding morning promised something better. The general's early
walk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) to be out of the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly proposed to Miss
Tilney the accomplishment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); and Catherine reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as they went of another promise, their
first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bed-chamber. It
represented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,
justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were
not in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting
with features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,
the very image, if not of Henry's, of Eleanor's--the only portraits of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal
resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for
generations. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was obliged to look and consider and study
for a likeness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contemplated it, however, in spite of this drawback,
with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest, would have left
it unwillingly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any
endeavour at discourse; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companion. Eleanor's
countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) inured
to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed
through the folding doors, again her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand was upon the important lock,
and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to close the former
with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded figure of the general
himself at the further end of the gallery, stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)! The name of
<div class="bookquote">``Eleanor''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter intimation</b></font>)</div>at the same moment, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) loudest tone, resounded through the
building, giving to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter the first intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence,
and to Catherine terror upon terror. An attempt at concealment had been
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first instinctive movement on perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
scarcely hope to have escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eye; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, who with an
apologizing look darted hastily by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), had joined and disappeared
with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ran for safety to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own room, and, locking herself
in, believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should never have courage to go down again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
remained there at least an hour, in the greatest agitation, deeply
commiserating the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) poor friend, and expecting a summons
herself from the angry general to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own apartment. No
summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing a carriage drive up
to the abbey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was emboldened to descend and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) under the
protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay with company; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was named to them by the general as the friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) daughter, in
a complimentary style, which so well concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) resentful ire, as to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel secure at least of life for the present. And Eleanor,
with a command of countenance which did honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
character, taking an early occasion of saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``My father only
wanted me to answer a note,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) began to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had either been
unseen by the general, or that from some consideration of policy she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
should be allowed to suppose herself so. Upon this trust she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) dared still
to remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) presence, after the company left them, and nothing
occurred to disturb it.

<p/>In the course of this morning's reflections, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) came to a resolution
of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be much
better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the matter.
To involve her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) in the danger of a second detection, to court her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) into
an apartment which must wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) heart, could not be the office of a
friend. The general's utmost anger could not be to herself what it might
be to a daughter; and, besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought the examination itself
would be more satisfactory if made without any companion. It would be
impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions, from which the other
had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily exempt; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
therefore, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) presence, search for those proofs of the general's
cruelty, which however they might yet have escaped discovery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt
confident of somewhere drawing forth, in the shape of some fragmented
journal, continued to the last gasp. Of the way to the apartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was
now perfectly mistress; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) wished to get it over before Henry's
return, who was expected on the morrow, there was no time to be lost.
The day was bright, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) courage high; at four o’clock, the sun was now
two hours above the horizon, and it would be only her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) retiring to dress
half an hour earlier than usual.

<p/>It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the
clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried
on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors,
and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the one in
question. The lock yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, and, luckily, with no sullen
sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered; the room
was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but it was some minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could advance another
step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beheld what fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to the spot and agitated every feature.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome dimity bed,
arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid's care, a bright Bath stove,
mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the warm beams
of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows! Catherine had
expected to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings worked, and worked they were. Astonishment
and doubt first seized them; and a shortly succeeding ray of common
sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not be mistaken
as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in everything else!--in Miss
Tilney's meaning, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own calculation! This apartment, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
had given a date so ancient, a position so awful, proved to be one end
of what the general's father had built. There were two other doors in
the chamber, leading probably into dressing-closets; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had no
inclination to open either. Would the veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last
walked, or the volume in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had last read, remain to tell what
nothing else was allowed to whisper? No: whatever might have been the
general's crimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had certainly too much wit to let them sue for
detection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was sick of exploring, and desired but to be safe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
own room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own heart only privy to its folly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was on
the point of retreating as softly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had entered, when the sound of
footsteps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could hardly tell where, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pause and tremble.
To be found there, even by a servant, would be unpleasant; but by the
general -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) seemed always at hand when least wanted-RRB-, much worse!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) listened--the sound had ceased; and resolving not to lose a
moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) passed through and closed the door. At that instant a door
underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed with swift steps to ascend
the stairs, by the head of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had yet to pass before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could
gain the gallery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had no power to move. With a feeling of terror
not very definable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes on the staircase, and in a few
moments it gave Henry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) view. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Tilney!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) exclaimed in a
voice of more than common astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked astonished too. <div class="bookquote">``Good
God!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) continued, not attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) address. <div class="bookquote">``How came you here?
How came you up that staircase?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How came I up that staircase!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, greatly surprised. <div class="bookquote">``Because
it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why
should I not come up it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
seemed to be looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) countenance for that explanation which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
lips did not afford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved on towards the gallery. <div class="bookquote">``And may I not,
in my turn,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pushed back the folding doors, <div class="bookquote">``ask how you
came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the
breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be from the
stables to mine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, looking down, <div class="bookquote">``to see your mother's
room.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My mother's room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till
tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but
three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You
look pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs.
Perhaps you did not know--you were not aware of their leading from the
offices in common use?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in
the house by yourself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) showed me over the greatest part on Saturday--and we were
coming here to these rooms--but only'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) voice--<div class="bookquote">``your father
was with us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And that prevented you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, earnestly regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Have you
looked into all the rooms in that passage?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I only wanted to see--Is not it very late? I must go and dress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only a quarter past four''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) watch--<div class="bookquote">``and you are not now
in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at Northanger
must be enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be
detained, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dread of further questions made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), for the first
time in their acquaintance, wish to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). They walked slowly up the
gallery. <div class="bookquote">``Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to
write directly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have
heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise--the fidelity
of promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can
deceive and pain you. My mother's room is very commodious, is it not?
Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!
It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house, and
I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sent
you to look at it, I suppose?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been your own doing entirely?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine said nothing. After a
short silence, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had closely observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``As
there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must
have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother's character,
as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) memory. The world, I
believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can
boast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a
person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating
tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,
has talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) a great deal?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a great deal. That is--no, not much, but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did say was very
interesting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) dying so suddenly''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-slowly, and with hesitation it
was spoken-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``and you--none of you being at home--and your father, I

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And from these circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) replied -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) quick eye

something still less pardonable.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes towards him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
more fully than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ever done before. <div class="bookquote">``My mother's illness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
continued, <div class="bookquote">``the seizure which ended in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, was sudden. The malady
itself, one from which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had often suffered, a bilious fever--its
cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short, as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could be prevailed on, a physician attended her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), a very respectable
man, and one in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had always placed great confidence. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>)
opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) danger, two others were called in the next day, and
remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours. On the
fifth day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died. During the progress of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) disorder, Frederick and I
-LRB-we were both at home-RRB- saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) repeatedly; and from our own observation
can bear witness to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) having received every possible attention
which could spring from the affection of those about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), or which her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor was absent, and at such a
distance as to return only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) coffin.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But your father,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) afflicted?''

to--we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of disposition--and
I will not pretend to say that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might not often have
had much to bear, but though his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) temper injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) judgment never
did. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was sincere; and, if not permanently, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was truly
afflicted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) death.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; <div class="bookquote">``it would have been very

Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are
English, that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your
own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing
around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our
laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated without being known, in
a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a
footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary
spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss
Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>They had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ran
off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own room.




<p/>CHAPTER 25


<p/>The visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened.
Henry's address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes to the extravagance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) late fancies than all their several
disappointments had done. Most grievously was she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) humbled. Most bitterly
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cry. It was not only with herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sunk--but with
Henry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all exposed to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forever. The liberty which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination
had dared to take with the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father--could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ever
forgive it? The absurdity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) curiosity and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears--could they
ever be forgotten? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hated herself more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could express. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
had--she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had, once or twice before this fatal morning, shown
something like affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But now--in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made herself as
miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when the
clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an
intelligible answer to Eleanor's inquiry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was well. The formidable
Henry soon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) into the room, and the only difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) rather more attention than usual.
Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was
aware of it.

<p/>The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not
learn either to forget or defend the past; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learned to hope that
it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) Henry's
entire regard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly be
clearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created delusion,
each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an imagination
resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one purpose by
a mind which, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the abbey, had been craving to be
frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remembered with what feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had prepared for a
knowledge of Northanger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw that the infatuation had been created,
the mischief settled, long before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quitting Bath, and it seemed as if
the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of reading which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had there indulged.

<p/>Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe's works, and charming even as were
the works of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Radcliffe</b></font>) imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human
nature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked
for. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,
they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and
the south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there
represented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own country, and even
of that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western
extremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some
security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of
the land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated, servants
were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be procured,
like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and Pyrenees, perhaps,
there were no mixed characters. There, such as were not as spotless as
an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But in England it was
not so; among the English, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed, in their hearts and habits,
there was a general though unequal mixture of good and bad. Upon this
conviction, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not be surprised if even in Henry and Eleanor
Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter appear; and upon this
conviction she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) need not fear to acknowledge some actual specks in
the character of their father, who, though cleared from the grossly
injurious suspicions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must ever blush to have entertained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not perfectly amiable.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mind made up on these several points, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) resolution formed, of
always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and
the lenient hand of time did much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) by insensible gradations in
the course of another day. Henry's astonishing generosity and nobleness
of conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,
was of the greatest assistance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); and sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could have
supposed it possible in the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) distress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spirits
became absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual
improvement by anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. There were still some subjects, indeed,
under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) believed they must always tremble--the mention of a
chest or a cabinet, for instance--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) did not love the sight of
japan in any shape: but even she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could allow that an occasional memento
of past folly, however painful, might not be without use.

<p/>The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of
romance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the
rooms were attended; and especially was she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) anxious to be assured of
Isabella's having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) intent; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) continuing on the best terms with James. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James had
protested against writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) till his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) return to Oxford; and Mrs.
Allen had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) no hopes of a letter till she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had got back to
Fullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
promised a thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was so scrupulous in performing it! This made it
so particularly strange!

<p/>For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition
of a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on
the tenth, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the breakfast-room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first object was a
letter, held out by Henry's willing hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as heartily
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had written it himself. ```Tis only from James, however,'' as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
looked at the direction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opened it; it was from Oxford; and to this
purpose:


<p/>``Dear Catherine,

<p/>``Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it my
duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss Thorpe and
me. I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) and Bath yesterday, never to see either again. I shall
not enter into particulars--they would only pain you more. You will soon
hear enough from another quarter to know where lies the blame; and I
hope will acquit your brother of everything but the folly of too easily
thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) affection returned. Thank God! I am undeceived in time!
But it is a heavy blow! After my father's consent had been so kindly
given--but no more of this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) has made me miserable forever! Let me
soon hear from you, dear Catherine; you are my only friend; your love
I do build upon. I wish your visit at Northanger may be over before
Captain Tilney makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably
circumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
honest heart would feel so much. I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) and my father.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last, if I reasoned
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) declared herself as much attached to me as ever, and
laughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I bore with it;
but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved, I was that man. I
cannot understand even now what she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) would be at, for there could be no
need of my being played off to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) secure of Tilney. We parted
at last by mutual consent--happy for me had we never met! I can never
expect to know such another woman! Dearest Catherine, beware how you
give your heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Believe me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>&c.


<p/>Catherine had not read three lines before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sudden change of
countenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) through
the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it began. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
was prevented, however, from even looking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) surprise by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's
entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could hardly
eat anything. Tears filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes, and even ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
sat. The letter was one moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lap, and then in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pocket; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did. The general,
between his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cocoa and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) newspaper, had luckily no leisure for noticing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but to the other two her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress was equally visible. As soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared leave the table she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own room; but the
housemaids were busy in it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was obliged to come down again.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but Henry and Eleanor had
likewise retreated thither, and were at that moment deep in consultation
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) drew back, trying to beg their pardon, but was, with
gentle violence, forced to return; and the others withdrew, after
Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of being of use or comfort
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>).

<p/>After half an hour's free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine
felt equal to encountering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends; but whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if
particularly questioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might just give an idea--just distantly
hint at it--but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella
had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)--and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor
were by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) entered it,
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) anxiously. Catherine took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place at the table, and,
after a short silence, Eleanor said, <div class="bookquote">``No bad news from Fullerton, I
hope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland--your brothers and sisters--I hope they are
none of them ill?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-sighing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) spoke-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``they are all very well. My
letter was from my brother at Oxford.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter
again!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, closing the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had just opened; <div class="bookquote">``if I
had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should have
given it with very different feelings.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James is
so unhappy! You will soon know why.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>replied Henry
warmly, <div class="bookquote">``must be a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) under any distress.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have one favour to beg,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an
agitated manner, <div class="bookquote">``that, if your brother should be coming here, you will
give me notice of it, that I may go away.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Our brother! Frederick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but
something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in
the same house with Captain Tilney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor's work was suspended while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) gazed with increasing
astonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in
which Miss Thorpe's name was included, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lips.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``How quick you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine: <div class="bookquote">``you have guessed it, I declare!
And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its
ending so. Isabella--no wonder now I have not heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)--Isabella
has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed
there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is
bad in the world?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland's
disappointment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you
must be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland--sorry that
anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at
Frederick's marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) than at any other part of the story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very true, however; you shall read James's letter yourself.
Stay--There is one part--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>recollecting with a blush the last line.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern
my brother?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, read it yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were
clearer. <div class="bookquote">``I do not know what I was thinking of''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-blushing again that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had blushed before-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``James only means to give me good advice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with close
attention, returned it saying, <div class="bookquote">``Well, if it is to be so, I can only
say that I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who has
chosen a wife with less sense than his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) family expected. I do not envy
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) situation, either as a lover or a son.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Tilney, at Catherine's invitation, now read the letter likewise,
and, having expressed also her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) concern and surprise, began to inquire
into Miss Thorpe's connections and fortune.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother is a very good sort of woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>was Catherine's answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they a wealthy family?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but
that will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal!
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me the other day that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only valued money as it allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
promote the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children.''  (<font color='red'><b>The brother sister</b></font>)</div>The brother and sister looked
at each other. <div class="bookquote">``But,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor, after a short pause, <div class="bookquote">``would it be to
promote his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) happiness, to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to marry such a girl? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must be
an unprincipled one, or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not have used your brother so. And how
strange an infatuation on Frederick's side! A girl who, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) eyes,
is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man! Is
not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) heart so
proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>). When I think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) past declarations, I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) up.
Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe's prudence to
suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) would part with one gentleman before the other
was secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) is a deceased
man--defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor,
and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless,
guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,
and knowing no disguise.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor with a
smile.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>observed Catherine, <div class="bookquote">``though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) has behaved so ill by our
family, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) may behave better by yours. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) has really got the man
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) likes, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) may be constant.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) will,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>replied Henry; <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) will
be very constant, unless a baronet should come in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) way; that is
Frederick's only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the
arrivals.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are
some things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) first
knew what my father would do for them, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) seemed quite disappointed
that it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone's character in
my life before.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Among all the great variety that you have known and studied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My own disappointment and loss in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) is very great; but, as for poor
James, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will hardly ever recover it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we
must not, in our concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sufferings, undervalue yours. You feel,
I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you feel a
void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is becoming
irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to share at
Bath, the very idea of them without her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is abhorrent. You would not,
for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that you have no
longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on whose regard
you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any difficulty, you could
rely on. You feel all this?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, after a few moments' reflection, <div class="bookquote">``I do not--ought
I? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), that I am never to hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), perhaps never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have
thought.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human nature.
Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine, by some chance or other, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits so very much
relieved by this conversation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being led
on, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had
produced it.




<p/>CHAPTER 26


<p/>From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young
people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) two young
friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella's want of
consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general would,
upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be
raised against her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) character, oppose the connection, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) feelings
moreover with some alarm towards herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was as insignificant,
and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney
property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point
of interest were the demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) younger brother to rest? The very
painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by
a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
was given to understand by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) words as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) actions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had
from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a
recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the
subject of money, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had more than once heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) utter, and
which tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) disposition in such matters misunderstood
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) children.

<p/>They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not
have the courage to apply in person for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father's consent, and so
repeatedly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life been less likely to
come to Northanger than at the present time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) mind
to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own. But
as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
application, would give his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father any just idea of Isabella's conduct,
it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole
business before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as it really was, enabling the general by that means
to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) objections on
a fairer ground than inequality of situations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) proposed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
accordingly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had
expected. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``my father's hands need not be strengthened,
and Frederick's confession of folly need not be forestalled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) must
tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) own story.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) will tell only half of it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A quarter would be enough.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div><p/>A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
brother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to
them as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) silence would be the natural result of the suspected
engagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it.
The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick's
remissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>), and had
no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland's time at
Northanger pass pleasantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) often expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) uneasiness on this
head, feared the sameness of every day's society and employments would
disgust her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the
country, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner,
and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing
people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year,
no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country.
And it all ended, at last, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) telling Henry one morning that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
next went to Woodston, they would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) by surprise there some day
or other, and eat their mutton with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>). Henry was greatly honoured and
very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. <div class="bookquote">``And when
do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at
Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be
obliged to stay two or three days.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There is
no need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way.
Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I
can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor's table.
Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on
Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor
from Brockham with his (<font color='blue'><b>surveyor</b></font>) report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in
decency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintance
if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would
be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland,
never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of
time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men.
They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them
whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question.
But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be
with you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours and
three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the
carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may
look for us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than
this little excursion, so strong was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) desire to be acquainted with
Woodston; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an
hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
and Eleanor were sitting, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I am come, young ladies, in a
very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world
are always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great
disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the
future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour.
Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on
Wednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I
must go away directly, two days before I intended it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with a very long face. <div class="bookquote">``And why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in
frightening my old housekeeper out of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) wits, because I must go and
prepare a dinner for you, to be sure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Not seriously!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, and sadly too--for I had much rather stay.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said?
When he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble,
because anything would do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry only smiled. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister's
account and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made such
a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had not
said half so much as he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) has always such an excellent dinner
at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not
signify.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could reason like you, for his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) sake and my own. Good-bye. As
tomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine
to doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own judgment than Henry's, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very soon obliged to
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) credit for being right, however disagreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) going.
But the inexplicability of the general's conduct dwelt much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thoughts. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was very particular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eating, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
unassisted observation, already discovered; but why he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should say
one thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most
unaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who but
Henry could have been aware of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father was at?

<p/>From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry.
This was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney's letter
would certainly come in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) absence; and Wednesday she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very sure
would be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother so unhappy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor's
spirits always affected by Henry's absence! What was there to interest
or amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was tired of the woods and the shrubberies--always so
smooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) now than
any other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped
to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a
consideration of the building. What a revolution in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ideas! She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), who
had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected
parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had its
faults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come!

<p/>It did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. It
came--it was fine--and Catherine trod on air. By ten o’clock, the chaise
and four conveyed the trio from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive
of almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populous
village, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to say
how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought it, as the general seemed to think an apology
necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village;
but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) preferred it to any place she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ever been at,
and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of
a cottage, and at all the little chandler's shops which they passed. At
the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest
of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, with
its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to the
door, Henry, with the friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) solitude, a large Newfoundland
puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much of
them.

<p/>Catherine's mind was too full, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the house, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) either
to observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opinion of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had very little idea of the room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was sitting. Upon looking round it then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) perceived in a moment that
it was the most comfortable room in the world; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was too guarded
to say so, and the coldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) praise disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We are not calling it a good house,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We are not comparing
it with Fullerton and Northanger--we are considering it as a mere
parsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and
habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other
words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so
good. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say
otherwise; and anything in reason--a bow thrown out, perhaps--though,
between ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion,
it is a patched-on bow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained
by it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported
by Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was
introduced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) servant, the general was shortly restored to his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
complacency, and Catherine to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) usual ease of spirits.

<p/>The room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and
handsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it to
walk round the grounds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was shown, first into a smaller apartment,
belonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidy
on the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room,
with the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine was
delighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a prettily shaped
room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from them
pleasant, though only over green meadows; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
felt it. <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a pity
not to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is the
prettiest room in the world!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I trust,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the general, with a most satisfied smile, <div class="bookquote">``that it will
very speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady's taste!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a
sweet little cottage there is among the trees--apple trees, too! It is
the prettiest cottage!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You like it--you approve it as an object--it is enough. Henry, remember
that Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Such a compliment recalled all Catherine's consciousness, and silenced
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like
an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). The influence of
fresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating
these embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental part
of the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, on
which Henry's genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher than
the green bench in the corner.

<p/>A saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a
visit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game
of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them
to four o’clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. At
four they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never had
any day passed so quickly!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem
to create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
even looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
son and daughter's observations were of a different kind. They had
seldom seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eat so heartily at any table but his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, and never
before known him (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so little disconcerted by the melted butter's being
oiled.

<p/>At six o’clock, the general having taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) coffee, the carriage again
received them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) conduct
throughout the whole visit, so well assured was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind on the subject
of his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) expectations, that, could she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) have felt equally confident of the
wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little
anxiety as to the How or the When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might return to it.




<p/>CHAPTER 27


<p/>The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from
Isabella:


<p/>Bath, April

<p/>My dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest
delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them
sooner. I really am quite ashamed of my idleness; but in this horrid
place one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in my hand to
begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have
always been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to me
soon, and direct to my own home. Thank God, we leave this vile place
tomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no pleasure in it--the dust
is beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I believe if I
could see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to me than
anybody can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not
having heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to Oxford; and am fearful of some
misunderstanding. Your kind offices will set all right: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is the only
man I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of it.
The spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you
can imagine. I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you
never think of me. I will not say all that I could of the family you are
with, because I would not be ungenerous, or set you against those you
esteem; but it is very difficult to know whom to trust, and young men
never know their minds two days together. I rejoice to say that the
young man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. You
will know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as
you may remember, was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before
you went away. Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) got worse, and became quite my shadow. Many
girls might have been taken in, for never were such attentions; but I
knew the fickle sex too well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) went away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) regiment two days ago,
and I trust I shall never be plagued with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is the greatest
coxcomb I ever saw, and amazingly disagreeable. The last two days he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) taste, but took no
notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>). The last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned
directly into a shop that he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) might not speak to me; I would not even
look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) went into the pump-room afterwards; but I would not have
followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) for all the world. Such a contrast between him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) and your
brother! Pray send me some news of the latter--I am quite unhappy about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) seemed so uncomfortable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) went away, with a cold, or
something that affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) spirits. I would write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) myself, but
have mislaid his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) direction; and, as I hinted above, am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)
took something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>)
satisfaction; or, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Davis</b></font>) still harbours any doubt, a line from himself
to me, or a call at Putney when next in town, might set all to rights.
I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except going in
last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased
me into it; and I was determined they should not say I shut myself up
because Tilney was gone. We happened to sit by the Mitchells, and they
pretended to be quite surprised to see me out. I knew their spite: at
one time they could not be civil to me, but now they are all friendship;
but I am not such a fool as to be taken in by them. You know I have a
pretty good spirit of my own. Anne Mitchell had tried to put on a
turban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert, but made
wretched work of it--it happened to become my odd face, I believe, at
least Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is the last man whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple
now: I know I look hideous in it, but no matter--it is your dear
brother's favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest
Catherine, in writing to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and to me, Who ever am, etc..


<p/>Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine.
Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from the
very first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever
loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
excuses were empty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) demands impudent. <div class="bookquote">``Write to James on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
behalf! No, James should never hear Isabella's name mentioned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
again.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>On Henry's arrival from Woodston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and Eleanor
their brother's safety, congratulating them with sincerity on it, and
reading aloud the most material passages of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) letter with strong
indignation. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had finished it--<div class="bookquote">``So much for Isabella,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
cried, <div class="bookquote">``and for all our intimacy! She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) must think me an idiot, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
could not have written so; but perhaps this has served to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
character better known to me than mine is to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). I see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has
been about. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is a vain coquette, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tricks have not answered. I
do not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had ever any regard either for James or for me, and I
wish I had never known her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will soon be as if you never had,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is but one thing that I cannot understand. I see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has
had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not
understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) such attentions as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) quarrel with my brother, and
then fly off himself?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have very little to say for Frederick's motives, such as I believe
them to have been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) vanities as well as Miss Thorpe, and the
chief difference is, that, having a stronger head, they have not yet
injured himself. If the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) behaviour does not justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
with you, we had better not seek after the cause.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you do not suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) ever really cared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) never did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And only made believe to do so for mischief's sake?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Henry/Tilney/Mr. Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Henry bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) assent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, then, I must say that I do not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) at all. Though it has
turned out so well for us, I do not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) at all. As it happens,
there is no great harm done, because I do not think Isabella has any
heart to lose. But, suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) very much in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to
lose--consequently to have been a very different creature; and, in that
case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would have met with very different treatment.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very right that you should stand by your brother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And if you would stand by yours, you would not be much distressed by
the disappointment of Miss Thorpe. But your mind is warped by an innate
principle of general integrity, and therefore not accessible to the cool
reasonings of family partiality, or a desire of revenge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness. Frederick could
not be unpardonably guilty, while Henry made himself so agreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
resolved on not answering Isabella's letter, and tried to think no more
of it.




<p/>CHAPTER 28


<p/>Soon after this, the general found himself obliged to go to London for
a week; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) left Northanger earnestly regretting that any necessity
should rob him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) even for an hour of Miss Morland's company, and anxiously
recommending the study of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) comfort and amusement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) children
as their chief object in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) departure gave Catherine the
first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain. The
happiness with which their time now passed, every employment voluntary,
every laugh indulged, every meal a scene of ease and good humour,
walking where they liked and when they liked, their hours, pleasures,
and fatigues at their own command, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoroughly sensible of the
restraint which the general's presence had imposed, and most thankfully
feel their present release from it. Such ease and such delights made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
love the place and the people more and more every day; and had it not
been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one, and
an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would at
each moment of each day have been perfectly happy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was now in
the fourth week of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visit; before the general came home, the fourth
week would be turned, and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
stayed much longer. This was a painful consideration whenever it
occurred; and eager to get rid of such a weight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very
soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once, propose going away,
and be guided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conduct by the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) proposal might
be taken.

<p/>Aware that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave herself much time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might feel it difficult to
bring forward so unpleasant a subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took the first opportunity of
being suddenly alone with Eleanor, and of Eleanor's being in the
middle of a speech about something very different, to start forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
obligation of going away very soon. Eleanor looked and declared herself
much concerned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``hoped for the pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) company for a
much longer time--had been misled -LRB-perhaps by her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) wishes-RRB- to suppose
that a much longer visit had been promised--and could not but think that
if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) there, they would be too generous to hasten her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) return.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Catherine
explained: <div class="bookquote">``Oh! As to that, Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all. As
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was happy, they would always be satisfied.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why, might she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) ask, in such a hurry herself to leave them?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had been there so long.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, if you can use such a word, I can urge you no farther. If you
think it long--''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! No, I do not indeed. For my own pleasure, I could stay with you as
long again.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And it was directly settled that, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) leaving
them was not even to be thought of. In having this cause of uneasiness
so pleasantly removed, the force of the other was likewise weakened. The
kindness, the earnestness of Eleanor's manner in pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to stay,
and Henry's gratified look on being told that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) stay was determined,
were such sweet proofs of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) importance with them, as left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) only
just so much solicitude as the human mind can never do comfortably
without. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did--almost always--believe that Henry loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), and quite
always that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father and sister loved and even wished her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to belong
to them; and believing so far, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) doubts and anxieties were merely
sportive irritations.

<p/>Henry was not able to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's injunction of remaining wholly
at Northanger in attendance on the ladies, during his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absence in London,
the engagements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) curate at Woodston obliging him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to leave them on
Saturday for a couple of nights. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) loss was not now what it had been
while the general was at home; it lessened their gaiety, but did not
ruin their comfort; and the two girls agreeing in occupation, and
improving in intimacy, found themselves so well sufficient for the time
to themselves, that it was eleven o’clock, rather a late hour at
the abbey, before they quitted the supper-room on the day of Henry's
departure. They had just reached the head of the stairs when it seemed,
as far as the thickness of the walls would allow them to judge, that a
carriage was driving up to the door, and the next moment confirmed the
idea by the loud noise of the house-bell. After the first perturbation
of surprise had passed away, in a <div class="bookquote">``Good heaven! What can be the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>it was quickly decided by Eleanor to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eldest brother, whose
arrival was often as sudden, if not quite so unseasonable, and
accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) hurried down to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>Catherine walked on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chamber, making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could, to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney, and comforting
herself under the unpleasant impression his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) conduct had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
the persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as
would make their meeting materially painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trusted he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would never
speak of Miss Thorpe; and indeed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must by this time be ashamed of
the part he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had acted, there could be no danger of it; and as long as
all mention of Bath scenes were avoided, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could behave
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) very civilly. In such considerations time passed away, and it was
certainly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) favour that Eleanor should be so glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), and
have so much to say, for half an hour was almost gone since his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) arrival,
and Eleanor did not come up.

<p/>At that moment Catherine thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) step in the gallery, and
listened for its continuance; but all was silent. Scarcely, however,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) convicted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fancy of error, when the noise of something moving
close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) door made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) start; it seemed as if someone was touching
the very doorway--and in another moment a slight motion of the lock
proved that some hand must be on it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trembled a little at the idea
of anyone's approaching so cautiously; but resolving not to be again
overcome by trivial appearances of alarm, or misled by a raised
imagination, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stepped quietly forward, and opened the door. Eleanor,
and only Eleanor, stood there. Catherine's spirits, however, were
tranquillized but for an instant, for Eleanor's cheeks were pale, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) manner greatly agitated. Though evidently intending to come in, it
seemed an effort to enter the room, and a still greater to speak when
there. Catherine, supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney's account,
could only express her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) concern by silent attention, obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be
seated, rubbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) temples with lavender-water, and hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with
affectionate solicitude. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Catherine, you must not--you must not
indeed--''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>were Eleanor's first connected words. <div class="bookquote">``I am quite well.
This kindness distracts me--I cannot bear it--I come to you on such an
errand!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Errand! To me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How shall I tell you! Oh! How shall I tell you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>A new idea now darted into Catherine's mind, and turning as pale as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) exclaimed, ```Tis a messenger from Woodston!''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>returned Eleanor, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) most
compassionately; <div class="bookquote">``it is no one from Woodston. It is my father himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) voice faltered, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes were turned to the ground as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) name. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unlooked-for return was enough in itself to make
Catherine's heart sink, and for a few moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hardly supposed
there were anything worse to be told. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said nothing; and Eleanor,
endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness, but with eyes
still cast down, soon went on. <div class="bookquote">``You are too good, I am sure, to think
the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform. I am indeed a most
unwilling messenger. After what has so lately passed, so lately been
settled between us--how joyfully, how thankfully on my side!--as to your
continuing here as I hoped for many, many weeks longer, how can I tell
you that your kindness is not to be accepted--and that the happiness
your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by--But I must not
trust myself with words. My dear Catherine, we are to part. My father
has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on
Monday. We are going to Lord Longtown's, near Hereford, for a fortnight.
Explanation and apology are equally impossible. I cannot attempt
either.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear Eleanor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, suppressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings as well as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">``do not be so distressed. A second engagement must give
way to a first. I am very, very sorry we are to part--so soon, and so
suddenly too; but I am not offended, indeed I am not. I can finish my
visit here, you know, at any time; or I hope you will come to me. Can
you, when you return from this lord's, come to Fullerton?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will not be in my power, Catherine.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come when you can, then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor made no answer; and Catherine's thoughts recurring to something
more directly interesting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, thinking aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Monday--so soon
as Monday; and you all go. Well, I am certain of--I shall be able to
take leave, however. I need not go till just before you do, you know. Do
not be distressed, Eleanor, I can go on Monday very well. My father
and mother's having no notice of it is of very little consequence. The
general will send a servant with me, I dare say, half the way--and then
I shall soon be at Salisbury, and then I am only nine miles from home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Catherine! Were it settled so, it would be somewhat less
intolerable, though in such common attentions you would have received
but half what you ought. But--how can I tell you?--tomorrow morning is
fixed for your leaving us, and not even the hour is left to your choice;
the very carriage is ordered, and will be here at seven o’clock, and no
servant will be offered you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine sat down, breathless and speechless. <div class="bookquote">``I could hardly believe
my senses, when I heard it; and no displeasure, no resentment that
you can feel at this moment, however justly great, can be more than I
myself--but I must not talk of what I felt. Oh! That I could suggest
anything in extenuation! Good God! What will your father and mother say!
After courting you from the protection of real friends to this--almost
double distance from your home, to have you driven out of the house,
without the considerations even of decent civility! Dear, dear
Catherine, in being the bearer of such a message, I seem guilty myself
of all its insult; yet, I trust you will acquit me, for you must have
been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress
of it, that my real power is nothing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have I offended the general?''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine in a faltering voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alas! For my feelings as a daughter, all that I know, all that I
answer for, is that you can have given him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) no just cause of offence. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
certainly is greatly, very greatly discomposed; I have seldom seen him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
more so. His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) temper is not happy, and something has now occurred to
ruffle it in an uncommon degree; some disappointment, some vexation,
which just at this moment seems important, but which I can hardly
suppose you to have any concern in, for how is it possible?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all; and it was only for
Eleanor's sake that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) attempted it. <div class="bookquote">``I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am very
sorry if I have offended him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). It was the last thing I would willingly
have done. But do not be unhappy, Eleanor. An engagement, you know, must
be kept. I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner, that I might
have written home. But it is of very little consequence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope, I earnestly hope, that to your real safety it will be of none;
but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence: to comfort,
appearance, propriety, to your family, to the world. Were your friends,
the Allens, still in Bath, you might go to them with comparative ease;
a few hours would take you there; but a journey of seventy miles, to be
taken post by you, at your age, alone, unattended!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, the journey is nothing. Do not think about that. And if we are to
part, a few hours sooner or later, you know, makes no difference. I
can be ready by seven. Let me be called in time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>Eleanor saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
wished to be alone; and believing it better for each that they should
avoid any further conversation, now left her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``I shall see you in
the morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine's swelling heart needed relief. In Eleanor's presence
friendship and pride had equally restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) tears, but no sooner was
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) gone than they burst forth in torrents. Turned from the house, and
in such a way! Without any reason that could justify, any apology that
could atone for the abruptness, the rudeness, nay, the insolence of
it. Henry at a distance--not able even to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) farewell. Every hope,
every expectation from him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) suspended, at least, and who could say how
long? Who could say when they might meet again? And all this by such
a man as General Tilney, so polite, so well bred, and heretofore
so particularly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)! It was as incomprehensible as it was
mortifying and grievous. From what it could arise, and where it would
end, were considerations of equal perplexity and alarm. The manner in
which it was done so grossly uncivil, hurrying her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) away without any
reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own convenience, or allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) even the appearance
of choice as to the time or mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) travelling; of two days, the
earliest fixed on, and of that almost the earliest hour, as if resolved
to have her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) gone before he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was stirring in the morning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
might not be obliged even to see her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). What could all this mean but
an intentional affront? By some means or other she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) must have had the
misfortune to offend him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Eleanor had wished to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) from so
painful a notion, but Catherine could not believe it possible that any
injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person
not connected, or, at least, not supposed to be connected with it.

<p/>Heavily passed the night. Sleep, or repose that deserved the name
of sleep, was out of the question. That room, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) disturbed
imagination had tormented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first arrival, was again the scene
of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers. Yet how different now the
source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) inquietude from what it had been then--how mournfully
superior in reality and substance! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anxiety had foundation in
fact, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears in probability; and with a mind so occupied in the
contemplation of actual and natural evil, the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation,
the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chamber, the antiquity of the building, were felt
and considered without the smallest emotion; and though the wind was
high, and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heard it all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay awake, hour after hour, without curiosity or
terror.

<p/>Soon after six Eleanor entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) room, eager to show attention or give
assistance where it was possible; but very little remained to be done.
Catherine had not loitered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was almost dressed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) packing
almost finished. The possibility of some conciliatory message from the
general occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) daughter appeared. What so natural, as
that anger should pass away and repentance succeed it? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only
wanted to know how far, after what had passed, an apology might properly
be received by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But the knowledge would have been useless here;
it was not called for; neither clemency nor dignity was put to the
trial--Eleanor brought no message. Very little passed between them on
meeting; each found her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) greatest safety in silence, and few and trivial
were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs, Catherine in
busy agitation completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dress, and Eleanor with more goodwill than
experience intent upon filling the trunk. When everything was done they
left the room, Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend
to throw a parting glance on every well-known, cherished object, and
went down to the breakfast-parlour, where breakfast was prepared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
tried to eat, as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend comfortable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no appetite, and could not
swallow many mouthfuls. The contrast between this and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) last breakfast
in that room gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fresh misery, and strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distaste for
everything before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). It was not four and twenty hours ago since they
had met there to the same repast, but in circumstances how different!
With what cheerful ease, what happy, though false, security, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
then looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), enjoying everything present, and fearing little
in future, beyond Henry's going to Woodston for a day! Happy, happy
breakfast! For Henry had been there; Henry had sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and helped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion, who sat as deep in thought as herself; and the
appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall
them to the present moment. Catherine's colour rose at the sight of it;
and the indignity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was treated, striking at that instant
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind with peculiar force, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for a short time sensible only
of resentment. Eleanor seemed now impelled into resolution and speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must write to me, Catherine,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``you must let me hear from
you as soon as possible. Till I know you to be safe at home, I shall
not have an hour's comfort. For one letter, at all risks, all hazards, I
must entreat. Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe
at Fullerton, and have found your family well, and then, till I can ask
for your correspondence as I ought to do, I will not expect more. Direct
to me at Lord Longtown's, and, I must ask it, under cover to Alice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Eleanor, if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me, I am
sure I had better not write. There can be no doubt of my getting home
safe.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div><p/>Eleanor only replied, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot wonder at your feelings. I will not
importune you. I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at
a distance from you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor/Eleanor Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>But this, with the look of sorrow accompanying
it, was enough to melt Catherine's pride in a moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) instantly
said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Eleanor, I will write to you indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>There was yet another point which Miss Tilney was anxious to settle,
though somewhat embarrassed in speaking of. It had occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) that
after so long an absence from home, Catherine might not be provided with
money enough for the expenses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) journey, and, upon suggesting it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with most affectionate offers of accommodation, it proved to be
exactly the case. Catherine had never thought on the subject till that
moment, but, upon examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) purse, was convinced that but for
this kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might have been turned from the house
without even the means of getting home; and the distress in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both, scarcely
another word was said by either during the time of their remaining
together. Short, however, was that time. The carriage was soon announced
to be ready; and Catherine, instantly rising, a long and affectionate
embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu; and,
as they entered the hall, unable to leave the house without some mention
of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) paused a
moment, and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) left
<div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) kind remembrance for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) absent friend.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But with this approach to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) name ended all possibility of restraining her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings; and, hiding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) face as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) handkerchief, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) darted across
the hall, jumped into the chaise, and in a moment was driven from the
door.




<p/>CHAPTER 29


<p/>Catherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had no
terrors for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began it without either dreading its length or
feeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage, in
a violent burst of tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was conveyed some miles beyond the walls
of the abbey before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head; and the highest point of ground
within the park was almost closed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) view before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was capable
of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) now
travelled was the same which only ten days ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had so happily passed
along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles, every
bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had first looked under impressions so different. Every mile,
as it brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nearer Woodston, added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sufferings, and when
within the distance of five, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) passed the turning which led to it, and
thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grief and agitation
were excessive.

<p/>The day which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had spent at that place had been one of the happiest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had made
use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so
spoken and so looked as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the most positive conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
actually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
elated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed regard--had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) even confused her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) too
significant reference! And now--what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) done, or what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
omitted to do, to merit such a change?

<p/>The only offence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could accuse herself had been
such as was scarcely possible to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knowledge. Henry and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had so idly
entertained; and equally safe did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret with each.
Designedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). If, indeed, by
any strange mischance his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father should have gained intelligence of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had dared to think and look for, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) causeless fancies
and injurious examinations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not wonder at any degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
indignation. If aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) having viewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as a murderer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
not wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) even turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) house. But a justification
so full of torture to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trusted, would not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) power.

<p/>Anxious as were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conjectures on this point, it was not, however,
the one on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more
prevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,
and look, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every
other, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it
sometimes suggested the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) calm acquiescence, and at others
was answered by the sweetest confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regret and resentment. To
the general, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not dare to speak; but to Eleanor--what
might he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) not say to Eleanor about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)?

<p/>In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one article
of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind was incapable of more than momentary repose, the hours
passed away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) journey advanced much faster than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) looked for.
The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) from noticing
anything before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), when once beyond the neighbourhood of Woodston,
saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) at the same time from watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) progress; and though no
object on the road could engage a moment's attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) found no stage
of it tedious. From this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was preserved too by another cause, by
feeling no eagerness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) journey's conclusion; for to return in such
a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the pleasure of a meeting
with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) loved best, even after an absence such as hers--an eleven
weeks' absence. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to say that would not humble herself and
pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) family, that would not increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own grief by the confession
of it, extend an useless resentment, and perhaps involve the innocent
with the guilty in undistinguishing ill will? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could never do justice
to Henry and Eleanor's merit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt it too strongly for expression;
and should a dislike be taken against them, should they be thought of
unfavourably, on their father's account, it would cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to the heart.

<p/>With these feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) rather dreaded than sought for the first view
of that well-known spire which would announce her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) within twenty miles of
home. Salisbury she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had known to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) point on leaving Northanger; but
after the first stage she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had been indebted to the post-masters for the
names of the places which were then to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to it; so great
had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ignorance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) route. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) met with nothing, however,
to distress or frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) youth, civil manners, and liberal
pay procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) all the attention that a traveller like herself could
require; and stopping only to change horses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) travelled on for
about eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven
o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton.

<p/>A heroine returning, at the close of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) career, to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) native village,
in all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of
a countess, with a long train of noble relations in their several
phaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well
delight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author
must share in the glory she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) so liberally bestows. But my affair is
widely different; I bring back my heroine to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) home in solitude and
disgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness.
A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no
attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>)
post-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups, and
speedy shall be her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) descent from it.

<p/>But, whatever might be the distress of Catherine's mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thus
advanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
biographer in relating it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was preparing enjoyment of no everyday
nature for those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went; first, in the appearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
carriage--and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller being
a rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the
window; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to brighten
every eye and occupy every fancy--a pleasure quite unlooked for by all
but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four years old,
who expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy the glance
that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that proclaimed the
discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful property of George
or Harriet could never be exactly understood.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the
door to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken
the best feelings of Catherine's heart; and in the embrace of each, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stepped from the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found herself soothed beyond anything
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was even
happy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a short time was
subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), leaving them at first little
leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the tea-table,
which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor traveller,
whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) notice, before any inquiry so
direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>).

<p/>Reluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) then begin what might
perhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
hearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could they
at all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) sudden
return. They were far from being an irritable race; far from any
quickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,
when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,
for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any
romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter's long and lonely
journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might have been
productive of much unpleasantness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>); that it was what they could
never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) on such
a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor
feelingly--neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had done it,
what could have provoked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to such a breach of hospitality, and so
suddenly turned all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) partial regard for their daughter into actual
ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining
as Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;
and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that <div class="bookquote">``it was a strange
business, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must be a very strange man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>grew enough for all
their indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the
sweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful
ardour. <div class="bookquote">``My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble,''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother at last; <div class="bookquote">``depend upon it, it is something not at all
worth understanding.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I can allow for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wishing Catherine away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) recollected this
engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, <div class="bookquote">``but why not do it civilly?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for the young people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Morland; <div class="bookquote">``they must
have a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;
Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General
Tilney.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine sighed. <div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) philosophic mother, <div class="bookquote">``I
am glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all
over, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good for
young people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear
Catherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but
now you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much
changing of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you
have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets.''

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
amendment, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and
alone becoming soon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only wish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) readily agreed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's
next counsel of going early to bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) parents, seeing nothing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified
feelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey,
parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) without any doubt of their being soon slept away; and
though, when they all met the next morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recovery was not equal
to their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being
any deeper evil. They never once thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart, which, for the
parents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first
excursion from home, was odd enough!

<p/>As soon as breakfast was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat down to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) promise to
Miss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
friend's disposition was already justified, for already did Catherine
reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, with
having never enough valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) merits or kindness, and never enough
commiserated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been yesterday left to endure. The
strength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pen;
and never had it been harder for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to write than in addressing Eleanor
Tilney. To compose a letter which might at once do justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
sentiments and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) situation, convey gratitude without servile regret,
be guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment--a letter
which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of--and, above all,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see, was an
undertaking to frighten away all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) powers of performance; and, after
long thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
could determine on with any confidence of safety. The money therefore
which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than grateful
thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``This has been a strange acquaintance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Morland, as the
letter was finished; <div class="bookquote">``soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens
so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and
you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well,
we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will be
better worth keeping.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) warmly answered, <div class="bookquote">``No friend can be better
worth keeping than Eleanor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do
not be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the
course of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Morland was not happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) attempt at consolation. The hope
of meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into
Catherine's head what might happen within that time to make a meeting
dreadful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
with less tenderness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did at that moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might forget
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and in that case, to meet--! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance so renewed; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as another
expedient for restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits, that they should call on Mrs.
Allen.

<p/>The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they walked,
Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) felt on the score of
James's disappointment. <div class="bookquote">``We are sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but otherwise
there is no harm done in the match going off; for it could not be
a desirable thing to have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) engaged to a girl whom we had not the
smallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without fortune; and
now, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Just at
present it comes hard to poor James; but that will not last forever; and
I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will be a discreeter man all his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life, for the foolishness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) first choice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could
listen to; another sentence might have endangered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) complaisance,
and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reply less rational; for soon were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thinking powers
swallowed up in the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own change of feelings and spirits
since last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had trodden that well-known road. It was not three months
ago since, wild with joyful expectation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had there run backwards
and forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay, and
independent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed, and
free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it. Three
months ago had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all this; and now, how altered a being did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
return!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
unlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally
call forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure,
on hearing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been treated--though Mrs. Morland's account of
it was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.
<div class="bookquote">``Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
travelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till
Saturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all
of a sudden grew tired of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) there, and almost turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out
of the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) must be a very odd
man; but we are so glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) amongst us again! And it is a great
comfort to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift
very well for herself.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable
resentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) expressions
quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
wonder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) conjectures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) explanations became in succession hers,
with the addition of this single remark--<div class="bookquote">``I really have not patience
with the general'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--to fill up every accidental pause. And, <div class="bookquote">``I really
have not patience with the general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div>was uttered twice after Mr.
Allen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any material
digression of thought. A more considerable degree of wandering attended
the third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) immediately
added, <div class="bookquote">``Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent
in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one
can hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bath
is a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above half
like coming away. Mrs. Thorpe's being there was such a comfort to us,
was not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but that did not last long,''  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes brightening
at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) existence
there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for
nothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well?
I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you
know, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember that
evening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I! Oh! Perfectly.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I
always thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) a great addition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is so very agreeable. I have a
notion you danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), but am not quite sure. I remember I had my
favourite gown on.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects,
Mrs. Allen again returned to--<div class="bookquote">``I really have not patience with the
general! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be! I do not
suppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lodgings were taken the very day after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left them, Catherine. But no
wonder; Milsom Street, you know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen/Allen</b></font>)</div><p/>As they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
daughter's mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr.
and Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or
unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could preserve the good opinion and affection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
earliest friends. There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but
there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has
very little power; and Catherine's feelings contradicted almost every
position her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother advanced. It was upon the behaviour of these very
slight acquaintance that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) present happiness depended; and
while Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own opinions by the
justness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting
that now Henry must have arrived at Northanger; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have heard
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) departure; and now, perhaps, they were all setting off for
Hereford.




<p/>CHAPTER 30


<p/>Catherine's disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habits
been ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
defects of that sort, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother could not but perceive them now to be
greatly increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could neither sit still nor employ herself for
ten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and
again, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time
in the parlour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
rambling and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) idleness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might only be a caricature of herself; but
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) silence and sadness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the very reverse of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
been before.

<p/>For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint;
but when a third night's rest had neither restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) cheerfulness,
improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) in useful activity, nor given her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) a greater inclination for
needlework, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of, <div class="bookquote">``My
dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do not
know when poor Richard's cravats would be done, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had no friend
but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for
everything--a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have
had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that
<div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head did not run upon Bath--much.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple
of you; for ten to one whether you ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) again. You should never
fret about trifles.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After a short silence--<div class="bookquote">``I hope, my Catherine, you
are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand
as Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed.
Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at home,
because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not quite
like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French bread at
Northanger.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what
I eat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much
such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by
great acquaintance--The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some
day or other, because I am sure it will do you good.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine/Morland/Catherine Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it
herself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair,
from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
needle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) daughter's absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that
repining spirit to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had now begun to attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) want of
cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,
anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some
time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could find what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) looked for; and other family matters
occurring to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
avocations above having shut out all noise but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) created herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few minutes,
till, on entering the room, the first object she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) beheld was a young
man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had never seen before. With a look of much respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
immediately rose, and being introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) conscious daughter
as <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Henry Tilney,''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>with the embarrassment of real sensibility began
to apologize for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance there, acknowledging that after what had
passed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had little right to expect a welcome at Fullerton, and stating
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impatience to be assured of Miss Morland's having reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) home
in safety, as the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intrusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not address himself to
an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far from comprehending him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister in their father's misconduct, Mrs. Morland had been always
kindly disposed towards each, and instantly, pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance,
received him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the simple professions of unaffected benevolence;
thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for such an attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) daughter, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that
the friends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) children were always welcome there, and entreating
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to say not another word of the past.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was
greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that
moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in silence
to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained for some minutes most civilly
answering all Mrs. Morland's common remarks about the weather and
roads. Catherine meanwhile--the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish
Catherine--said not a word; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) glowing cheek and brightened eye
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay aside the
first volume of The Mirror for a future hour.

<p/>Desirous of Mr. Morland's assistance, as well in giving encouragement,
as in finding conversation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) guest, whose embarrassment on his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
father's account she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early
dispatched one of the children to summon him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>); but Mr. Morland was from
home--and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of
an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes' unbroken
silence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
mother's entrance, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.
Allen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
perplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable
would have given, immediately expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intention of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
respects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would
have the goodness to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the way. <div class="bookquote">``You may see the house from this
window, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div>was information on Sarah's side, which produced only a
bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary
consideration in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
might have some explanation to give of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's behaviour, which it
must be more pleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to communicate only to Catherine, would
not on any account prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). They began their walk,
and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) object in wishing it.
Some explanation on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father's account he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had to give; but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first
purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached Mr. Allen's
grounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had done it so well that Catherine did not think it could
ever be repeated too often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) affection; and that
heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty equally
knew was already entirely his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own; for, though Henry was now sincerely
attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt and delighted in all the excellencies
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) character and truly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) society, I must confess that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
affection originated in nothing better than gratitude, or, in other
words, that a persuasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been the only
cause of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a serious thought. It is a new circumstance in
romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an heroine's
dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a wild
imagination will at least be all my own.

<p/>A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,
without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips, dismissed them
to the ecstasies of another tete-a-tete; and before it was suffered to
close, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was enabled to judge how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sanctioned by parental
authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) present application. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) return from Woodston, two
days before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been met near the abbey by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) impatient father,
hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland's departure, and ordered
to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) no more.

<p/>Such was the permission upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had now offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand.
The affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
listened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution
with which Henry had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from the necessity of a conscientious
rejection, by engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faith before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mentioned the subject; and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's conduct, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant
delight. The general had had nothing to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of, nothing to lay
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) charge, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being the involuntary, unconscious object of a
deception which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pride could not pardon, and which a better pride
would have been ashamed to own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was guilty only of being less rich
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
possessions and claims, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance in Bath,
solicited her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) company at Northanger, and designed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
daughter-in-law. On discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) error, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from the house
seemed the best, though to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feelings an inadequate proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
resentment towards herself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) contempt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) family.

<p/>John Thorpe had first misled him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). The general, perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son
one night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss
Morland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) knew more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man
of General Tilney's importance, had been joyfully and proudly
communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation
of Morland's engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon
marrying Catherine himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vanity induced him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) to represent the
family as yet more wealthy than his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vanity and avarice had made him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
believe them. With whomsoever he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was, or was likely to be connected, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their fortune.
The expectations of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) friend Morland, therefore, from the first
overrated, had ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) introduction to Isabella been gradually
increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the grandeur of the
moment, by doubling what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) chose to think the amount of Mr. Morland's
preferment, trebling his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) private fortune, bestowing a rich aunt, and
sinking half the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was able to represent the whole family
to the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine, however, the
peculiar object of the general's curiosity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own speculations,
he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or fifteen thousand
pounds which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would be a pretty addition to Mr.
Allen's estate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) intimacy there had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) seriously determine on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) therefore
as the almost acknowledged future heiress of Fullerton naturally
followed. Upon such intelligence the general had proceeded; for never
had it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) to doubt its authority. Thorpe's interest in the
family, by his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) sister's approaching connection with one of its members,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own views on another -LRB-circumstances of which he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) boasted with
almost equal openness-RRB-, seemed sufficient vouchers for his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) truth; and
to these were added the absolute facts of the Allens being wealthy and
childless, of Miss Morland's being under their care, and--as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
acquaintance allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) to judge--of their treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) with parental
kindness. His (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) resolution was soon formed. Already had he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) discerned a
liking towards Miss Morland in the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) son; and thankful
for Mr. Thorpe's communication, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) almost instantly determined to spare
no pains in weakening his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) boasted interest and ruining his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) dearest
hopes. Catherine herself could not be more ignorant at the time of all
this, than his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own children. Henry and Eleanor, perceiving nothing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) situation likely to engage their father's particular respect, had
seen with astonishment the suddenness, continuance, and extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
attention; and though latterly, from some hints which had accompanied an
almost positive command to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son of doing everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) power to
attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), Henry was convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's believing it to be
an advantageous connection, it was not till the late explanation at
Northanger that they had the smallest idea of the false calculations
which had hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on. That they were false, the general had learnt
from the very person who had suggested them, from Thorpe himself, whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had chanced to meet again in town, and who, under the influence of
exactly opposite feelings, irritated by Catherine's refusal, and
yet more by the failure of a very recent endeavour to accomplish a
reconciliation between Morland and Isabella, convinced that they were
separated forever, and spurning a friendship which could be no longer
serviceable, hastened to contradict all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had said before to
the advantage of the Morlands--confessed himself to have been totally
mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) opinion of their circumstances and character, misled by
the rhodomontade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) friend to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father a man of substance
and credit, whereas the transactions of the two or three last weeks
proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to be neither; for after coming eagerly forward on the first
overture of a marriage between the families, with the most liberal
proposals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had, on being brought to the point by the shrewdness of
the relator, been constrained to acknowledge himself incapable of
giving the young people even a decent support. They were, in fact, a
necessitous family; numerous, too, almost beyond example; by no means
respected in their own neighbourhood, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had lately had particular
opportunities of discovering; aiming at a style of life which their
fortune could not warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy
connections; a forward, bragging, scheming race.

<p/>The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring
look; and here too Thorpe had learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) error. The Allens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) believed,
had lived near them too long, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) knew the young man on whom the
Fullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more. Enraged with
almost everybody in the world but himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) set out the next day for
the abbey, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) performances have been seen.

<p/>I leave it to my reader's sagacity to determine how much of all this
it was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how
much of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could have learnt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father, in what points his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
conjectures might assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and what portion must yet remain to be
told in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they must
divide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that in
suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) wife,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had scarcely sinned against his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) character, or magnified his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) cruelty.

<p/>Henry, in having such things to relate of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) father, was almost
as pitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) blushed for the
narrow-minded counsel which he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was obliged to expose. The conversation
between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind. Henry's
indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on comprehending
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father's views, and being ordered to acquiesce in them, had been
open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary occasion to
give the law in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) family, prepared for no reluctance but of feeling,
no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in words, could ill
brook the opposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son, steady as the sanction of reason and
the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in such a cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate Henry, who was
sustained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) purpose by a conviction of its justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt himself
bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss Morland, and believing
that heart to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been directed to gain, no unworthy
retraction of a tacit consent, no reversing decree of unjustifiable
anger, could shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fidelity, or influence the resolutions it
prompted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steadily refused to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father into Herefordshire, an
engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of
Catherine, and as steadily declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intention of offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
hand. The general was furious in his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) anger, and they parted in dreadful
disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours
were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,
and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) journey to
Fullerton.




<p/>CHAPTER 31


<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Morland's surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for
their consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,
considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an
attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more
natural than Catherine's being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it
with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they
alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pleasing
manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having
never heard evil of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), it was not their way to suppose any evil could
be told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) character
needed no attestation. <div class="bookquote">``Catherine would make a sad, heedless young
housekeeper to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother's foreboding remark; but quick
was the consolation of there being nothing like practice.

<p/>There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that one
was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the engagement.
Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady, and while
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could not allow
themselves to encourage it. That the general should come forward to
solicit the alliance, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) should even very heartily approve it,
they were not refined enough to make any parading stipulation; but
the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and that once
obtained--and their own hearts made them trust that it could not be
very long denied--their willing approbation was instantly to follow. His (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
consent was all that they wished for. They were no more inclined than
entitled to demand his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) money. Of a very considerable fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) son
was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) present income was
an income of independence and comfort, and under every pecuniary view,
it was a match beyond the claims of their daughter.

<p/>The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. They
felt and they deplored--but they could not resent it; and they parted,
endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each believed
almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them again in
the fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what was now
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) only home, to watch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) young plantations, and extend his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
improvements for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sake, to whose share in them he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked anxiously
forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether the
torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence, let
us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did--they had been too kind
to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter, as, at
that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another way.

<p/>The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the portion
of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its final
event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who will
see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we are
all hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which their
early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable
circumstance could work upon a temper like the general's? The
circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) daughter with
a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course of
the summer--an accession of dignity that threw him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) into a fit of good
humour, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) forgiveness of Henry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) permission for him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``to be a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
liked it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) removal from all the evils of such
a home as Northanger had been made by Henry's banishment, to the home of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) choice and the man of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) choice, is an event which I expect to
give general satisfaction among all her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) acquaintance. My own joy on the
occasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending
merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy
felicity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) unexpected accession to title and fortune had
removed all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) difficulties; and never had the general loved his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
daughter so well in all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hours of companionship, utility, and patient
endurance as when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first hailed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Your Ladyship!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband was
really deserving of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) peerage, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wealth, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attachment, being to a precision the most charming young man in the
world. Any further definition of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) merits must be unnecessary; the
most charming young man in the world is instantly before the imagination
of us all. Concerning the one in question, therefore, I have only to
add--aware that the rules of composition forbid the introduction of a
character not connected with my fable--that this was the very
gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that collection of
washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at Northanger, by which my
heroine was involved in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) most alarming adventures.

<p/>The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother's behalf
was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland's circumstances
which, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they
were qualified to give. It taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had been scarcely
more misled by Thorpe's first boast of the family wealth than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were
they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand
pounds. This was so material an amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) late expectations that
it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) pride; and by no
means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was at
some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at
the disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every
greedy speculation.

<p/>On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor's marriage,
permitted his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) son to return to Northanger, and thence made him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) the
bearer of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty
professions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon followed:
Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and everybody smiled;
and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the first day of their
meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful delays occasioned by
the general's cruelty, that they were essentially hurt by it. To begin
perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is
to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the
general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to
their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their
knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment,
I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the
tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or
reward filial disobedience.

<p/>A NOTE ON THE TEXT

<p/>Northanger Abbey was written in 1797-98 under a different title. The
manuscript was revised around 1803 and sold to a London publisher,
Crosbie & Co., who sold it back in 1816. The Signet Classic text
is based on the first edition, published by John Murray, London, in
1818--the year following Miss Austen's death. Spelling and punctuation
have been largely brought into conformity with modern British usage.
